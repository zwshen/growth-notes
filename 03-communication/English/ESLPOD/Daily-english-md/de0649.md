This episode is all about love and hate.  It’s call ed “Disliking (or not liking) a Sibling’s (that is, brother or sister’s) Boyfriend or Girlfriend.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Georgia:  So I thought Carla was nice.

Andy:  You did?  I didn’t get that impression at al l.  I don’t know what Brian sees in her.

Georgia:  Really?  I thought she was really trying to make a good impression.

Andy:  Yeah, she was trying too  hard.  She laughed too loudly at my jokes and complimented you too much on your cooking.

Georgia:  Maybe she was a little too eager, but tha t just shows that she really likes our brother.  What’s wrong with that?

Andy:  Nothing is wrong with that, but did you see how clingy she was?  She wouldn’t leave Brian’s side for a minute, spoke for  him, and finished his sentences.  I just found that really annoying.

Georgia:  Brian didn’t seem to mind and that’s what  really counts.  Maybe he likes having an attentive girlfriend.

Andy:  There’s attentive and there’s smothering.  S he just seemed really possessive, that’s all.

Georgia:  Methinks the gentleman doth protest too m uch.

 Andy:  What do you mean by that?

Georgia:  I think you might like Carla a little too  much for your own good.  Shame on you, being interested in your own brother’s girl friend.

Andy:  Are you crazy?!  Didn’t I just tell you that  I didn’t like her at all?

Georgia:  Yes, but you said it with such passion!

Georgia says to Andy, her brother, “So I thought Ca rla was nice.”  Andy is surprised, he says, “You did?  I didn’t get that im pression at all.”  “To get an impression” means to understand a situation in a pa rticular way, usually different from the way someone else understood the situation.   You and your friend could have a conversation with someone, and then later the two of you talk about that conversation and each of you had a very different v iew about what happened; you didn’t get the same impression.  Andy says, “I don’t know what Brian sees in her.”  When we talk about what someone “sees in” so meone else, we mean what are the things that the one person likes about the other, what are the things that they are attracted to in the other person.  Now, Br ian is the brother of Andy and Georgia, and Brian’s girlfriend is named Carla.  So , Andy doesn’t like Carla; he doesn’t see what Brian sees in her.

Georgia says, “Really?  I thought she was really tr ying to make a good impression.”  “To make a good impression” – that wo rd again, “impression” – means to do or say things that will make another pe rson like you, and will say and think good things about you.  There’s an old ex pression: “You only have one chance to make a first impression.”  That is, there ’s only one opportunity for someone to meet you for the first time, logically, so you always want to present yourself well.

Georgia thought that Carla was trying to make a goo d impression.  Andy says, “Yeah, she was trying too  hard (too much).  She laughed too loudly at my jok es (that is, she laughed more than she should have) an d complimented you too much on your cooking.”  “To compliment” (compliment ) means to say something nice to make someone feel good about some action th at they did.  A husband should always compliment his wife on her beautiful face, on her hair, on her shoes – even if he doesn’t notice that they are new  shoes that she just bought last weekend, and would have no way of knowing that  they were new because he doesn’t normally look at her shoes for example!

 Andy says that Carla is trying too hard.  Georgia s ays, “Maybe she was a little too eager (eager).”  “To be eager” means to be exci ted about something, really looking forward to doing something.  “The students were eager to go to lunch.” They really wanted to eat and get out of the terrib le math class they were in or something.  Well, Georgia says that Carla was a lit tle too eager, “but that just shows that she really likes our brother.  What’s wr ong with that?”  Andy says, “Nothing is wrong with that (that’s okay), but did you see how clingy she was?” “Clingy” (clingy) means that a person depends on so meone else too much; they want to spend all of their time with them.  Sometim es when you get a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend one person wants to s pend more time with the other – calling her day and night, wanting to be with her  all the time – so that you might think the person is being clingy.  They’re trying t o be too close and too dependent on the other person.  “Clingy” has a couple of diff erent meanings in English, and those are found in the Learning Guide.

Andy says, “She (meaning Carla) wouldn’t leave Bria n’s side for a minute.” “Brian’s side” meaning she wouldn’t leave Brian.  S he spoke for him, and she finished his sentences.  “To speak for (someone)” i s to answer questions that someone else is asking that person.  So, someone wi ll ask a question of Brian but Brian doesn’t respond; Carla gives the answer.  That’s to speak for someone. You can also speak for someone in the sense that yo u have the authority to give someone else’s opinion about a topic who isn’t ther e.  But in this case, it’s just Carla answering questions that people are asking Br ian.  She also finishes his sentences.  This is when you are talking and before  you finish your sentence the person you’re talking to, right in the middle, will  interrupt you – will finish the sentence for you.  That can be very annoying!  Andy  says, “I just found that really annoying,” meaning irritating, makes you sort of an gry – a little angry.

Georgia does not agree; she says, “Brian didn’t see m to mind (meaning it didn’t bother him) and that’s what really counts (meaning that’s what’s really important).”  “Count” has a couple of other meaning s in English; you can find those, well, in the Learning Guide.  Georgia says t hat maybe Brian likes to have an attentive girlfriend.  Someone who is “attentive ” pays attention to the other person, tries to do what that other person wants or  needs.

Of course, Andy does not agree.  He says, “There’s attentive and there’s smothering.”  There are a couple of things here.  “ To smother” (smother) means to pay too much attention to someone, so that the p erson doesn’t feel they can be free.  Literally, you can use the verb “to smoth er” to kill someone, usually by putting a piece of clothing in their face so they c an’t breathe, or a pillow.  If you ever read Shakespeare’s Othello , this is what happens to one of the main

characters.  If you haven’t, of course, I won’t tel l you the rest of the story!  Here, “smother” just means that the person doesn’t feel f ree, feels the other person is being too attentive.  Andy says, “There’s attentive  and there’s smothering.”  This construction, “there’s (something) and there’s (som ething else),” is an informal way to show that two things are very different, tha t there is a big contrast between them.  Andy says that Carla just seemed rea lly possessive.”  Someone who is “possessive” wants to have something and no one else can have it, no one else can share it.

Georgia thinks now that there is some other reason why Andy doesn’t like – or says he doesn’t like Carla.  She then uses, speakin g of Shakespeare, a famous line partially from Shakespeare, from the play Haml et : “Methinks the gentleman doth protest too much.”  “Methinks” is an old Engli sh way of saying “I think,” no one says that anymore.  “Doth” is an old form of “d oes.”  “To protest” means to argue against something.  The original expression w as “The lady doth protest too much, methinks,” but the more common usage is to pu t “methinks” first. “Methinks the (in this case) gentlemen (since Andy is a man) doth protest too much.”  Well, what does this mean?  It means that s omeone is denying something.  They’re saying they don’t like somethin g, but in fact they really do like someone or something.  So, that you try to pre tend that you don’t like this person or this thing when the reality is – when in fact you like that person very much but you don’t want anyone else to know about i t.

Andy says, “What do you mean by that?”  Georgia say s, “I think you might like Carla a little too much for your own good.”  The ex pression “too much for your own good” means that you have so much of something that it becomes a bad thing.  If you like candy that’s great, but if you eat two pounds of candy a day, that’s too much for your own good.  In this case, G eorgia thinks that Andy really likes Carla, likes her in a romantic way.  She says , “Shame on you, being interested in your own brother’s girlfriend.”  The expression “shame on you,” or “shame on Andy,” is used to make someone feel bad a bout something they have said or done.  “Shame on you for criticizing your g randmothers cooking.”  You should never do that, shame on you!

Well, Georgia is saying shame on you, Andy, because  she thinks Andy actually likes Carla and would like Carla to be, I guess, hi s girlfriend – assuming he doesn’t have a girlfriend.  Of course, Andy denies this – doesn’t agree with Georgia.  He says, “Are you crazy?!  Didn’t I just tell you that I didn’t like her at all (not even a little bit)?”  Georgia says, “Yes, but you said it with such passion (passion)!”  “Passion” is a strong emotion, a stron g feeling, a strong opinion often about a romantic interest.  So, Georgia is saying y es, you said you don’t like her, but you said it in such a way that makes me think t hat you really do like her.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
