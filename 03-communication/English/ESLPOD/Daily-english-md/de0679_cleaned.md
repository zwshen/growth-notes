# Getting a Makeover

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 679: Getting a Makeover.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 679.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  This episode, like all of our current episodes, has an 8- to 10-page Learning Guide that you can download on our website.  Go to eslpod.com.  This episode is about a “makeover,” when someone tries to change their physical appearance for the better, to change it to make them look better.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Kurt:  Come with me.  Ellie:  Where are you taking me?    Kurt:  I’m giving you a makeover and you have no say about it.    Ellie:  A makeover?!  I don’t need a makeover.  Kurt:  Yes, you do.  I’m your best friend and this is an intervention.  You’re so busy these days that you’ve let yourself go.    Ellie:  I haven’t let myself go.  I just don’t spend as much time as I used to primping and getting dolled up, that’s all.  Kurt:  On that we agree.  Your clothes are frumpy and your hairstyle is 10 years out-of-date.  Come on.  I’m taking you to get a new look.  It’ll be a complete transformation.  Ellie:  Okay, I admit that my appearance needs a little updating, but I’m not giving you free rein on what changes to make.  Kurt:  I’m willing to let you have some say in that – if you come quietly.    Ellie:  And if I don’t?
