This episode is a dialogue describing people’s “hei ght,” how tall they are, as well as their “build,” what they look like: are they fat , are they skinny, and so forth. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Gwen:  Do you see that heavyset guy over there, the  one towering over everyone else? 

Denzel:  Yeah, what about him?   

Gwen:  He’s my ex-boyfriend.  I haven’t seen him in  years.  When I knew him he was really skinny.  He’s really put on a few pounds .  It’s amazing what a few years can do. 

Denzel:  None of us are as svelte as we used to be.  

Gwen:  That’s true enough.  I’m not as petite as I used to be, that’s for sure.   

Denzel:  How come you’ve never mentioned this ex-bo yfriend before? 

Gwen:  Oh, I’d almost forgotten about him.  Oh, no.   I hope that guy over there didn’t see me.   

Denzel:  Who?  That short, stocky guy?   

Gwen:  No, the average height guy who’s walking thi s way.  He’s another one of my exes.  I’d hoped never to see him again.  

 Denzel:  It was a bad breakup? 

Gwen:  Right.  Let’s head toward the door.   

Denzel:  Why hadn’t you mentioned him before? 

Gwen:  I thought I had.  There have been so many…  

Denzel:  Don’t look now, but your ex is also headed  toward the door. 

Gwen:  Which one?   

Denzel:  The tall medium build guy walking next to you! 

[end of dialogue] 

There are many words we can used to describe someon e physically; it’s impossible to include all of these in a single dial ogue.  This dialogue only talks about how tall or short someone is, as well as thei r shape and weight, in a way. 

Gwen says to Denzel, “Do you see that heavyset guy over there, the one towering over everyone else?”  “Heavyset” (heavyset ) is someone who is a little overweight, perhaps.  They weigh a little too much;  they’re a little fat, but they’re also very large and often very strong.  They might have a lot of muscles, like me. Yeah!  Well, not really.  Gwen says, “Do you see th at heavyset guy over there, the one towering over everyone else?”  “To tower (t ower) over (someone)” means to be much taller than everyone else, or much  taller than the person next to you. 

Denzel says, “Yeah, what about him?”  Gwen says tha t this heavyset guy is her ex-boyfriend.  Your “boyfriend” is the man, or boy,  you are interested in romantically; the other term, of course, would be “ girlfriend.”  “Ex-boyfriend” would be someone who used to be your boyfriend, but  you’re not together romantically anymore.  Gwen says, “I haven’t seen h im in years (I haven’t seen this heavyset guy in years).  When I knew him he wa s really skinny.”  “To be skinny” (skinny) means to be very thin; we might sa y “slim” or “slender” (slender). “Slim,” “slender,” “thin,” “skinny,” these are all the same idea, someone who doesn’t have a lot of extra weight, who is the oppo site of fat.  Gwen says that the ex-boyfriend really put on a few pounds.  “To put o n a few pounds” (pounds) means to gain weight, usually over time.  As people  get older, especially after, oh, the age of 30 or so, it’s not uncommon for them  to put on a few pounds, to  

gain weight, to become heavier or fatter.  “Pound” has a number of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for some of those.   

Gwen says, “It’s amazing what a few years can do,” meaning it’s surprising how someone can change physically in just a few years.  Denzel says, “None of us are as svelte as we used to be.”  “Svelte” (svelte)  means to be slender, to be thin. But the difference between “svelte” and “skinny” is  that when you say you’re “svelte” you mean you are perhaps somewhat muscular  or you are svelte in a way that looks very attractive.  You can be skinny and not be very attractive, but when you’re svelte usually you not only are thin bu t you also have a good muscular look about you as well.  At least that’s a  common way of using this word.  Gwen says, “That’s true enough.  I’m not as petite as I used to be.”  “To be petite” (petite) is to be a thin or skinny woman wh o’s usually somewhat small or short.  A petite woman is not very tall and is thin .  If you go to a store, and you’re woman and you’re buying a dress, they have differen t sizes, and petite might be one of the sizes they have.  That would be for a wo man who’s not very tall and who is thin. 

Denzel then asks Gwen, “How come you’ve never menti oned this ex-boyfriend before?”  Why haven’t you told me about this ex-boy friend?  Gwen said, “Oh, I’d almost forgotten about him.”  I couldn’t remember h im, maybe because it was so long ago.  Then she says, “Oh, no.  I hope that guy  over there didn’t see me.” Gwen is now talking about a different person.  Gwen  says, “I hope that guy over there didn’t see me.”  Denzel says, “Who?  That sho rt, stocky guy?”  “To be short” means the opposite of tall, someone who’s be low average in height. “Short” has a number of meanings in English however ; take a look, once again, at our Learning Guide for those.  “To be stocky” (s tocky) means to be a little heavy.  You could be a little fat, or you might jus t have a lot of strong muscles. Normally it describes someone who is perhaps not ve ry tall, but they’re heavy; they’re slightly overweight and/or they have a lot of muscles, so they look big.   

Gwen says, “No,” she’s not talking about the short,  stocky guy; she’s talking about the guy who is of average height.  “Height” r efers to how tall or short you are.  “Average” would be someone who is about the s ame as most people; “typical” would be another way of saying that.  Sta tistically, “average” is the same as what we call the “mean” (mean).  The mean of 5 a nd 15 is 10; 5 plus 15 is 20, divided by 2 is 10.  Well, here we’re talking about  an average height, how tall someone is.  Gwen says that there’s an average heig ht guy walking this way, meaning walking toward Gwen and Denzel.  She says, “He’s another one of my exes (another ex-boyfriend).  I’d hoped never to se e him again.”  She doesn’t want to see this person. 

Denzel says, “It was a bad breakup?”  A “breakup” ( breakup – one word) is the end of a romantic relationship, when two people dec ide they’re not going to be together romantically anymore; you’re no longer boy friend and girlfriend.  Denzel says, “It was a bad breakup?”  Gwen says, “Right,” meaning yes.  Notice that Gwen seems to have a lot of ex-boyfriends, and Denz el doesn’t seem to know anything about them.  Is that a good idea?  Should you tell your boyfriend or your girlfriend about all of the old boyfriends or girlf riends you used to have?  I don’t know; I don’t know if that’s a good idea.  I don’t think so, generally.  Maybe I’m wrong; I don’t have very many ex-girlfriends to tal k about!  In general, I think it’s a bad idea.  Well anyway, Gwen says, “Let’s head towa rd the door.”  Let’s start walking out of here, to leave.   

Denzel says, “Why hadn’t you mentioned him before?”   Denzel wants to know why Gwen hasn’t told him about her ex-boyfriends.  Again, personally I don’t care.  I don’t want to know about your ex-boyfriend s, but Denzel wants to know. Gwen says, “I thought I had (I thought I did tell y ou).  There have been so many.” She’s saying that she’s had many boyfriends.  Now t hat’s probably a mistake ladies!  You don’t want to tell your current boyfri end, the guy you’re with right now, that you’ve had lots of boyfriends in the past .  That doesn’t look too good sometimes.  And, I would say probably the same for a man telling that to a woman.  But in any case, Gwen tells Denzel that she  has had many boyfriends. 

Denzel says, “Don’t look now, but your ex is also h eaded toward the door.” “Don’t look now” is a phrase we use to warn someone  that something bad is coming their way or someone they don’t want to see is walking toward them. Denzel says, “Don’t look now, but your ex (your ex- boyfriend) is also headed toward the door.”  Gwen says, “Which one?”  She thi nks Denzel is talking about the heavyset guy or the average height guy, but Den zel says, “The tall medium build guy walking next to you!”  “Tall,” of course,  is the opposite of short.  “To be medium (medium) build (build)” means that you’re no t fat, you’re not thin; you’re sort of average in terms of the size of your body.  So, Denzel is talking about a tall medium build guy walking next to Gwen, meaning  himself.  He’s saying that now he is going to break up with Gwen, and Gwen is walking next to her newest ex-boyfriend! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Gwen:  Do you see that heavyset guy over there, the  one towering over everyone else? 

Denzel:  Yeah, what about him?   

Gwen:  He’s my ex-boyfriend.  I haven’t seen him in  years.  When I knew him he was really skinny.  He’s really put on a few pounds .  It’s amazing what a few years can do. 

Denzel:  None of us are as svelte as we used to be.  

Gwen:  That’s true enough.  I’m not as petite as I used to be, that’s for sure.   

Denzel:  How come you’ve never mentioned this ex-bo yfriend before? 

Gwen:  Oh, I’d almost forgotten about him.  Oh, no.   I hope that guy over there didn’t see me.   

Denzel:  Who?  That short, stocky guy?   

Gwen:  No, the average height guy who’s walking thi s way.  He’s another one of my exes.  I’d hoped never to see him again. 

Denzel:  It was a bad breakup? 

Gwen:  Right.  Let’s head toward the door.   

Denzel:  Why hadn’t you mentioned him before? 

Gwen:  I thought I had.  There have been so many…  

Denzel:  Don’t look now, but your ex is also headed  toward the door. 

Gwen:  Which one?   

Denzel:  The tall medium build guy walking next to you!
