<h1>Many paths, one destination</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
In life, one has many paths to choose, leading to many different lives.
Philosophers have long thought about this problem, that can now be
studied using computers and mathematics. 
</p>
<p>
The objective of this task is to enumerate how many different lives
one can live, given a specific set of choices at each point in time.
One is given a list of events, and a number of choices that can be
selected, for each event. The objective is to count how many ways exist
to go from event zero (birth) to an event that has no choices
(death). 
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
nput contains several test cases separated by a blank line. The first number in the each test case is the number of
events. It is followed by a list of events. Each event is described by
a number, n, (possibly 0) of choices. For every one of the n
possible choices, follows a list of the next event (with sequence
number larger than the present event) that will happen
when that choice is picked. An event with no choices (n=0) 
represents a death. It has no further events in life. The first
event, event number 0, represents birth.
</p>


<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
The output for each test case is simply an integer that represents how many different ways
it is possible to live that particular life. This number will always
be less than 2 to the 30th. Print a blank line between test cases.
