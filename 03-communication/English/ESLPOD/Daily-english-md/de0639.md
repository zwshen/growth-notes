This episode is a dialogue at a restaurant between Paul o and the waiter – actually the waitress.  Here we call her the “server,” it’ s the same thing.  They’re going to be talking about soups and salads, so lots of vo cabulary related to soups and salads in this episode.  Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

After a long tiring day at work, I stopped at a restaur ant nearby for a quick meal.

Server:  Hi, I’m Ursula.  Can I get you something to dr ink?

Paulo:  Yes, I’d like an iced tea and I’m also ready to  order.  I’ll just have a bowl of soup and a salad.

Server:  Sure, no problem.  What kind of soup would you  like?  We have chicken noodle, minestrone, and cream of mushroom.

Paulo:  Do you have something that’s hearty?

Server:  If you want something hearty, I would suggest our clam chowder or beef stew.

Paulo:  I’ll take a bowl of beef stew.

Server:  Great!  What kind of salad would you like: a che f salad, Caesar salad, or Cobb salad?

Paulo:  I’ll just have a garden salad.

 Server:  Okay, what kind of dressing would you like?

Paulo:  What kind do you have?

Server:  We have French, Italian, ranch, Thousand Island,  and vinaigrette.

Paulo:  Do you have blue cheese?

Server:  Oh yes, I forget to mention blue cheese.  Okay, that’s a bowl of beef stew and a garden salad with blue cheese dressing.  Will that be all?

Paulo:  Yes, that’s all. … By the time I had finished placing my order, I was even m ore tired.  Do you sometimes feel that life gives you too many choices?

Our dialogue begins with Paulo telling us that he is g oing to a restaurant for a quick meal.  He says he’s had a long tiring day.  A “tirin g day” is a day that makes you tired, that makes your body feel weak or sleepy or tired.  He sits down and the server, whose name is Ursula, comes in and says, “H i, I’m Ursula.  Can I get you something to drink?”  Ursula is not a common wom an’s name anymore.  I once knew a Sister Ursula, but that’s a different story.

Paulo says, “Yes, I’d like an iced tea and I’m also ready to order.  I’ll just have a bowl of soup and a salad.”  When he says “I’ll have” he means this is what I want to order.  When he says “I’ll just have” he means just this and nothing else.  He’s going to order a “soup,” which is a bowl of hot food, usually liquid or there’s liquid in it, that you eat with a spoon.  Or, he’s going to h ave a “salad,” which is when you have many different vegetables or possibly fruits, usual ly uncooked, that are torn into small pieces.  The most common vegetable in a salad is lettuce, which is typically green, although it can be red and perhaps bl ue – no, I don’t think it can be blue, just kidding!

Ursula says, “Sure, no problem.  What kind of soup would you like?”  That’s a very polite way of asking: “would you like?”  “What kind of soup would you like?” What kind of soup do you want?  She says, “We have chicken n oodle, minestrone, and cream of mushroom.”  “Chicken noodle so up” has small pieces of cooked chicken and long, spaghetti-like noodles.  In the United States, it’s considered a food that you eat when you are not feelin g well.  When you have a cold, for example, your mother will make you a bowl of hot chicken soup –

 chicken noodle soup.  “Minestrone” (minestrone) is a soup we associate with Italy.  In Italian restaurants, at least in the U.S., t his soup has different kinds of vegetables and often a little bit of pasta.  It’s typical ly in a salty tomato, or perhaps spinach-based liquid.  “Cream of mushroom” is a  thick soup made from heavy cream or milk that has been blended together – put  together with cooked mushrooms and other spices.

Paulo says, “Do you have something that’s hearty?”  The ad jective “hearty” (hearty), when used, in this case with soup, means somethi ng that will make you feel full after you finish eating it.  It’s very large,  and we would probably say it is filling.  A meal that is “filling” (filling) is a mea l that makes you feel like you can’t eat any more when you are done eating it.

The server says, “If you want something hearty, I would sugg est our clam chowder or beef stew.”  “Clam chowder” is another thick s oup that is made with clams; “clams” are animals that live in the ocean, in wh at’s called a shell.  It’s also made with potatoes, heavy cream, sometimes bacon.  Tha t is what we call, actually, New England clam chowder.  In the Midwest, in Minnesota where I’m from, we called it Boston clam chowder.  Boston is in the region of the United States known as New England, which is in the northeast pa rt of the U.S., the oldest part of the United States when it comes to colo nists who came from Europe.  The other kind of clam chowder is red instead of white.  New England clam chowder is white.  The other kind of clam chowder is red; it uses tomatoes instead of milk or cream, and that is called Manhattan clam chowder.  Manhattan is a part of New York City.  In fact, I think when I was growing up we sometimes called it New York clam chowder.  In any case, you have these  two kinds of clam chowder.  Clam chowder in the United States has traditi onally been served on Fridays.  Restaurants would have clam chowder on Fridays.  T hat was because there used to be a requirement for Catholics – people  of the Roman Catholic religion – not to eat meat on any Friday throughout the year.  Those regulations changed in the 1960s.  However, the tradition of alwa ys having clam chowder on Friday continued with many restaurants, and still toda y when you go to a restaurant that has different kinds of soup they will oft en have a clam chowder on Friday.

The second kind of hearty soup Ursula recommends is beef stew .  “Stew” (stew) is a thick soup that is made by cooking meat, vegetables, an d potatoes in a liquid that is salty, usually, for several hours; it takes a long  time to make a good beef stew.  There are different kinds of stew; beef is the mo st common meat you will find in stews, though you can make them with other meat s of course.  In Minnesota, every fall there are beef stews that are mad e as part of large celebrations, what are called fall festivals, and the ste w is made in a very large

 pot.  This is called in Minnesota “booya” (booya).  If you go to Minnesota or the Midwest in the fall you will find booya, at least in Mi nnesota and Wisconsin. More recently, the word “booya” has taken on a different  meaning; it is often spelled with an “h” at the end, and it means sort of “ take that,” or “there you go.” It’s something you yell at someone in certain situations.  We’ll talk about that on a different episode.

Getting back to our food: Paulo says, “I’ll take a bowl of beef stew.”  “I’ll take” means same as “I’ll have,” it means “I want to order.”  The server says, “Great! What kind of salad would you like: a chef salad, Caesar s alad, or Cobb salad?” These are three common salads found in American restauran ts.  Let’s start with the chef (chef) salad.  A “chef salad” typically has lettuce , it has an egg that is completely cooked; we would call in a hard boiled egg.  It has small pieces of ham, chicken, cheese, as well as some other vegetables.  That ’s a chef salad.  A “Caesar (Caesar) salad” is a salad that has a special kind of lettuce called Romaine lettuce in a dressing – a Caesar dressing.  “Dre ssing” is the liquid that you often put on top of the salads.  A Caesar salad has ch eese; it has usually what are called “croutons,” which are small pieces of crunchy fried bread. Sometimes there’s chicken or shrimp on the top of a Caesa r salad, but not always.  The Caesar dressing itself is made from several dif ferent ingredients, including olive oil, garlic, and anchovies.  A “Cobb (Cob b) salad” is a type of salad that has different kinds of lettuce.  It also has a  hard boiled egg, small piece of ham and chicken, cheese, sometimes avocado, tomato, and on top there is what is called a “blue cheese dressing,” which is made, of course, from cheese.

Paulo doesn’t want a chef, Caesar, or Cobb salad.  He says, “I’ll just have a garden salad.”  A “garden salad” is a small, simple sal ad made with lettuce and a few other vegetables, but no meat and typically no cheese .

The server says, “What kind of dressing would you like?”  Pau lo says, “What kind do you have?”  The lovely Ursula says, “We have French, Ita lian, ranch, Thousand Island, and vinaigrette.”  All of these are ki nds of liquid dressing.  We’ll go through them quickly.  “French” is a reddish-orange d ressing made from oil, vinegar, usually some ketchup, other herbs and spices blende d together.  It’s a very smooth, thick dressing.  “Italian dressing” is almost clea r in color.  It’s also made from oil and vinegar, adding salt, pepper, someti mes some very small vegetables – small pieces of vegetables, as well as some her bs.  “Ranch dressing” is white and thick, typically made from buttermil k, sour cream, and mayonnaise.  “Thousand Island dressing” is a type of salad d ressing that is light orange, almost pink.  It’s made from mayonnaise, ketchup, minced pickles, and

 other vegetables.  “Vinaigrette” (vinaigrette) is a sim ple mixture – combination of oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper.

Once again, Paulo doesn’t like any of his choices; he says, “ Do you have blue cheese?”  We’ve already talked about that.  The server says, “Oh yes, I forget to mention blue cheese.  Okay, that’s a bowl of beef stew a nd a garden salad with blue cheese dressing.  Will that be all?”  Paulo says, “Ye s, that’s all,” meaning I don’t want any more food.

By the time he finished placing his order he says, “I was e ven more tired.  Do you sometimes feel that life gives you too many choices?”  Paulo  is tired because he had to select from long lists of food types, salads and sou ps.  But that’s not unusual in an American restaurant, where they give you of ten many choices when you are ordering your food.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

You can’t get chicken noodle soup here, but you can get some excellent scripts written by our own Dr. Lucy Tse.
