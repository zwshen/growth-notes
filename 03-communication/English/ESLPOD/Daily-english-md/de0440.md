This episode is called “Being a Self-Made Man,” or “Bei ng a Self-Made Woman.” It’s a dialogue between Ann and Edgar over what it m eans to become successful.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Edgar:  What a crock!

Ann:  What is it?

Edgar:  I’m reading an article about successful business pe ople who were self- made men and women.  I don’t believe a word of it.

Ann:  What don’t you believe?

Edgar:  These people didn’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps.  They were all born with silver spoons in their mouths.

Ann:  Not all successful people were born into money and privilege.

Edgar:  That’s true, but it gets me riled up when peo ple who grew up at the country club claim to have had humble beginnings.

Ann:  Just because some people were born with a leg up d oesn’t mean they didn’t work hard to get where they are.

 Edgar:  Where would that hard work have gotten them if they didn’t have backers with deep pockets, or if they didn’t know people in high  places?  I know plenty of hard-working people who aren’t hobnobbing with the r ich and famous.

Ann:  That’s true enough.  Who needs the rich and famo us?  I’ll take my hard- working man over any of them any day.

Edgar:  That’s why I married you – a woman with beauty and brains!

In the United States there has always been a belief tha t anyone can be successful, even though that is not always true.  This dialog ue uses some expressions that we often will say to talk about being success ful and the reasons people are successful in life.

The dialogue begins by Edgar saying, “What a crock!”  “Cro ck” (crock) is a very informal expression meaning that something is false, some thing is a lie; you should not believe this thing.  Ann says, “What is it?”  Edgar says, “I’m reading an article about successful business people who were self-made m en and women.  I don’t believe a word of it” – I don’t believe any of it is true.  “Self-made” means that you became successful or rich because you worked hard, n ot because you received help from other people.

Ann asks, “What don’t you believe?”  Edgar says, “These peo ple didn’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps.”  The expression “to pul l yourself up by your bootstraps” means to become successful because of your own eff orts – because of your own work, especially if you started as a very poor p erson or unsuccessful person.  To pull yourself up by your bootstraps means to g et out of this difficult life situation and become rich or successful, without the help of anyone else.

Edgar says, “They were all born with silver spoons in their  mouths.”  He’s talking about the people in the article that he’s reading who  say they are self-made.  But Edgar says no, “They were born with silver spoons in their  mouths.”  This is an expression, “to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth, ” that means that you were born into a rich family, because only a rich family co uld afford a spoon made of silver.  I’m not quite sure why it has to be bo rn with the spoon in your mouth, other than perhaps we feed little babies with small spoons, and put the spoon in their mouth – that makes sense.  So, to be bor n with a silver spoon in your mouth means that you were born a very rich person.  You come from a rich

 family, and therefore you weren’t pulling yourself u p by your bootstraps if you became successful.

Ann says, “Not all successful people were born into money a nd privilege.”  “To be born into money” means that you were born into a rich family.  “Privilege” (privilege) is something that is special for only a small n umber of people – for very few people.  Very few people can have this.  It’s oft en used to mean, simply, “advantage.”  “He has a lot of privileges” – he has a lot of advantages, coming from a rich family.  So, Ann is saying that not all successfu l people were born into money and born into privilege, having these economic, fin ancial advantages. “Privilege” has a couple of different meanings in Engl ish; go to our Learning Guide for this episode for some additional explanations.

Edgar says, “That’s true, but it gets me riled up when p eople who grew up at the country club claim to have had humble beginnings.”  “To b e riled (riled) up” means to be angry, to be upset, to be annoyed.  Edgar says he gets riled up when people who grew up at the country club say that the y come from humble beginnings.  The “country club,” here, refers to a place where members can participate in sports and social activities.  Usually this is a very exclusive club that costs a lot of money to become a member of.  Country clubs  often have golf courses, and require a lot of money if you want to become  a member and use the country club.  In general, when someone says or refers to “the country club,” they’re referring to people who are very rich, people w ho are living in a very rich manner, or rich way.  “Humble beginnings” means that yo u grew up in a family that did not have a lot of money.  “Humble,” here, me ans poor; “beginnings” means when you were a child, so, to have “humble beginni ngs” means that you had a childhood where you lived with a family that was p oor, or grew up with a family that did not have a lot of money.

So, what riles Edgar – what gets him riled up – is tha t people who are rich say they came from poor families.  Ann says, “Just because some  people were born with a leg up doesn’t mean they didn’t work hard to ge t where they are.”  A “leg up,” here, means an advantage, a head start, something that helps you do something faster or better.  If you are, for example, trying to learn French and you already know Spanish and Italian, you have a leg up o n other people who do not know those two romance languages, because Italian, F rench, and Spanish have many similarities.  They are similar languages, so to know one means that you have a leg up on learning the other languages.  “L eg” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

 Edgar says, “Where would that hard work have gotten the m if they didn’t have backers with deep pockets.”  So, Ann is saying, well, just be cause someone is rich doesn’t mean they don’t work hard, or didn’t work h ard to get where they are today.  Edgar is saying, well, they may work hard but that  would not have gotten them their position today if they didn’t have backers.  A “backer” is a supporter, usually someone who gives you money.  If I’m going to star t a new company, I want to start a record company so I can become a famous sing ing star, I would ask for some backers.  I would get people who would invest , or give me money to help me start my new company.

Edgar is saying that these people who are successful have ba ckers – people who give them money, like their parents – with deep pocke ts.  The expression “to have deep pockets” means to be very rich, to have a lot of money.  A “pocket” is what we call that part of your pants that you can put money into, or keys, and so forth.  Usually you have two pockets in front and two po ckets in back.  Edgar says these people would not have been successful if they didn’ t know people in high places.”  “In high places” means people who are po werful or rich or successful, and have a lot of influence.  If someone says to yo u, “I know people in high places,” they mean I know people who are very im portant, who have a lot of influence and therefore could help me.

Edgar says, “I know plenty (I know many) hard-working peo ple who aren’t hobnobbing with the rich and famous.  “To hobnob” (ho bnob) means to spend time talking with people who have a lot of money, powe r, or influence.  We might also say, nowadays, “to network.”  “Network” sounds better than “hobnobbing.” “Hobnobbing” has the idea you are trying to become successf ul by talking to other people and getting them to help you.  “To netw ork” sounds like you are looking for opportunities to become successful.  So, “hobno bbing” is probably considered a little more negatively.  “Networking” is a t erm we use now in the business world to refer to making contacts, getting to know  people who may help us in the future.

Ann says, “That’s true enough.”  She’s agreeing with Edg ar.  “Who needs the rich and famous?  I’ll take my hard-working man over any of t hem any day.”  Edgar says, “That’s why I married you – a woman with beauty and brains!”  Edgar, of course, is complimenting himself, saying his wife is very int elligent because she married him even though he doesn’t have a lot of mone y.

Let’s listen now to the dialogue at a normal speed.
