This episode is called “Feeling Disillusioned,” about some one who is sad and disappointed in something.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Daniela:  I did it.  I finally met Mandy Timpkin. 

Tony:  Mandy Timpkin, your idol?   

Daniela:  Yeah, I stood in line for two days at her b ook signing and finally met her.  It was a big disappointment. 

Tony:  Really?  I thought she could do no wrong, as far as you’re concerned.   

Daniela:  Well, that was before I met her.  I have al ways wanted to be just like her.  She had everything going for her: a great life and a great career.  I emulated her in so many ways.  I thought she must be a paragon of virtue and a great person to be around.  I walked into that bookstore wit h all of these preconceived notions. 

Tony:  What happened to shatter your image of her? 

Daniela:  While I waited in line, I saw what kind of person she really was.  She was rude to everybody and made ridiculous demands of her assistants.  It wasn’t how I pictured her at all.  She was a real diva.   

Tony:  So meeting her really burst your bubble.    

 Daniela:  Yeah, it really did.  I guess it was my own fault for putting her on a pedestal.   

Tony:  Well, you’re not the only one.  Celebrities woul dn’t be celebrities if we didn’t idolize them. 

Daniela:  True enough, and I’ve learned my lesson.  Nob ody’s perfect, least of all celebrities!

Daniela says to Tony, “I did it.  I finally met Mandy Tim pkin.”  Tony says, “Mandy Timpkin, your idol?”  An “idol” (idol) is someone you lo ve, someone you admire; you want to be like that person.  It’s often a famous p erson, it doesn’t have to be. An idol is literally something that you worship, that you  believe has almost special powers.  Some people have idols who are famous politicia ns, famous actors, podcasters perhaps – probably not!  That will be an ido l.  We especially in the U.S. have the term “teen idol,” this would be usually a  very attractive boy – they usually are boys, less than 18 years old, but they could be older – and all of the young girls fall in love with this famous singer.  That w ould be a teen idol. 

Well this is just your idol, meaning someone that you adm ire.  Daniela says, “Yeah, I stood in line (I waited) for two days at her book signing and finally met her.”  A “book signing” is an event where the author of  a book “autographs,” or writes his or her name on copies of the book for people who bought it. Bookstores sometimes have a book signings by famous authors; th ey come and they sign the book.  I’ve gone to some of these; they oft en give a little talk, which can be interesting.  Daniela says, however, that meeting  her idol Mandy Timpkin, who is obviously a writer, was a big disappointment.  “ Disappointment” means feeling sad because something that you thought was going  to be good or great was not; it was less than what you thought it would be.  That’s disappointment. 

Tony says, “Really?  I thought she could do no wrong, as fa r as you’re concerned.”  When we say someone “can do no wrong” we mea n they are perfect; they cannot make a mistake.  My wife believes I can do no wrong.  Right, honey?  She’s not answering me!  Daniela thought that Mandy Timpkin could do no wrong – was perfect.  Tony says, “as far as you’re conce rned.”  “As far as you’re concerned” or “(someone) is concerned” means in som eone’s opinion, according to this person’s belief.  As far as I’m concerned – as far as what is  

 important to me, in my opinion, we have the best listen ers in the world right here at ESL Podcast.  That’s you! 

Daniela says, “Well, that was before I met her (I thoug ht she was perfect before I actually had a chance to meet her).”  Daniela says, “I hav e always wanted to be just like her.  She had everything going for her: a gre at life and a great career.” “To have everything going for (someone)” means to be ver y fortunate, to have a lot of advantages, to be very lucky in life.  Well, Danie la says that Mandy had a great life and a great career.  She says she emulated h er in so many ways.  “To emulate” (emulate) means to copy the things that anoth er person does or says, to try to behave just like this other person.  Daniela em ulated, in the past, Mandy. She thought that Mandy must be a paragon of virtue and  a great person to be around.  A “paragon (paragon) of virtue” is someone w ho is perfect in every way, someone who has no flaws, usually someone who has very hig h what we might call moral standards.  Someone who never does anything wr ong: never cheats, never lies, never steals.  That would be a paragon of vir tue.   

Well, that’s what Daniela thought Mandy Timpkin was.  S he says, “I walked into that bookstore with all of these preconceived notions.”  A  “notion” (notion) is an idea.  A “preconceived notion” is an idea you have about something without having all of the facts, without being able to actuall y experience or observe what it is you have this idea about.  For example, some peopl e when they come to Los Angeles have a lot of preconceived notions.  They have th ings that they have heard about or read about or seen on TV or in the mo vies that makes them think they know what Los Angeles is like, and then they come here  and it’s very different.  Hollywood Boulevard, for example, which is a  very famous tourist site here in Los Angeles, people have a lot of preconceived n otions about what that’s like.  Well, if you come, you will see!  A preconceived not ion is usually wrong, that’s the implication. 

Tony said, “What happened to shatter your image of her ?”  “To shatter” (shatter) means to break something into very small pieces.  It can a lso be used to talk about how your dreams or your hopes were destroyed, how something happened that made them go way, you no longer had this dream or  this hope.  That’s what “shatter” means here.  “Shatter” actually has more defin itions, and those are in the Learning Guide.  Well, Tony wants to know what ha ppened to shatter Daniela’s image of Mandy Timpkin.  “Image,” here, mean s the ways someone appears – someone looks. 

Daniela says, “While I waited in line, I saw what kind o f person she really was. She was rude (not very nice) to everybody and made ridi culous demands of her  

 assistants.”  “Ridiculous” means crazy, not normal, way beyond what you would expect.  A “demand” is something you say you must have.  So , this woman made ridiculous demands on the people who were helping her,  her assistants.  Daniela says, “It wasn’t how I pictured her at all.  She was a re al diva.”  “To picture” means to imagine how something will be.  It has other meanings as well, this word “picture.”  The Learning Guide will tell you mor e.  Well, Daniela found out that Mandy was a real diva (diva).  A “diva” is a woman w ho has a lot of success, usually in singing or acting, but doesn’t treat other pe ople very nicely.  A diva is someone who is great at what they do but is not a very n ice person, and usually diva is applied to a woman.  I guess a man would be a “ divo,” but we never say that, if that’s the correct word.  We usually would call a man a real – well, I can’t say it on the podcast! 

Tony says, “So meeting her really burst your bubble.”  Th is expression, “to burst (burst) someone’s bubble,” means to destroy your belief, yo ur hope, the way that you saw something or someone, and now you see it is not a s good or as interesting as you thought it was.  So, it’s another way of saying a great disappointment.  Something burst your bubble; it made you see that you were wrong about what you were hoping for.   

Daniela says, “Yeah, it really did.  I guess it was my own fault for putting her on a pedestal.”  “To put (someone) on a pedestal” means to b elieve that someone is perfect, to admire them too much.  A “pedestal” is what  you put a statue of a famous person on.  So to put a person that you know on a pedestal means to think that they are great. 

Tony says, “Well, you’re not the only one.  Celebrities wo uldn’t be celebrities (that is, famous people would not be famous) if we did n’t idolize them.”  “To idolize” (idolize) is a verb that comes from the first wo rd we talked about, “idol.”  It means to admire someone too much, to think that someone  is perfect.  Daniela says, “True enough (meaning I agree, you’re right), and  I’ve learned my lesson (meaning now I have learned that I was wrong).  Nobod y’s perfect, least of all celebrities!”  “Least of all” means especially; it’s a phra se used to give emphasis to the words that follow it.  So, “Nobody’s perfect, le ast of all celebrities” means celebrities are probably the least perfect or the most f lawed of anyone. 

The title of the dialogue was “Feeling Disillusioned. ”  “To be disillusioned” means that you have dreams about how great something is and th en you are disappointed.  Usually, to be disillusioned means that you  had a vision – you had a picture of the way a situation was going to be or go ing to turn out, and then you were very bitterly, we might say, disappointed – greatly disappointed.  

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
