This episode is a dialogue between Christine and As ahi about being afraid of heights – of being far above the ground. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Christine: Help me! I’m going to fall!

Asahi: You’re not going to fall. I’ve got you.

Christine: Sorry, I have a fear of heights. I somet imes have panic attacks when I’m high up off the ground.

Asahi: Okay, but we’re not very high up.

Christine: I know. My phobia is totally irrational.

Asahi: That explains a lot, like why you live on the ground floor of your apartment building and why you didn’t want to go hiking near the cliffs.

Christine: That’s right. I try to avoid any situati ons that will trigger my fear.

Asahi: So how do you travel? Do you ever fly?

Christine: The one time I flew in an airplane I exp erienced vertigo and I hyperventilated until we landed. I was really agita ted because I thought I was going to die. It wasn’t pretty. That’s why I normal ly drive or take a train.

Asahi: So I’m guessing no skydiving for you.

 Christine: Not unless you want to find out how my s tomach reacts to heights!

[end of dialogue]

Christine begins our dialogue by yelling, “Help me!  I’m going to fall!” “To fall” (fall) means for your body to go down and hit the ground q uickly and unexpectedly. You could fall just by walking down the street, or you could be up high – on the top of a building or on a ladder or just on a chair  – and fall down. “To fall” and “to fall down” mean something similar. The phrasal verb  “to fall down” is often used in the same way as the verb “to fall.” However, the  verb “to fall” can refer to things other than just people and objects. You can also talk about prices “falling,” or going down, reducing in value. But here we’re ta lking about poor Christine.

Asahi says, “You’re not going to fall. I’ve got you .” The expression “I’ve got you” means that I will protect you. I will protect you f rom injury or danger – from something bad happening to you. Often we use this w hen we’re actually holding on to another person. “I’ve got you. Don’t worry. Y ou’re not going to fall.” Christine apologizes. She says, “Sorry, I have a fe ar of heights” (heights). A “fear of heights” is when you are afraid of being far abo ve the ground. Some people, for example, don’t like to go up in a tall building  and look out because they have a “fear of heights.” They’re afraid even when there  is no danger of them falling down.

Christine says, “I sometimes have panic attacks whe n I am high up off the ground.” A “panic (panic) attack” is a sudden feeli ng of fear and anxiety, often without any logical or rational explanation. A pani c attack makes it difficult for a person to behave normally. Christine says she gets panic attacks when she is “high up off the ground” – that is, when she is in the air or on a raised surface, when she is perhaps on a ladder or on the top of the roof of a house or just high up in a building. If she’s “high up off the ground, ” she has panic attacks.

Asahi says, “Okay, but we’re not very high up,” mea ning we are not very far from the ground. Christine says, “I know. My phobia is t otally irrational.” If something is “irrational” (irrational), it is not rational, it is not logical. It cannot be explained in any logical or reasonable way. A “phobia” (phobia) is normally a fear of something. If you have a phobia of something, you h ave an irrational fear of something.

Just because you are afraid of something, however, doesn’t mean it’s a phobia. It doesn’t mean it’s irrational. I have a fear of some one who has a gun killing me. That’s not an irrational fear if the person is poin ting the gun at you, if the person

is aiming the gun in your direction. A phobia is so mething that would be irrational – something you have no good reason to fear.

Asahi says, “That explains a lot, like why you live  on the ground floor of your apartment building.” The “ground (ground) floor” is  what we call in the United States also the “first floor.” It’s the floor or le vel of a building that you can walk into without going up any stairs or steps. That’s c alled the “ground floor” or the “first floor.” In other countries, the first floor is what we would call in the U.S. the “second floor.” That’s the floor that you get to by  going up steps or one set of stairs – “one flight of stairs,” we would say.

But in any case, Asahi understands now why Christin e lives on the ground floor of her apartment building: because she’s afraid of heights. He also understands why she didn’t go “hiking near the cliffs.” “To go hiking” (hiking) means to go walking outdoors, outside, usually for a long dista nce. “Cliffs” (cliffs) are very steep, rocky sides of a mountain that go almost str aight up and down. Sometimes next to, say, an ocean there are cliffs. The water has worn away the side so that there is a straight up-and-down surfac e right next to the water. That would be an example of a “cliff.”

Christine says, “That’s right,” meaning yes, that’s  why I don’t live above the ground floor and that’s why I don’t go hiking near cliffs. “I try to avoid any situations that will trigger my fear.” “To trigger”  (trigger) is to cause something else to happen, to cause an event or situation to o ccur. Interestingly enough, we call the part of the gun that you use your finger to fire the gun the “trigger.” The “trigger” of the gun is the part of the gun that is  used to actually cause the bullet to go out of the gun. That’s a “trigger” as a noun.

As a verb, “to trigger” means to cause something el se to happen. You can understand the relationship, however, here between the noun and the verb, because you “trigger” the bullet from leaving the g un by – we use the verb “to pull” – by “pulling the trigger.” Asahi says, “So h ow do you travel? Do you ever fly?” Do you ever go up into an airplane?

Christine says, “The one time I flew in an airplane ” – that is, I went in an airplane up into the air – “I experienced vertigo and I hype rventilated until we landed. “Vertigo” (vertigo) is a feeling of dizziness, that  you’re going to fall over, when you are up for example on a ladder or any tall stru cture. You may have seen the great Alfred Hitchcock movie Vertigo – that’s what it’s called in English, anyway – precisely about a man who gets dizzy when he goes u p high, when he is high above the ground.

Christine says she experienced vertigo when she was  in an airplane, and because of that, she “hyperventilated.” “To hyperve ntilate” (hyperventilate) is to breathe very quickly and uncontrollably, especially  because you are very excited, or perhaps you are under some stress. “To hypervent ilate” can be dangerous, and it’s important if you are hyperventilating to t ry, of course, to breathe normally, to calm down. Christine says she hyperventilated “u ntil we landed” – that is, until the plane went back down onto the ground.

She says, “I was really agitated because I thought I was going to die.” “To be agitated” (agitated) is to be nervous, to be worrie d, or to be very excited but in a bad way. “It wasn’t pretty,” Christine says of her experience on the airplane. That phrase “It wasn’t pretty” doesn’t refer to how good -looking something or someone is; rather, it’s used to describe something that is  very unpleasant or uncomfortable or perhaps even embarrassing. Christi ne says, “That’s why I normally drive or take a train.” She doesn’t fly in  an airplane.

Asahi says, “So I’m guessing no skydiving for you.”  “Skydiving” (skydiving) is the sport of jumping out of an airplane, falling throug h the sky for a short period, and then opening what’s called a “parachute” (parachute ), which is like a large piece of fabric – well, it is a large piece of fabric – that slows you down so that you don’t kill yourself when you hit the ground. That’s  “skydiving,” and some people do that for fun. Not me. Not Christine, either, bec ause of course she’s afraid of heights.

Christine says, “Not unless you want to find out ho w my stomach reacts to heights.” “To react (react) to” something is to res pond to something. It’s how you behave or something behaves in a certain situation.  Christine is making a joke here. She’s saying that she would probably get sick  to her stomach if she went skydiving, because of course she’s afraid of height s. I’m not afraid of heights, really. Although I don’t think I would go skydiving  or close to a cliff.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
