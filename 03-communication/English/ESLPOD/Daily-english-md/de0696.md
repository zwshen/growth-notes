You’ll get a complete transcript of everything we say on this podcast, no t just the dialogue, as well as a lot of other good information to help you improve y our English.

This episode is a dialogue about “investments,” tak ing your money and putting it somewhere so that you can make more money.  Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Karen:  My company offers a 401(k) plan.  Do you th ink I should have one?

Jimmy:  Yes, definitely.  I had a 401(k) account wh en I worked for McQ Corp, and when I started working on my own I converted it to an IRA.

Karen:  I really don’t understand any of these inve stment options.  I talked to an investment specialist at my bank, but I left her of fice just as confused as when I went in.

Jimmy:  Look, you want to have a diversified portfo lio of lower-risk and higher- risk investments.  On the low-risk end, put money i n bonds, CDs, or a money market account.  You want to balance that out with some riskier investments that may bring a higher return, such as mutual funds and  stocks.

Karen:  Wow, all of that just went over my head.  I  don’t know a CD from a bond.

Jimmy:  It’s really simple.  Your choice ranges fro m a fixed return to a variable return, and the variable investments carry differen t levels of risk.

Karen:  My head hurts.  Are you sure I really need all of these investments?

Jimmy:  Not all of them, but it would be smart to i nvest your money in something.

Karen:  Not if I spend it all first, right?

Jimmy:  Right.  You know what they say: “A fool and  his money are soon parted!”

Our dialogue begins with Karen saying to Jimmy, “My  company offers a 401(k) plan.  Do you think I should have one?”  A “401(k)”  is the name the government gives a certain kind of retirement savings plan.  I t helps people save money by allowing the company to take money out of your week ly or monthly paycheck and put it into some sort of investment, typically some  sort of stock investment.  The advantage of the traditional 401(k) plan is that yo u don’t have to pay taxes on the money that you put into the account until you retir e.  That’s the traditional 401(k). It’s a plan that’s offer by private businesses, typ ically.  Government organizations have somewhat different plan names, but they have t he same function – they do the same thing.

Jimmy says to Karen, “Yes, definitely.  I had a 401 (k) account when I worked for McQ Corp (McQ Corporation, the name of the company) , and when I started working on my own I converted it to an IRA.”  An “I RA” is another kind of retirement savings account; this helps you save mon ey.  It’s something that you open, not your employer.  The 401(k) is something t hat the person or the company you work for operates.  An IRA is something  that you can open on your own, and there are different kinds of individual re tirement accounts.

Karen says, “I really don’t understand any of these  investment options.” “Investment” is when you use your money to make mor e money by buying stocks, or buying a building or a house, or part of  a business, and so forth. Karen says, “I talked to an investment specialist  (someone who’s an expert) at my bank, but I left her office just as confused as when I went in,” meaning she went to talk to the person but she was still unclea r; she was confused after she talked to her.

Jimmy says, “Look (meaning pay attention to what I’ m going to say), you want to have a diversified portfolio of lower-risk and high er-risk investments.” “Diversified” means it has a lot of different thing s in them, they’re not all the same.  A “portfolio” here means all of the investme nts that you own, especially stock investments.  So, a “diversified portfolio” i s one where you own a lot of different kinds of stocks.  Jimmy says you should o wn low- or lower-risk and high- or higher-risk investments.  “On the low-risk  end,” meaning some of the low-risk options, the ones that are not going to be  likely to lose you any money but you probably won’t gain a lot of money either, are bonds, CDs, and money

market account.  “Bonds” are basically an agreement  between a company or a government and you to give you a certain amount of money with interest after a certain number of years.  There are “short-term” bo nds, bonds that only last a few months or a few years; there are “long-term” bo nds that could last 15 or 20 years.  In both cases, you give the company – you l end the company, essentially, some money and the company pays you back with inter est at the end.  “CDs” stand for certificate of deposit.  That is similar,  but here you give your money to a bank, and the bank keeps your money for a certain a mount of time – six months, a year, two years – and at the end of that time the y give your money back with interest.  So, you’re kind of loaning your money to  the bank, and the bank is paying you for that loan by giving you interest on your CD.  CDs are very safe investments; you don’t make a lot of money, but you  probably won’t lose your money either.  A “money market” is perhaps the safe st kind of investment – the least risky investment.  That’s basically a checkin g account with your bank, and they give you interest – they pay you money for kee ping your money in the bank. So, we have bonds and CDs and money markets; these are low-risk investments.

Jimmy says, “You want to balance that out with some  riskier investments that may bring a higher return, such as mutual funds and  stocks.”  “To balance (something) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to keep a balance, to keep things even.  We sometimes talk about eating a balanced me al or having a balanced diet.  You should have some vegetables, some grains , some fruit, perhaps some meat, some fish, some candy – that’s a big part of a balanced diet, eating a lot of candy!  Well, this is a balanced portfolio, so if y ou have low-risk investments then you should have something on the other end, high-ri sk investments; that’s to balance things out.  You want a riskier investment in order to get a higher return. “Return,” when we’re talking about stocks and inves tments, is the percentage of money that you make or earn on your investment.  If  I give the bank 100 dollars and at the end of 6 months the bank gives me 105 do llars, with 5 dollars in interest, my return was 5 percent.  So, all investm ents have a return; sometimes you lose money, of course.  High-risk investments u sually have higher returns, but it’s also more likely that you will lose money.   So in order to get the higher return, you have to take more of a risk.  “Return” has a number of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for some additional explanations.

Some higher-risk investments include mutual funds a nd stocks.  Let’s start with “stocks.”  “Stocks” are partial ownership of a comp any.  That is, if you buy, for example, Apple stock or Microsoft stock, you own a little bit of that company.  So if the company does well, you will probably make mo ney.  “Stocks” are also sometimes called “shares” (shares).  A “mutual fund ” is typically a collection of

different kinds of stocks.  Usually you have many i nvestors who give money to a company that owns the mutual fund, and they buy a l ot of different kinds of stocks or a lot of different kinds of investments.  So, it’s something where you’re not buying the individual stock directly; you’re bu ying ownership in this mutual fund, and the fund will then go out and buy the sto cks or bonds or whatever investment they are investing in.

Karen says, “Wow, all of that just went over my hea d.”  “To go over your head” here means not to understand what the person is tal king about, usually because it’s very complicated and you don’t have much exper ience in it.  Karen says, “I don’t know a CD from a bond.”  This general express ion, “I don’t know (something) from (something else),” means you can’t  recognize the difference or don’t know the difference between these two things.   The opposite would be “to know (something) from (something else),” and that w ould be to understand the differences, but Karen doesn’t.

Jimmy says, “It’s really simple.  Your choice range s from a fixed return to a variable return, and the variable investments (or v ariable return investments) carry different levels of risk (or have different l evels of risk).”  “Ranges,” for something to range from something to something else , means that these are the maximum and minimum, or this is the difference in v alue from the low end to the high end.  In this case, the investment ranges from  fixed returns to variable returns.  “Fixed” here means it doesn’t change, it has a constant value.  The banks says that they will give you five percent int erest on your CD.  That’s not going to change; it’s not going to go up, it’s not going to go down.  For stocks and mutual funds and other variable return investments,  it could go up or it could go down.  “Variable” means changing; the value changes  over time.  The word “fixed” has a couple of other meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more information.

Karen says, “My head hurts.”  That’s kind of a funn y expression to mean this is so much information or difficult information to und erstand, I can’t understand it all.  She says, “Are you sure I really need all of these investments?”  Jimmy says, “Not all of them, but it would be smart to invest y our money in something.”  Karen says, “Not if I spend it all first, right?”  She’s making another joke; she’s saying, “Well, I don’t have to invest my money if I spend i t.”  Of course, if you spend it then you won’t have money in the future.  This is o ne of the great lessons in life that one must learn as you grow older, and some peo ple never learn that if you don’t save something today you won’t have anything tomorrow.

Karen is joking by saying that she doesn’t have to invest if she spends all of her money now.  Jimmy says, “Right,” meaning that’s rig ht, that’s correct.  Then he

uses an old expression: “A fool and his money are s oon parted.”  A “fool” is an idiot, a stupid person, an unwise person.  If you h ave a stupid person, usually or often they will lose their money.  “To be parted” m eans to be separated from.  So, the money and the fool are separated because the fo ol loses his money.  So, “a fool and his money are soon parted” means that peop le who aren’t very smart usually lose their money; they spend it or someone takes it from them in some fashion – in some way.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
