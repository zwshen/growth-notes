Consider yourself lucky! Consider yourself lucky to be still breathing and having 
fun participating in this
contest. But we apprehend that many of your descendants may not have this luxury. 
For, as you know, we
are the dwellers of one of the most polluted cities on earth. Pollution is everywhere, 
both in the environment
and in society and our lack of consciousness is simply aggravating the situation.

<P>
However, for the time being, we will consider only one type of pollution ­-
the sound  pollution. The loudness
or intensity level of sound is usually measured in <EM>decibels</EM> and sound
having intensity  level 130 decibels or
higher is considered painful. The intensity level of normal conversation is 60­65 
decibels and that of heavy traffic is 70­80 decibels.

<P>
Consider the following city map where the edges refer to streets and the
nodes refer to crossings. The integer on each edge is the average intensity
level of sound (in decibels) in the corresponding street. 

<P>

<P>
To get from crossing <B>A</B> to crossing <B>G</B> you may follow
the following path: <B>A­C­F­G</B>. In that case you must be capable of
tolerating sound intensity as high as 140 decibels. For the paths <B>
A­B­E­G</B>, <B>A­B­D­G</B> and <B>A­C­F­D­G</B> you must tolerate respectively 90,
120 and 80 decibels of sound intensity. There are other paths, too. However,
it is clear that <B>A­C­F­D­G</B> is the most comfortable path since it does not
demand you to tolerate more than 80 decibels. 

<P>
In this problem, given a city
map you are required to determine the minimum sound intensity level you must
be able to tolerate in order to get from a given crossing to another.

<P>
The input may contain multiple test cases.

<P>
The first line of each test case contains three integers

where <I>C</I> indicates the number of crossings
(crossings are numbered using distinct integers ranging from 1 to <I>C</I>), <I>S</I>
represents the number of streets and <I>Q</I> is the number of queries. 

<P>
Each of the next <I>S</I> lines contains three integers: <I>c</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>c</I><SUB>2</SUB> and <I>d</I>
indicating that the average sound intensity level on the street connecting the
crossings <I>c</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>c</I><SUB>2</SUB> (

is <I>d</I> decibels.  

<P>
Each of the next <I>Q</I>
lines contains two integers <I>c</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>c</I><SUB>2</SUB> (

asking for the minimum
sound intensity level you must be able to tolerate in order to get from
crossing <I>c</I><SUB>1</SUB> to crossing <I>c</I><SUB>2</SUB>. 

<P>
The input will terminate with three zeros
form <I>C</I>, <I>S</I> and <I>Q</I>.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each test case in the input first output
the test case number (starting from 1) as shown in the sample output. Then for
each query in the input print a line giving the minimum sound intensity level
(in decibels) you must be able to tolerate in order to get from the first to
the second crossing in the query. If there exists no path between them just
print the line ``<TT>no path</TT>". 

<P>
Print a blank line between two consecutive test cases.
