This episode is a dialogue between Linda and Bruce about being in a business meeting and making sure you get done what you are s upposed to get done. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Lynda: Could I say one more thing about that? 

Bruce: I’m afraid we’re running short on time. Mayb e we could wrap up this discussion now. 

Lynda: Before we leave this topic, though, I really  think we should talk about next year’s plans. 

Bruce: That’s outside the scope of this meeting. We  can put it on the agenda for next time. 

Lynda: But we won’t meet again for a month. We shou ld spend some time talking about our plans for next year. I think we should co nsider closing the Irvine office and moving it to Franklin. It would save us a lot o f money. 

Bruce: If we get off on a tangent, we won’t be able  to get through our discussion for today. Let’s try to get back on track and discu ss the main focus of today’s meeting, which is how to end this year without any more problems. I feel like we’re getting close to making some decisions. 

Lynda: We can’t make any decisions when there are s till so many unresolved issues. Things are still up in the air because we d on’t know what will happen next year. Any decisions we make now will be moot if our  assumptions are wrong.  

Bruce: I’m afraid we differ on that. I think we hav e enough information now to forge ahead. We can come to some tentative decision s and make any adjustments later. Should we take it to a vote? 

Lynda: If you insist. I still think it’s premature.   

Bruce: I’ll take that as a “no” vote.

Our dialogue begins with Linda asking something. Sh e says, “Could I say one more thing about that?” She wants to say something at this meeting we’re at. Bruce says, however, “I’m afraid we’re running shor t on time.” “To run short on time” means to not have enough time to do something . You are saying that you don’t have very much time – that you have to stop w hatever you are doing very soon.  

Bruce says, “Maybe we could wrap up this discussion  now.” “To wrap (wrap) up” something here means to finish something, to comple te something, to bring something to an end. Bruce doesn’t want to allow Li nda to make another comment. He wants to end the discussion right now. Linda says, however, “Before we leave this topic,” meaning before we sto p talking about this, “I really think we should talk about next year’s plans.”  

Bruce says, however, “That’s outside the scope of t his meeting.” When we say something is “outside the scope” (scope) of somethi ng – in this case, a meeting – we are saying that it is not related to what we are  doing right now or discussing right now. It is irrelevant. It is not relevant. It  is not something we should be doing right now. Bruce says, “We can put it on the agenda  for next time.” An “agenda” (agenda) is a written plan or list of topics that y ou are going to talk about in a meeting.  

Linda says, “But we won’t meet again for a month.” She’s complaining that this committee or this group won’t be meeting again for at least a month. She thinks the group should talk about her topic right now. Sh e says, “We should spend some time talking about our plans for next year. I think we should consider closing the Irvine office and moving it to Franklin . It would save us a lot of money.” So, Linda is making a proposal about closin g one of the company’s offices.  

Bruce is not too happy, I think, about Linda’s comm ent. He says, “If we get off on a tangent, we won’t be able to get through our disc ussion for today.” “To get off  

on a tangent” (tangent), or more commonly “to go of f on a tangent,” means to become distracted from your main topic or your main  purpose – to start talking about something else that isn’t really related to t he main thing you’re supposed to be talking about.  

Bruce thinks that Linda’s topic is not relevant to what the group is talking about right now, that they would go off on a tangent if t hey started talking about her topic. He’s worried the group won’t get through the ir discussion for today. “To get through” something means to finish it – to accompli sh or complete it.  

Bruce then says, “Let’s try to get back on track an d discuss the main focus of today’s meeting.” “To get back on track” (track) me ans to return to what you should be talking about or to return to what you sh ould be doing after you have done something that you shouldn’t have been doing. In other words, if you get distracted and you want to go back to what you are supposed to be doing, you are getting back on track. That’s what Bruce wants to do. He wants to talk about how to end this year without any more problems, not  talk about next year.  

He says, “I feel like we’re getting close to making  some decisions.” Linda, however, is not giving up. She’s not quitting. She says, “We can’t make any decisions when there are still so many unresolved i ssues.” If an issue or a problem is “unresolved” (unresolved), it is not yet  finished or not yet decided. It still needs to be addressed. It still needs to be s olved or talked about. The opposite, of course, would be a “resolved” issue. A  resolved issue is something that you have decided or have made a decision on or  a determination about.  

Linda says that there are too many unresolved issue s to make any decisions. She continues, “Things are still up in the air beca use we don’t know what will happen next year.” If something is “up in the air,”  it is unresolved. It is still not decided or still unknown. If someone asks you where  you’re going on vacation this year and you say, “I don’t know, my plans are still up in the air,” you’re saying that you have not yet made a decision. You don’t kn ow yet.  

Linda says, “Any decisions we make now will be moot  if our assumptions are wrong.” To say something is or will be “moot” (moot ) means that it is debatable or it is too uncertain to be resolved or perhaps reall y to make any difference at all. To say something is, for example, a “moot point,” i s to say that even if what you say is true, it’s not really important. It doesn’t have any real significance for what we’re talking about.  

If, for example, you spend all of your time plannin g on how you’re going to spend a million dollars that you hope to win from a lotte ry, really the discussion is “moot”  

unless you actually win the lottery. It doesn’t hav e any significance. It has no practical meaning or practical application. Linda i s saying that they can’t make any decisions now because “the decisions will be mo ot if our assumptions are wrong.” Your “assumptions” are your beliefs about s omething in the future or about what is true. You don’t necessarily have any evidence or proof, but you think it’s true.  

We often use the verb “to make” with “assumption.” “I’m going to make some assumptions.” I’m going to think about certain situ ations and believe them to be true, or perhaps pretend that they are true in orde r to make some decision or to take some action. Linda is saying that if the assum ptions of the company are wrong, if what they think is true is not true, then  all of the decisions they make will be moot. They’ll have no importance because they’ll  have to make new decisions or make new plans in the future.  

Bruce says, “I’m afraid we differ on that.” “To dif fer” (differ) means to have different beliefs or opinions about something, or s imply to be different in some way from something else. My brother and I differ on  which professional baseball team is the best in California. He thinks it’s the San Francisco Giants. I think it’s the Los Angeles Dodgers. We differ. Of course, I’m right, but I’m just giving a possible example there.  

Bruce says, “I think we have enough information now  to forge ahead.” “To forge (forge) ahead” means to move forward, to continue o n. Bruce says, “We can come to some tentative decisions and make any adjus tments later.” A “tentative” (tentative) – sometimes pronounced without the seco nd “T,” as “tentative” – means to be provisional, to be temporary. In this c ase, it means not final. A tentative decision is a decision you’re making now,  but you might change it in the future.  

Bruce says that they can make some tentative decisi ons now “and make any adjustments later.” An “adjustment” is a change or adaptation of something. Bruce says, “Should we take it to a vote?” meaning “Should we vote on it?” Should each person say whether they like this idea or not?  

Linda says, “If you insist,” meaning if you are dem anding very strongly that we do that. “I still think it’s premature,” she says. Whe n something is “premature” (premature), it happens before it should, or it hap pens too early. When we talk about a premature birth or a premature baby, we’re talking about a baby who is born earlier than would be expected (and this, of c ourse, can sometimes lead to health complications in the baby). Linda thinks it’ s premature to make a decision.  

Bruce says, “I’ll take that as a ‘no’ vote.” He mea ns that Linda is saying that she does not want to vote on the matter right now. She thinks they should continue talking about it. And if you have ever been in a co mmittee meeting, a meeting of a group of people trying to make a decision, you kn ow how difficult it can be to keep the meeting on track, to keep everyone from go ing off on a tangent.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
