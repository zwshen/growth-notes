<H1 align="center">From Databases to XML</H1>
</font>

<P align="justify">
XML is becoming more and more the designated format for information
exchange. As most of the currently stored information resides in
databases, a way to convert it from the relational data model to a XML
format is required.  

<P align="justify">
In this problem we present a transformation rule
suitable for a restricted subset of relational databases, namely 

<UL>
<LI><P align="justify">a database is defined by a set of table headers like
  <code>R(#A, B, C)</code> where <TT>R</TT> is the name of the table, and
  <code>#A</code>, <TT>B</TT> and <TT>C</TT> the names of the columns; 
</LI>
<LI><P align="justify">a column with a name starting by "<code>#</code>" is the key of the
  corresponding table, which is different in every table line and is
  thus used to identify the lines; 
</LI>
<LI><P align="justify"> a column <TT>B</TT> in a table <TT>R</TT>, other than the key, can
either be a simple attribute or a reference to a table <TT>S</TT> if the name
of the column <TT>B</TT> is mentioned in the key <code>#B</code> of table <TT>  S</TT>, meaning that the table <TT>R</TT> depends on table <TT>S0</TT>; 
</LI>
<LI><P align="justify"> there is exactly one table that does not depend on any other; 
</LI>
<LI><P align="justify"> each table contains at most one reference; 
</LI>
<LI><P align="justify"> a table may reference itself; 
</LI>
<LI><P align="justify"> the lines in each table are represented in the
  same form of the 
  table header, but with the specific values for the line instead of
  the names of the columns.  
</LI>
</UL>

<P align="justify">
An example is of a database with three tables, R, S and T, and the
corresponding XML translation is as follows:

<PRE>
-------------------     ------------------------------
|  S(#C,A,D)      |     |  &lt;DB&gt;                |
|  R(#A,B)        |     |  &lt;R #A="a1" B="b1"&gt;  |
|  T(E,A)         |     |  &lt;S #C="c2" D="d3"&gt;  |
|  data           |     |  &lt;/S&gt;                |
|  T(e1,a2)       |     |  &lt;S #C="c3" D="d1"&gt;  |
|  S(c3,a1,d1)    |     |  &lt;/S&gt;                |
|  S(c1,a2,d2)    |     |  &lt;/R&gt;                |
|  S(c2,a1,d3)    |     |  &lt;R #A="a2" B="b2"&gt;  |
|  R(a1,b1)       |     |  &lt;S #C="c1" D="d2"&gt;  |
|  R(a2,b2)       |     |  &lt;/S&gt;                |
-------------------     |  &lt;T E="e1"&gt;          |
                        |  &lt;/T&gt;                |
                        |  &lt;/R&gt;                |
                        |  &lt;/DB&gt;               |
                        ------------------------------

<P align="justify">
The translation to XML is done according to the following rules:

<UL>
<LI>there is a main element called <TT>DB</TT>; 
</LI>
<LI><P align="justify"> an element called <TT>X</TT> starts with a tag
called <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> 
  and ends with a  tag called <code>&lt;/X&gt;</code>;  
</LI>
<LI><P align="justify"> each line in a table <code>R(#A, B)</code> is represented by an
  element called R and the columns which are not references to tables
  are represented by a pair "<TT>column_name=value</TT>" inside the
  opening tag <code>&lt;R #A="a1" B= "b1"&gt; ... &lt;/R&gt;</code>; 
</LI>
<LI><P align="justify">
 columns that are references are not explicitly represented but
  only implicitly by including the element of the corresponding line
  inside the element of the referred line, that is, between the
  opening and closing tags of the element as shown in the example.
</LI>
</UL>

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Problem</H2></FONT>
Given a database dump, produce a XML translation for it according to
the rules above. In case there are several direct sub-elements for the
same element, order them first by the element name itself then by the
first argument, second argument, etc. 

<P align="justify">
In the example above, both <TT>T</TT> and <TT>S</TT> include a reference to
  <TT>R</TT>, via the column <TT>A</TT>. The translations of the <TT>S</TT> and
  <TT>T</TT> data-lines are embedded in the translation for the
  corresponding <TT>R</TT> line, the <TT>S</TT> data-lines before the <TT>  T</TT> data-lines. 

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>
<b>
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.
Consecutive test cases are separated by a single blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>

The input is a sequence of text lines.  The first lines contain table
headers, in no particular order, followed by a line with the word
"<TT>data</TT>" and then the remainin lines, one for each table
data-line.  The input is guaranteed to obey the rules mentioned above,
namely, there is exactly one table header with no references to other
tables and the other tables have at most one reference.  

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>

The output is the corresponding XML translation following the rules
defined above. It should have just one tag in each line, left
justified. Use single spaces to separate attributes inside tags and no
extra spaces, for instance around "=".
