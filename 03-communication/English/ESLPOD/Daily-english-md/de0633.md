[start of dialogue]

[A knock on door.]

Andre:  Hello.  Is anyone here?

Ellie:  Yes, can I help you?

Andre:  I saw your door open and I just wanted to make  sure everything was okay.  Did you just move in?

Ellie:  No, I’m moving out.  As you can see, I’m doing l ast-minute packing.  I think I’ve used up 10 rolls of packing tape!

Andre:  This looks like a major undertaking.  Are you movi ng yourself?

Ellie:  No, the movers are coming with the moving van to morrow morning.  I’m moving a few things into storage, and I’ll take a few of the perishables and essentials in my car, but they’ll be doing the heavy lifti ng.  No loading for me. Before they come, though, I need to disassemble this de sk and this bookcase. It’ll be a long afternoon.

Andre:  I can see that.  Are you moving far?

 Ellie:  No, I’m only moving about a mile from here to  another apartment.

Andre:  Oh, so you’re not moving out of the area.

Ellie:  No, I’m not.

Andre:  I’m glad to hear that.  Let’s make a deal: I ’ll help you disassemble your furniture if you’ll promise to invite me over to your n ew place sometime.

Ellie:  Really?  Are you sure you’re willing to do that ?

Andre:  Sure.  Hand me those tools and I’ll have it d one in no time.

Ellie:  Boy, am I glad I left my door open.

Andre:  Yeah, so am I.

Our dialogue begins with Andre knocking on a door.  He says, “Hello.  Is anyone here?”  Ellie says, “Yes, can I help you?”  Andre says, “I sa w your door open and I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.”  Andre a pparently lives near this house, saw the door open, and for some weird reas on decided to go and find out who was there.  He says, “Did you just move in?”  “To move in” is a two-word phrasal verb that means to begin living in a new place, when you move all of your things to a new apartment or a new house.  Ellie says, “ No, I’m moving out.”  “To move out” is the opposite of “to move in,” it’s when you are leaving a place: your apartment or your house.

Okay, so Andre doesn’t know this woman, and he doesn’t kn ow that she’s been living there, so maybe Andre isn’t from the neighborh ood.  Maybe Andre is a thief – a crook, a criminal.  Let’s find out!

Ellie continues, “As you can see, I’m doing last-minute packing.”  To do anything “at the last minute” means to do it right before the  deadline, right before it has to be done, to wait until there is no more time left.  “To pack” (pack) means to put your things in boxes, in suitcases so you can move them.  So,  “last-minute packing” (“packing” here is a noun) means the process of put ting all your things in boxes to move them at the very last possible opportunity.   Ellie says, “I think I’ve used up 10 rolls of packing tape!”  “To use up” mea ns to complete, to finish,

 to have no more of.  In this case, she’s used up 10 roll s of packing tape. “Packing tape” is wide, thin plastic tape – tape is sticky on  one side – and you use it to close a box to make sure it stays closed.  The ta pe typically comes on a “roll,” that’s a circle that you can then pull the tape  off of.

Andre says, “This looks like a major undertaking.”  Anythin g that is “major” is large or important, big.  An “undertaking” is a task, a  job to do, often a long and difficult one.  So you will often see these words toget her, “a major undertaking,” meaning a big job to do.  “Are you moving yourself?” An dre says, meaning are you doing this alone, is no one helping you.  Of course, we think Andre is interested in stealing her stuff and so, of course, he wants to know if anyone else is coming over.

Ellie, unhappily, says, “No, the movers are coming with the moving van tomorrow morning.”  The “movers” are the people whose job it is to come and help you pack.  You can actually hire people, pay them to come to yo ur house and help you put all your things into boxes if you have a lot of th ings, or perhaps if you’re old and don’t have the strength – or if you’re just lazy!   Ellie is having the movers come over tomorrow with the moving van.  By the way, I sho uld mention “mover” has a couple of different meanings in English, and those  are in the Learning Guide.  A “van” is a large truck that is used usually to m ove things from one place to another.  A “moving van” is usually a large what we w ould call “semi” or “semi truck.”  She says, “I’m moving a few things into storage, a nd I’ll take a few of the perishables and essentials in my car, but they’ll be doing the heavy lifting.” “Storage” is a place where you can keep your boxes and oth er things, perhaps because you don’t have room in your house, perhaps because you are moving to a smaller house, or because you just hate to throw anythi ng away – to get rid of anything – and you have too much stuff.  We all have too  much stuff I think!

Ellie says, “I’ll take a few of the perishables and essenti als in my car.” Something that is “perishable” (perishable) is something , usually food, that you need to keep in a freezer or refrigerator.  If you d on’t, the food will, we would say, go bad; you won’t be able to eat it anymore.  So meat , for example: you can’t keep the meat outside of a refrigerator for two days, t he meat will go bad.  In fact, the recommended amount of time I think is two hours maxi mum.  So, she’s taking these perishable with her.  She’s also taking oth er “essentials,” things that she absolutely must have, things that she can’t wait to use : her toothbrush, or perhaps her favorite pillow.  The movers, however, will be doing the heavy lifting. “To lift” (lift) means to take something very heavy and move it off of the ground or off of a table.  You are picking it up; you are lifti ng it.  So, “heavy lifting” as a noun is when you have a lot of very heavy things – things that w eigh a lot that need to

 be moved.  Sometimes we use this expression just to mean a difficult task, something that is difficult or hard to do.  She says, “ No loading for me.”  “To load” (load) means to put the boxes into the moving van; “to load” is usually use when you are moving or going from one place to another and you are taking things with you.  If you are going to the airport, you will need t o load your luggage – load your suitcases into your car.  She needs to load the boxes i nto the moving van but she’s not going to do it herself, that’s why she says, “ No loading for me.” “Before they come,” she says, “I need to disassemble this de sk and this bookcase.”  “To disassemble” is the opposite of “assemble.”  “To assemble” is to put something together; “to disassemble” is to take someth ing apart.

Ellie says, “It’ll be a long afternoon,” meaning I have  a lot of work to do Andre, what do you want.  Andre says, “I can see that.  Are you moving far?”  Ellie says, “It’s none of your business buddy!”  No, she doesn’t say th at, does she?  No, she says, “No, I’m only moving about a mile from here to ano ther apartment.”  Andre says, “Oh, so you’re not moving out of the area,” meaning  away from this city. She says, “No, I’m not.”  Andre says, “I’m glad to hear t hat.  Let’s make a deal.” “To make a deal” means to reach an agreement with some one, when both people get something out of your agreement.  Well her e’s the agreement: Andre says, “I’ll help you disassemble your furniture (your desk and  bookcase) if you’ll promise to invite me over to your new place sometime.”  Now we see that Andre is not a criminal; he’s someone who is trying to start a romantic relationship with Ellie, you see.  He says, “I’ll disassemble your furniture i f you invite me over,” meaning if you ask me to come to your house for dinner, and Ellie says, “Really? Are you sure you’re willing to do that?”  So Ellie obvi ously likes Andre.  She probably shouldn’t since she has a boyfriend.  Oh, you d idn’t know that?  Yeah, she does!

Andre says, “Sure.  Hand me those tools (meaning give me those tools) and I’ll have it done in no time.”  “Tools” are things that you use to help you do something else.  You could have a hammer, you could have  a screwdriver; those are tools that you would use, perhaps to disassemble somet hing.  Andre says, “I’ll have it done in no time,” meaning very quickly, very soon.  Ellie says, “Boy, am I glad I left my door open so that any strange man  could come in and start talking to me.”  She really just said, “Boy, am I glad I left my door open,” but she meant what I said!  Andre says, not surprisingly, “Yeah, so am I.”  Nice job Andre – if that’s your real name!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
