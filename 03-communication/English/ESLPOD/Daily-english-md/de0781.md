[start of dialogue]

Martin:  Okay, quiet on the set!  What are the extr as doing over there?  They’re not in the scene.

Stephanie:  Sorry, I’ll get them off the set.  Is t his the lighting you wanted for this scene?  If not, I can tell the lighting crew.

Martin:  The lighting is fine, but this staging is all wrong.  And can somebody turn off those sound effects?  We’re not using them in t his scene.

Stephanie:  I’ll get right on that.

Martin:  Where is the cast?

Stephanie:  They’re on break because they thought w e wouldn’t resume shooting until 2:00.

Martin:  That’s great!  I have no cast, the sets are all wrong, I have extras milling around where they shouldn’t be, and where is my scr ipt?

Stephanie:  It’s right here on your chair.  Are you  sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?

Martin:  I wish I had that luxury.  Time is money a nd we’re already way over budget.  I’ll be lucky if I still have the shirt on  my back when this production is over!

Our dialogue begins with Martin saying, “Okay, quie t on the set!”  The “set” (set) is the area where you are making a video or a film or a television show; it’s the area where the actors are standing, what you’re act ually filming.  “Quiet on the set” is a common expression the “director” of the f ilm or the TV show, the person who is in charge of actually making it, says so tha t everyone is quiet when they start filming so that you don’t hear other people t alking when you’re not supposed to.

Martin says, “What are the extras doing over there? ”  An “extra” (extra) is a person who appears in a movie or a TV show, but doe sn’t say anything usually, doesn’t have any what we would call “speaking parts .”  They don’t actually say anything; they’re just there perhaps as part of a c rowd of people.  Here in Los Angeles, there are lots of companies that have extr as, and you can sign up and work as an extra in a movie.  It’s very boring work , I’ve been told, and it doesn’t pay very well.  I know a few people who have done t hat because they needed the money.  Well, a lot of actors try to get their “sta rt,” their beginning in acting, by being an extra, one of these people that just appea r on the screen – that is, in the movie or in the TV show – even though they don’t say anything and you don’t even know who they are.

Martin says that the extras are not in the scene.  The “scene” (scene) is the part of the movie – it could also be talking about a pla y – that shows action in a single place.  So, a movie usually has several different s cenes – several different places that you see the actors and the actresses.  There are a few movies that don’t have more than one or two scenes.  There was a famous movie several years ago called My Dinner with Andre , where the whole movie was just basically two people talking in a restaurant.  Well, most mov ies have several scenes.

Stephanie says, “Sorry, I’ll get them (I’ll get the  extras) off the set,” meaning so that they are no longer where the cameras are filmi ng.  She says, “Is this the lighting you wanted for this scene?  If not, I can tell the lighting crew.”  The “lighting” is the arrangement of the lights on a st age or on a set that allows you, of course, to see the actors.  Especially if you are inside, you need to be able to have lighting so that you can see what’s going on.  The word “crew” (crew) is a general term for a group of people who are working together, usually doing some sort of physical work.  In a movie or a TV show, a “crew” is a group of people who do all of the technical things, not the actors,  not the director, but the people who do the lighting, who actually operate the camer as, and so forth.  This is the crew.

 Martin says, “The lighting is fine, but this stagin g is all wrong.”  “Staging” (staging) is the plan for where the actors are goin g to stand, how they should move around in a particular scene.  By the way, I s hould mention the word “crew,” which we just talked about, has some additi onal meanings as well; those can be found in our Learning Guide.  Martin says, “ can someone turn off those sound effects?”  “Sound effects” are recorded sound s that are added so that you don’t actually have to have a certain thing there.  For example, when we record one of our podcasts and you hear a telephone ringin g at the beginning of the dialogue, that’s a sound effect.  I don’t actually have a telephone here that I make ring; I have a recording of a telephone and I use t hat.  That’s a sound effect. Martin says that they’re not using sound effects in  this scene – in this part of the movie.

Stephanie says, “I’ll get right on that.”  “To get right on (something)” means to do it immediately, to do it right away.  Martin then s ays, “Where is the cast?”  The “cast” (cast) is the group of actors in the movie, everyone who is supposed to be in the movie or in the television show.  They are t he people who are the main actors, not the extras.  Typically, we talk about t he cast, we’re talking about the people who are actually speaking in the movies.  Un less, of course, it’s a silent movie!

Stephanie says the cast is “on break,” they’re taki ng some time to relax, “because they thought we wouldn’t resume shooting u ntil 2:00.”  “To shoot” (shoot) here means to use a camera to record images , to record something with a camera, usually a movie camera.  Sometimes we’ll talk about a shoot related to taking photographs, especially, for example, for a magazine.  If they are models, we might have a shoot.  But here, we’re talking abo ut filming the TV show or the movie.

Martin says, “That’s great!”  But he is not happy w hen he says, “That’s great,” he’s being sarcastic; he’s saying one thing and mea ning another.  He says, “I have no cast, the sets are all wrong, I have extras  milling around where they shouldn’t be, and where is my script?”  Martin says  he has extras milling around. “To mill (mill) around” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to sort of walk around slowly in an area without any reason or without any  particular purpose.  You’re just waiting for something so you’re sort of standi ng, we might say “standing around,” milling around, moving back and forth beca use you don’t have anything else to do.  Martin asks where his script is.  The “script” (script) is the written plan for the play, the TV show, or the movie that tells you what all the actors say and what they do.

Stephanie says, “It’s right here on your chair.  are you sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?”  “To call  it a day” means to stop doing something, to stop working for that day and not to work again until the next day. So maybe you’ve been working very hard in your offi ce, and at 4:00 in the afternoon you say, “I’m going to call it a day.”  I ’m going to stop working now and resume or continue working tomorrow.

Martin says, “I wish I had that luxury,” the luxury  to call it a day.  “Luxury” (luxury) here means something very nice, something pleasant,  something good and pleasurable.  But Martin says he does not have that  luxury; he cannot afford – he doesn’t have the ability to just stop working for t he day.  He says, “Time is money.”  This is an old expression.  “Time is money ” means that you can’t waste your time.  We have to be productive, if we sit aro und and do nothing we’ll be losing money because we’re not taking advantage of the time we have.

“Time is money,” Martin says, “and we’re already wa y over budget.”  “To be way over” means to have spent too much money, or to be more than something.  In this case, they are over budget.  “Budget” (budget)  is the plan for the amount of money you are going to spend on something.  If you are “over budget,” you’re spending more than you planned.  If you are “under budget,” you are spending less than you planned.

Martin says, “I’ll be lucky if I still have the shi rt on my back when this production is over!”  The expression “the shirt on my back” do esn’t mean the actual shirt you are wearing.  It’s a phrase referring to the most t hat you can lose, the maximum amount of money that you might lose.  Of course if you lose all of your money, you may actually lose your clothes; you may have to  sell your clothes to pay the money that you owe someone else.  That’s kind of wh at Martin is saying.  A “production” (production) is usually the word we us e to describe the entire action of making a movie, a play, or a television show.  T he whole activity – the whole thing is called a “production.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Martin:  Okay, quiet on the set!  What are the extr as doing over there?  They’re not in this scene.

Stephanie:  Sorry, I’ll get them off the set.  Is t his the lighting you wanted for this scene?  If not, I can tell the lighting crew.

Martin:  The lighting is fine, but this staging is all wrong.  And can somebody turn off those sound effects?  We’re not using them in t his scene.

Stephanie:  I’ll get right on that.

Martin:  Where is the cast?

Stephanie:  They’re on break because they thought w e wouldn’t resume shooting until 2:00.

Martin:  That’s great!  I have no cast, the sets are all wrong, I have extras milling around where they shouldn’t be, and where’s my scri pt?

Stephanie:  It’s right here on your chair.  Are you  sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?

Martin:  I wish I had that luxury.  Time is money a nd we’re already way over budget.  I’ll be lucky if I still have the shirt on  my back when this production is over!
