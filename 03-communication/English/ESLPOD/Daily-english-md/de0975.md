On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e about cooking food without using any canned food or other ingredients that you  would buy that have been already prepared for you. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Ann: I’m so excited to have the entire family comin g for a visit. For our first family dinner next Friday, I’m making everything from scra tch. I’m pulling out all the stops. 

Walt: But have you ever made anything from scratch?   

Ann: Sure I have, plenty of times. 

Walt: If you say so, but our pantry is full of cann ed foods and jars, and nearly everything we’ve cooked in the past year has been p remixed. Are you sure you’re up to cooking a dinner for 12 from scratch? 

Ann: How hard could it be? I just need to make sure  that the ingredients I buy are fresh, follow the recipes closely, add plenty of fr esh herbs and spices, and multitask.  

Walt: You mean do a juggling act. It’ll take a lot of work and organization to pull this off. 

Ann: I’m up to the challenge. And I have a backup p lan. 

Walt: And that is? 

Ann: Have you ever heard of the raw food movement? 

[end of dialogue] 

Ann begins our dialogue by saying to Walt, “I’m so excited to have the entire family coming for a visit. For our first family din ner next Friday, I’m making everything from scratch.” Ann is excited because he r entire family is coming to visit her, and she wants to cook something for them  for dinner. She wants to make it “from scratch.” That expression, “from scra tch,” means you start with basic ingredients and make everything yourself. You  don’t use anything in a can or anything that has been prepared that you bought in the store.  

So, if you’re going to make vegetable soup, you mak e your own “stock,” which is the liquid for a soup, you prepare the vegetables, and so forth. Ann says, “I’m pulling out all the stops.” “To pull out all the st ops” means to do something in the best way that you can, to do something fully – to d o something that would require a lot of work, but would be the most you could poss ibly do. This term actually comes from organ playing. When you play an organ ve ry loudly, you pull out all of the stops. The stops are parts of the organ that  you can pull out in order to make the organ louder. Well, Ann is pulling out all  the stops to make a big family dinner. 

Walt says, “But have you ever made anything from sc ratch?” Walt doesn’t think Ann has ever prepared a meal from scratch. Ann, how ever, says, “Sure I have, plenty of times” – lots of times. Walt says, “If yo u say so.” That expression, “If you say so,” is used when you really don’t believe what  the other person is telling you, but you don’t want to argue with them. Walt sa ys, “Our pantry is full of canned foods and jars.” A “pantry” (pantry) is a sm all room, usually next to the kitchen, that is used to store food that does not h ave to be kept cold – that does not have to be refrigerated. A “pantry” usually has  “dry goods,” like sugar and flour and salt – things you don’t have to put in a refrigerator.  

A pantry would probably also have “canned food.” “C anned food” is food that comes in a metal container – usually made of metal,  of tin. Canned foods are very popular in the United States for all sorts of things, including soups and vegetables and other kinds of food. Canned foods ar e very convenient because you can buy them and then put them in your pantry a nd use them many weeks, or even months, later. A “jar” (jar) is a glass bot tle that has a top on it, which we call a “lid” (lid). “Jars” are also used for storin g things – for putting things into, including food. 

Walt says, “Nearly everything we’ve cooked in the p ast year” – in the last 12 months – “has been premixed.” “To mix” (mix) is to combine different things together, to put things together. “Premixed” would be food, in this case, that has already been prepared and put together so you don’t  have to do it yourself. Walt says, “Are you sure you’re up to cooking a dinner f or 12 from scratch?” “To be up to” something here means to be ready for something,  to be prepared to do something, to have the energy and the knowledge to do something.  

Usually we use the word “challenge” after this expr ession. “Are you up to the challenge?” “Challenge” is a difficult thing to do.  “Up to” can also be used to mean simply doing something. If someone says, “What  are you up to tonight?” he means “What are you doing tonight? What are your pl ans? What activities are you doing tonight?” “Up to” can also be used when s omeone is perhaps doing something wrong, even illegal. “I think my neighbor  is up to something” – I think that there is something strange going on, maybe eve n criminal. I think that’s true. I really do wonder what my neighbor is up to someti mes. I don’t know. Strange smells. You know what I’m saying?  

Ann says that she is up to cooking a dinner from sc ratch. She says, “How hard could it be?” That question, “How hard could it be? ” is used to indicate that you don’t think it is very difficult. You don’t think i t will be difficult to do this. “How hard could it be to find a beautiful woman in Los Angele s and ask her out on a date?” Well, it’s actually quite easy to find a woman. Get ting her to go on the date – that’s a little more difficult.  

Ann says, “I just need to make sure that the ingred ients I buy are fresh.” “Fresh” (fresh) is an adjective used to describe food that has only recently been prepared or has only recently been taken from where it would  normally be found. For example, a fish that is “fresh” is one that has bee n brought from the lake or the river or the ocean very recently. It’s not a fish t hat was caught four months ago and now they’re bringing it to the store. That woul d not be a fresh fish. If you want fresh fish, you often have to go to the river or the lake or the ocean to buy it, if you want it really fresh, right out of the water .  

We can use this adjective also to describe foods th at are prepared – for example, “fresh bread.” “Fresh bread” would be bread that wa s baked or cooked very recently – maybe this morning or an hour ago. “Ingr edients” are the things you use to make food. So, “fresh ingredients” would be things that you use to prepare your food that are fresh. Ann says she also needs t o “follow the recipes closely.” A “recipe” (recipe) is a list of instructions for c ooking or preparing something.  

“To follow something closely” means to do it very c arefully, to do everything that it says. “Following a recipe closely” would mean do ing everything the recipe says, in the order it says to do it. Ann also wants  to make sure that she uses “plenty” – or a lot – “of fresh herbs and spices.” “Herbs and spices” are small parts of plants, often dried, that have a lot of fl avor in them. We use herbs and spices to give more flavor to the food.  

Ann also says she needs to “multitask” (multitask).  “To multitask” is to do many things at the same time. Walt says, “You mean do a juggling act?” “To juggle” (juggle) is to throw a lot of things up into the ai r and keep them all in the air to prevent them from falling, from dropping to the flo or. However, here when Walt says a “juggling act,” he’s referring to something that is very complex, something that will require doing a lot of things at the same  time. The idea here is that this would be very difficult to do because juggling can be difficult to do.  

Walt says, “It’ll take a lot of work and organizati on to pull this off.” “To pull something off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning t o be able to do something that is very difficult or that is very challenging.  Ann says, however, that she is “up to the challenge.” She is able to do this difficult  thing. “And,” she says, “I have a backup plan.” A “backup (backup) plan” is an altern ative if what you’re doing now doesn’t work. It’s what we might also call “plan B. ” When people say, “I need a plan B,” they mean they need a backup plan. They ne ed a plan to follow if what they are planning on doing goes wrong. That would b e their “plan A,” their original or first plan.  

Walt asks what Ann’s backup plan is. Ann tells him,  “Have you ever heard of the raw food movement?” “Raw” (raw) is the opposite of cooked. If you buy some tomatoes at the supermarket and you bring them home , they’re raw. They haven’t been cooked yet. In the last few years, it has become popular for some restaurants, and people in their homes, to not cook  food – to eat the food raw by preparing it in special ways.  

There are, according to some people, health benefit s from this. I don’t know if that’s true. I do know that Ann is just making a jo ke here. She’s saying that her backup plan is not to cook the food at all and to s erve it, or to give it to her guests, raw. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
