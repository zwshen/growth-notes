This episode is called “Having a Temper Tantrum.”  When someone gets very angry, especially a young child, we often say they have a “ temper tantrum.”  This is a dialogue between Alberto and Melissa using a numbe r of different words you might use to describe this unfortunate situation.  Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alberto:  What was that ear-splitting scream?!

Melissa:  That little girl over there is having a temper  tantrum.

Alberto:  Oh, great!  The movie hasn’t even started an d that kid is already acting up.

Melissa:  I hope she’s okay.  She looks miserable.  Maybe he r parents can distract her somehow.

Alberto:  She’s fine.  She’s just looking for attention  or frustrated she didn’t get what she wanted.  If parents didn’t give in every time their child wanted something, kids wouldn’t throw tantrums.

Melissa:  I don’t know.  When my son was little, he used to throw tantrums when he didn’t know how to tell us what he needed.  He got  frustrated and sometimes, he would start kicking and screaming.

Alberto:  Well, I don’t think that’s the case here.  Lo ok at those parents.  They’re going to buy the girl some candy to quiet her down.  Th at’s just rewarding her for her misbehavior.

 Melissa:  What would you do instead?

Alberto:  I would set limits so that things like this ne ver happened.  In this case, I would give that girl a spanking.  It’s all about having  consequences for bad behavior.

Melissa:  Oh, yeah?  Did that work with your children?

Alberto:  Uh, I don’t have any kids.

Melissa:  That’s what I thought!

We begin with Alberto saying, “What was that ear-splitt ing scream?!”  “To scream” is to yell or shout very loudly.  “Ear-splitting” m eans that it is a very loud sound, perhaps a sound that is very high pitched, like “Ah !”  That would be a high-pitched scream.  That might also be a bird; it’s ha rd to say!  In any case, an ear-splitting scream would be a scream that was very loud,  very high pitched, something that would hurt your ears.  That’s the meanin g of “ear splitting.”  “To split” something means to cut it in half.

Melissa says, “That little girl over there is having a temp er tantrum.”  Your “temper” is how you get mad or don’t get mad.  Usually when we say somebody has a temper, we mean that they get mad very easily – th ey get angry very easily.  A “temper tantrum” is a short period of time when a child loses control of his or her emotions by screaming, crying, perhaps even kicking ; this would be a “temper tantrum.”

Alberto says, “Oh, great!  The movie hasn’t even started  and that kid is already acting up.”  Alberto and Melissa are at a movie theater , and Alberto is complaining that this child is already acting up.  “To a ct up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to do or say things that are inappropriate .  Usually, it’s a verb we use to describe children who are behaving badly, who are  talking or doing something that they shouldn’t be doing.  We use the same  expression, also, to describe things that aren’t working properly.  You might  say, “My computer is acting up,” meaning it’s not working the way it should.  But here, when referring especially to children, it means that they are making noise  or doing things that they shouldn’t be doing.

Melissa says, “I hope she’s okay.  She looks miserable.”  “Miser able” means very unhappy, but also very uncomfortable.  If you are walkin g in the sun and you are

 sweating and it is very uncomfortable, you might say, “I’m miserable.”  Or if you’re listening to me singing and your ears are splittin g, you would say, “I’m miserable.”  Or if you have to listen to my neighbor’s chi ldren screaming, you would be miserable – trust me!

Melissa says, “Maybe her parents can distract her somehow.”  “ To distract (someone)” means to do something to change what that person is thinking about. If you are feeling sad, you might go and see a happy mo vie to distract you, to get you to stop thinking about the bad things.

Alberto says, “She’s fine.  She’s just looking for attent ion or frustrated she didn’t get what she wanted.”  “To look for attention” means to do something to get other people to notice you – to look at you.  Certain people,  adults and children, want other people to pay attention, to look at them, to th ink that they are important, and Alberto is saying that this little girl is just looki ng for attention, doing something so other people will pay attention to her.  Or, he says, perhaps she’s frustrated.  “To be frustrated” means to be upset, to  be mad, to be angry because you cannot do what you want to do, something is preventin g you from doing what you want to do.  Alberto says, “If parents didn’t give in  every time their child wanted something, kids wouldn’t throw tantrums.”  “To g ive in,” here, means to suddenly decide to do what someone is asking you to do.  So  a child says to his mother, “Mom, I want some candy,” and the mother says, “N o,” and the child says, “Mom, I really want some candy,” and the mother says, “ No.  If you keep bothering me you’re going to have to listen to Jeff McQu illan singing.”  But the child continues to say, “Mom, I really want some candy,” and  finally the parent, the mother in this case, gives in.  She says, “Okay, here’s some candy,” that’s to give in.  Alberto also uses the expression “throw tantrums, ” that’s the verb we often use; “he’s throwing a temper tantrum,” meaning having a temper tantrum.

Melissa says, “I don’t know.  When my son was little, he use d to throw tantrums when he didn’t know how to tell us what he needed.  H e got frustrated and sometimes, he would start kicking and screaming.”  “To kick”  means to move your legs in such a way that you try to hit someone or some thing.  “To scream” means to yell.  The expression “kicking and screaming” is use d to describe someone who is out of control, when they don’t want to do something, someone who is behaving very badly, who is acting like a child.

Alberto says, “Well, I don’t think that’s the case here,”  meaning I don’t think that is the situation here, that’s not what is happening.  “ Look at those parents,” he says, “They’re going to buy the girl some candy to quiet he r down.”  “To quiet (someone) down” means to do something so that the perso n is calmer, the person stops screaming and yelling.  Alberto says, “That’s j ust rewarding her for

 her misbehavior.”  “To reward (someone)” means do someth ing nice or give someone something as a way to thank her for doing someth ing that was good. But of course, this girl didn’t do something that was; sh e did something that was bad.  Bad behavior is called “misbehavior.”  Alberto is saying that the parents are rewarding their child for doing something wrong – f or misbehaving, which, of course, will just cause her to misbehave again in the futu re.

Melissa says, “What would you do instead?”  Alberto says, “I would set limits so that things like this never happened.”  “To set limits” m eans to make rules and tell, in this case, the child what they can and cannot d o.  The word “limit” has several different meanings in English; take a look at ou r Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Alberto says, “In this case, I w ould give that girl a spanking.”  “To spank (spank) (someone)” is to hit someone,  usually a child, lightly when they have done something wrong, usually on their bottom (on their butt; on their rear).  A parent would take their han d and hit the child in their buttocks (in their rear) lightly, we hope – not too stro ng, it is a child after all. Spanking is very controversial; some parents believe that yo u should never do that to your child, other parents don’t agree.  Albert o says, “It’s all about having consequences for bad behavior.”  “Consequence” is a result,  something that happens because of something else.  So, Alberto is saying that if the child does something wrong, something bad has to happen to the ch ild; there must be consequences.

Melissa says, “Oh, yeah?  Did that work for your children?”  Alberto says, “Uh, I don’t have any kids (I don’t have any children).”  So he’ s giving advice about how to take care of children even though he doesn’t have an y himself.  Melissa says, “That’s what I thought!” meaning I knew that, I knew that what you were saying was not based on any experience.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
