This episode is a dialog between Liang and Christia n about telling someone that you don't want to do something, telling them “no.” Let's get started. 

[start of dialog] 

Liang:  I have a favor to ask. 

Christian:  Uh oh, what is it? 

Liang:  I’m doing a project for my class in culinar y school and I need a volunteer to taste some of my creations. 

Christian:  Not on your life. 

Liang:  But, why? 

Christian:  You don’t remember the last time I was your guinea pig?  I was sick for two days. 

Liang:  That was a stroke of bad luck.  Come on, pl ease. 

Christian:  Count me out.  No amount of pleading is  going to change my mind.  I bet I’m not the first person you’ve asked. 

Liang:  Well, no. 

Christian:  Who else has turned you down? 

Liang:  Jacob said no. 

Christian:  I bet he said something stronger than n o.  

 Liang:  He said that he would let me cook food for him over his dead body. 

Christian:  That’s what I thought.  Did you ask Mel e, too? 

Liang:  Yes, and she said she’d rather not. 

Christian:  Who’s next on your list of victims, I m ean candidates? 

Liang:  You’re my last resort.  If you won’t do it,  then I’m sunk.   

Christian:  The answer is still no, but I know some one who won’t turn up his nose at your cooking. 

Liang:  Who? 

Christian:  Come here, Fido!

Liang says to Christian, at the beginning of our di alogue, “I have a favor to ask.” I have something I want you to do for me. Christian s ays, “Uh oh, what is it?” “Uh oh” is an expression that we use when we believe so mething bad is going to happen. In this case, Christian isn't sure what Lia ng is going to ask him. He's a little afraid. Liang says “I'm doing a project for my class in culinary school and I need a volunteer to taste some of my creations.” A “project” is an assignment, something the teacher told them to do. “Culinary (c ulinary) school” is a school that teaches people how to cook, how to become a ch ef. Liang needs a volunteer – someone who will do it willingly – to taste some of her creations. “Creation” is normally something that you make. It’s sometimes us ed by artists. Here it's being used by Liang to talk about the food that she is go ing to prepare.  

Christian says, “Not on your life.” “Not on your li fe” means “no way.” It's a phrase we use to say very strongly that you are not going to do something or something is not going to happen. Liang says, “But why?” Chri stian says, “You don't remember the last time I was your guinea pig?” A “g uinea pig” is literally a small animal, like a hamster. However, in English we use it to mean someone who is asked to try something to see what will happen, som eone who is being used in an experiment. You're not really sure what's going to happen. This is probably because guinea pigs were used in medical experiment s – and perhaps still are, I don't know. But the expression “to be a guinea pig”  means to be someone who is being experimented on, perhaps something that might  be dangerous or  

something that might hurt you. Christian says, “I w as sick for two days.” The last time he was Liang's guinea pig, he was sick for two  days. 

Christian isn't very interested in helping Liang. L iang says, however, “That was a stroke of bad luck.” A “stroke of bad luck” means i t was a negative experience but it probably won't happen again. It was just bad  luck. It was just an accident. It was something that happened that will probably not happen again. She then says, “Come on, please.” “Come on” is often used in  English to get someone to agree with you or to go with you. In this case, Lia ng wants Christian to agree to taste her creations. Christian says, “Count me out. ” This is another way of saying “no.” “Count me out” means don't include me in that  activity. I don't want to participate. Christian says, “No amount of pleading  is going to change my mind.”  

“To plead” (plead) means to beg someone, to ask the m repeatedly, perhaps in a somewhat sad way. Your children might plead with yo u to buy them an ice cream cone or take them to the circus or a carnival, “Oh Dad, please, please, I really want to go, Dad.” That was me when I was younger. W ell, Christian says, “No amount of pleading is going to change my mind.” “No  amount of” is a phrase we use to emphasize that this thing is not going to ha ppen. It doesn't matter what the other person says. So, we put those two together “n o amount” and “pleading,” and we get the idea here that it doesn't matter wha t Liang says or how much she pleads with Christian. He's not going to change his  mind. He's not going to change his opinion, change his decision.  

Christian says, “I bet I'm not the first person you ’ve asked,” Christian knows that Liang has gone and asked some of her other friends perhaps, to do what she wants them to do and they probably said “no” too. L iang says, “Well, no…” – no, you're not the first person I've asked.  

Christian says, “Who else has turned you down?” “Wh o else” means what other person. “To turn someone down” is a two-word phrasa l verb meaning to say no to someone’s request. Someone asks you to do someth ing and you say “no.” The President of the United States asked me to beco me an ambassador, an official representative of the United States, but I  turned him down. I said “No, Mr. President, I'm very busy here doing ESL Podcast, mu ch more important than anything you have for me.”  

Christian wants to know who else has turned Liang d own. Liang says “Jacob said no.” Christian says, “I bet he said something stron ger than no.” “To say something stronger than no” means to say something with more emphasis, not just to say, “Oh no, thank you,” but to say somethi ng that would really indicate that he didn't want to do it. Liang says, “He said that he would let me cook food  

for him over his dead body.” That's a popular expre ssion – “to do something over my dead body” or “over his dead body.” The idea is that you will not let this happen. You will not allow this to happen under any  situation, under any circumstances. I would have to be dead before I all ow that. In other words, I would die rather than allow you to do that. So, it' s a very strong way of saying “No, I'm not going to permit this.” I'm not going t o allow this. I'm not going to say yes to this. 

Christian says, “That's what I thought. Did you ask  Mele, too?” Liang says, “Yes, and she said she'd rather not.” “Rather not” is a p olite way of saying “no,” when someone asks you to do something. Someone says, “Wo uld you go to the movie with me?” And you say, “Well, I'd rather not. I'm k ind of tired.” It's a more polite way of saying no.”  

Christian then asks, “Who's next on your list of vi ctims. I mean, candidates.” A “victim” (victim) is a person who suffers because o f some sort of crime or disease or bad situation – that would be a victim. Christia n also uses the word “candidate.” A “candidate” is someone who's being c onsidered for a job or for a position, something positive, some sort of opportun ity. A candidate could also be someone who wants to be elected to a government pos ition. Christian says, “Who's next” – who's the next person – “on your lis t of victims, I mean, candidates.” He's making a joke. When you want to s ay something bad about someone or criticize something, you may use this fo rm of criticism, or of making a joke that has some sort of criticism in it. For e xample, you're talking to your neighbor and the neighbor has a big dog. It's a hug e dog and you’re a little afraid of it. So, you may say, “So, John how is your lion,  I mean, dog?” A lion, of course, is a big, mean, ferocious animal. You are c omparing the dog to a lion and so you call it a dog, and then you act like it was a mistake. “Oh, I mean” – I meant to say, what I should have said was – “a dog. ” That's how we use that particular structure.  

Christian says, “Who's next on your list of victims , I mean, candidates?” Liang says, “You're my last resort.” “To be the last reso rt” (resort) means you're the only remaining option, the only possibility left. L iang says, “If you won't do it” – if you will not do it – “then I'm sunk.” “To be sunk” (sunk) means that you are in a very difficult situation, a situation in which you will probably not succeed, in which you will probably fail.  

Christian says, “The answer is still no,” meaning h e is not going to do it, “but I know someone who won't turn up his nose at your coo king.” The expression “to turn up your nose at something,” means that you are  going to say no to something because you think you're too good for tha t offer, that what the person  

is offering you is not good enough. “I offered him a thousand dollars to come and fix my car and he turned his nose up at my offer. H e thought that was too low.” It wasn't good enough for him.  

More commonly, we use this expression when someone thinks their new better than another person. So, she said no to the man at the bar. She turned his nose up at his offer to go dancing. She thought she was too beautiful for him. That would be a more common use of that expression.  

Well, Christian knows someone who will not turn his  nose up at the cooking of Liang. Liang says, “Who?” Christian then says, “Com e here, Fido.” “Fido” (Fido) used to be a common name for a male dog. What of co urse Christian is saying is that his dog will eat Liang's food, but he won't. T hat's not a very nice thing for Christian to say. I feel sorry for poor Liang. “I f eel sorry for her” means I feel badly for her. I hope she finds someone to taste he r cooking. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
