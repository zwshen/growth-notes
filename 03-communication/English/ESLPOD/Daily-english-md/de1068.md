This episode is a dialogue about a business that ha s to renew or sign a new contract or lease for a place that they rent. Let’s  get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jane: Our lease is up at the end of this year and w e need to negotiate a new one.

Monty: I know, but if I bring it up first, the land lord will think I’m desperate to renew.

Jane: We are desperate to renew. We’ve built our bu siness here, and it would be really difficult to uproot it and reestablish it el sewhere.

Monty: I know, but given our antagonistic dealings in the past, I’m afraid the landlord is going to jack up our rent and we’ll be forced out.

Jane: It’s in the best interest of the landlord to keep a steady business leasing his property.

Monty: He might not see it that way. He might see t his as an opportunity to bring in a higher-paying tenant.

Jane: Or he may realize that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

Monty: Or he might think, “Out with the old and in with the new.”

Jane: You won’t know until you contact him.

Monty: Right, but I think I’ll let him stew just a little longer.

Jane begins our dialogue by saying to Monty, “Our l ease is up at the end of this year.” Your “lease” (lease) is your contract that d eals with something that you are renting. You could lease a car, for example. You co uld lease a house. You could lease an apartment. You could lease an office. All of these are things that you can sign a contract about and use if you pay the pe rson who owns those things some money.

So, when you lease an apartment, you are renting an  apartment. When you lease a car, you are basically renting the car, but  we don’t use the verb “rent” (rent) for cars. We usually use the word “lease.” F or a business, you can use either rent or lease. These are verbs that indicate  that you are paying money to use something. “Lease” is also a noun referring to the contract itself, the legal agreement that you and the owner sign regarding the  property or the thing that you are renting.

Jane says that their “lease is up.” When we say som ething is “up,” we mean it’s expired, it’s ended – it’s at the end of some perio d of time. In fact, in school sometimes teachers will say, “Time’s up” or “Your t ime is up” when they are giving an examination, a test, to their students. T eachers will tell their students, “Time’s up,” meaning you can no longer work on the test or the exam.

Well here, we’re talking about a lease that is up, meaning it is about to “expire” (expire). “To expire” means to end, in this case. “ To expire” can also mean to die, informally. People say, “He expired.” The nicer way  of saying that someone died is that he “passed away.” Here, we’re not talking a bout a person, but a lease that has expired.

Jane says, “We need to negotiate a new one,” meanin g a new lease. “To negotiate” means to try to reach an agreement with someone, usually over something involving money or something of value. Yo u could negotiate an agreement between two countries, for example. An ag reement between two countries is usually called a “treaty” (treaty). He re, we’re talking about negotiating a lease.

Monty says, “I know, but if I bring it up first, the landlord will think I’m desperate to renew.” Monty is worried about bringing something u p. “To bring something up” here means to mention something that the other pers on hasn’t talked about yet – to raise an issue or to introduce a new topic that the other person hasn’t been

talking about or hasn’t referred to yet. Sometimes people will say, “I hate to bring this up,” meaning I hate to mention this because it ’s perhaps something unpleasant.

But to bring something up doesn’t mean that it’s un pleasant, that it’s something that’s going to cause a problem. You can bring up a nything as a topic of conversation, whether it’s positive or negative. Mo nty, however, is worried about bringing up the topic of the lease renewal because he thinks the landlord will think he’s “desperate to renew.” A “landlord” (land lord) is a person who owns a building, office, home, condominium, or apartment a nd who rents that property out to another person – who leases the property to another person.

The landlord will think that Monty is “desperate to  renew” if Monty brings up the topic first. “To be desperate” (desperate) is to be  in a difficult situation, a difficult problem with very few options, with very few choice s. Someone who is desperate is someone who is in a lot of trouble and doesn’t k now what to do or doesn’t have many options in terms of getting out of the trouble  that he’s in. Monty doesn’t want to seem “desperate to renew” his lease. “To re new” means to sign a new lease, to extend the period of time of the rental o r of the lease.

Jane says, “We are desperate to renew. We’ve built our business here, and it would be really difficult to uproot it and reestabl ish it elsewhere. Jane is saying, well, we are desperate; we really do want to renew the lease. The word “desperate” is sometimes used, as it is here, to me an not exactly that you have no options, but that you really, really want a cert ain thing to happen.

Jane really wants them to renew their lease because  they have built a business at this particular location. They may have a store or a restaurant, and it made have been there for many years, so they don’t want to move it somewhere else. They want to stay there. They’ve built their busine ss there. She says it would be “difficult to uproot it.” “To uproot” (uproot) mean s to move from one place to another, especially from somewhere where you are co mfortable and want to stay.

Monty says, “I know” – I understand – “but given ou r antagonistic dealings in the past, I’m afraid the landlord is going to jack up o ur rent and we’ll be forced out.” “Antagonistic (antagonistic) dealings (dealings)” a re interactions or conversations with another person that are negative or that invol ve some sort of strong disagreement. If you fight a lot with another perso n, you are “antagonistic” toward that person. You don’t like them.

“Dealings” has to do with conversations – or “inter actions,” we would also say – between one person and another. So, if you have “an tagonistic dealings” with, say, the landlord, you have had a lot of disagreeme nts and arguments in the past. We would use this expression, “antagonistic d ealings,” when we are talking about a work situation or a business situation like  this.

Monty is afraid the landlord is going to “jack up the rent.” “To jack (jack) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to increase, but to i ncrease dramatically – to increase something a lot. If the landlord jacks up your rent, he or she increases it by a significant amount. You were paying $500 a mon th, and now you’re going to pay a thousand dollars a month. That would be jacki ng up your rent a lot, significantly. The “rent” here, as a noun, refers to the money that you pay every month or every year to lease the property.

“To be forced out” is a phrasal verb meaning to hav e to leave somewhere even though you want to stay. If a landlord forces out a  person renting from him, he’s making that person leave even though the person doe sn’t want to leave. The person who rents from a landlord, by the way, is ca lled a “tenant” (tenant). You will come across that word in a second.

Jane says, “It’s in the best interest of the landlo rd to keep a steady business leasing his property.” If you say something is “in the best interest” of someone, you mean that it’s a good situation for that person . It benefits that person. In this case, it is in the best interest of the landlord – meaning it would be a good thing for the landlord – to keep a steady business leasin g his property. “Steady” (steady) means without changing. If you have a “ste ady customer,” you have a customer who always comes back to your store, every  week or every month.

A “steady tenant” would be someone who leases from a landlord for a long period of time. All landlords know that it’s better  to have someone paying you some money for your property than no money, and so landlords like to keep tenants as long as they can, so at least they are g etting money. Monty says, however, that the landlord “might not see it that w ay,” meaning the landlord may not necessarily have the same opinion of the situat ion. He says, “He might see this as an opportunity to bring in a higher-paying tenant,” someone who will give him even more money.

Jane disagrees. She says, “Or he” (again, the landl ord) “may realize that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” This is an old expression: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush” (bush). The word “bush” h ere doesn’t refer to one of our former U.S. presidents. It refers to a small shrub.  It’s like a plant, but it’s a plant that has a lot of branches and leaves on it, typica lly.

 The expression “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush” means it’s better to keep something that you have and you know for sure will give you some benefit than to try to get something new with the possibili ty that you won’t get anything better if you give up what you already have. Let me  give you an example.

Let’s say that you are working at a job, and you are making $20 an hour. You have an opportunity to leave that job and get anoth er job that will pay you $30 an hour. However, you might not get the job. You have to quit your first job in order to apply for the second job. So, you would have to lose your job, your certain $20 an hour, for the possibility of getting a better jo b, but it might not work out. You might not get the job. And so if that happens, you would be without any money.

“A bird in the hand” – meaning if you’re holding a bird in your hand – that’s worth more than two birds that are sitting over there tha t you don’t have. Of course, to get the two birds, you have to let go of the bird in your hand and run over and try to grab the other two birds with your hands. So, th at’s kind of the background of that rather complicated expression.

Monty comes back with another expression. He says, “Out with the old and in with the new.” This is another common saying or exp ression. It means to get rid of the old things in your life and bring in new thi ngs in your life because the new things will be better or more exciting. Jane says, “You won’t know until you contact him.” Jane is telling Monty that he won’t k now the real situation until he actually talks to the landlord.

Monty says, “Right” – meaning yes, I understand, yo u are correct – “but I think I’ll let him stew just a little longer.” The verb “to st ew” (stew) means to think and worry about something, especially without telling a nyone else that you are worried about it or that you are thinking about it.  It’s a negative thing.

If someone says, “I’ve been stewing all day over my  presentation,” he means he’s been thinking about this all day, but he hasn’ t talked to anyone else. He hasn’t gotten any help from anyone else. He’s just been there thinking and worrying about it. Usually if you stew about someth ing, the idea is that you’re worrying about it, but you’re not really helping yo urself. You’re wasting your time thinking about it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
