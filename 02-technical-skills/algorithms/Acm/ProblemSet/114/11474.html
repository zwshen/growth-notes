      <p align="justify"><br><font face="Calibri">Once upon the time in the forest, there were 
        lots of trees who were all friends to one another. One of the trees T was very 
        sick. She needed a tree doctor to save her life. As you may already know, trees 
        can't move, but what you probably didn't know is that they can talk. Each tree 
        t1 can talk to tree t2 if the minimum distance between any two branches from 
        each 
        is less than or equal to some value <span class="style10">k</span>. All trees decided to help their sick 
        friend by trying to reach a doctor tree. They will continue to tell one another 
        that tree T is sick until some tree S finds a tree doctor (who is at distance <span class="style10">d</span>      or less from any branch of tree S). S will tell the doctor about her friend so he can go help 
        her.</font></p>
