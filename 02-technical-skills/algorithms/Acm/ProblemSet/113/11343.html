<p>You're given n segments in the rectangular coordinate system. The segments
are defined by start and end points (X<sub>i</sub>,Y<sub>i</sub>) and
(X<sub>j</sub>,Y<sub>j</sub>)  (1 &#60= i, j &#60= n). Coordinates of these
points are integer numbers with real value smaller then 1000. Length of each
segment is positive. </p>

<p> When 2 segments don't have a common point then it is said that segments don't
collide. In any other case segments collide. Be aware that segments collide
even if they have only one point in common.</p>

<p>Segment is said to be isolated if it doesn't collide with all the other segments
that are given, i.e. segment i is isolated when for each 1 &#60= j &#60= n,
(i != j), segments i and j don`t collide. You are asked to find number
T - how many segments are isolated.</p>
	
<p><h4>INPUT:</h4>
First line of input contains number N (N &#60= 50), then tests follow. First line
of each test case contains number M (M &#60= 100) - the number of segments for this test
case to be considered. For this particular test case M lines follow each
containing a description of one segment. Segment is described by 2 points:
start point (X<sub>pi</sub>,Y<sub>pi</sub>) and end point (X<sub>ei</sub>,Y<sub>ei</sub>). They are given in such order:
X<sub>pi</sub> Y<sub>pi</sub>  X<sub>ei</sub> Y<sub>ei</sub></p>
    
<p><h4>OUTPUT:</h4>
For each test case output one line containing number T.</p>
