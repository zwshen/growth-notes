[start of dialogue]

Reservation agent: Hello, Milton Hotel reservations . How may I assist you?

Sally: Hi, I’m calling to make some changes to an e xisting reservation.

Reservation agent: Certainly. Do you have the reser vation number?

Sally: Sure, it’s 234678.

Reservation agent: That’s a reservation for Sally M enkel. Is that right?

Sally: Yes, that’s right. I’d like to change the ch eck-in date from September 15th to September 16th.

Reservation agent: Certainly. I can make that chang e for you. Is that the only change?

Sally: No, the check-out date will also change, fro m the 23rd to the 24th.

Reservation agent: No problem. We have you arriving  on the 16th of September and departing the 24th of September. Will there be anything else?

Sally: Yes, there will be two people in my party, n ot just one.

Reservation agent: I’ve made that change. Anything else I can help you with?

 Sally: Yes, instead of a courtyard room, I’d like a  room with a view, preferably on an upper floor.

Reservation agent: I can certainly change that for you, although there will be a change in the room rate. The new rate is $189 per n ight.

Sally: On second thought, I’d prefer a suite that o verlooks the pool. Is that possible?

Reservation agent: Certainly. The new rate is $249 per night.

Sally: Oh, that’s really expensive. I think I’d bet ter to stick to my original room.

Reservation agent: All right. I’ve changed your res ervation back to a courtyard room. Anything else?

Sally: Maybe I should shorten my stay. If I do that , I could afford a suite. Yes, let’s change the dates and the rooms again.

Reservation agent: Let me make a suggestion. Let’s cancel this reservation and make a whole new one. That way, we can make sure ev erything is correct.

Sally: Oh, that’s not too much trouble for you, is it? I’d hate to be a bother.

Reservation agent: No, no trouble at all.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the “reservation agent” – the employee at the hotel who is in charge of taking reservations – answering the  phone by saying, “Hello, Milton Hotel reservations. How may I assist you?” “ Reservations” refer to calling up a hotel, or perhaps a restaurant, and telling the business that you want to reserve – you want for them to save for you – a roo m if it’s a hotel, or a table for dinner if it’s a restaurant.

“Reservations,” plural, is sometimes also used to d escribe the department or the office that is in charge of taking reservations, es pecially for a hotel or perhaps a rental car company. The reservation agent or employ ee says, “How may I assist you?” “To assist” means the same as “to help.” Sall y says, “Hi, I’m calling to make some changes to an existing reservation.” Sall y already has a reservation;

that’s why she refers to it as an “existing (existi ng) reservation” – one that is already in place.

The agent says, “Certainly. Do you have the reserva tion number?” Many businesses that take reservations give people a num ber that is used to help the business find that specific reservation in the futu re – in their computer system, for example. Sally says, “Sure, it’s 234678.” The reser vation agent says, after looking it up on his computer, “That’s a reservatio n for Sally Menkel. Is that right?” Is that correct?

Sally says, “Yes, that’s right. I’d like to change the check-in date from September 15th to September 16th.” The “check-in date” is the  date when you arrive at the hotel. It’s the first night that you are going to s pend sleeping at the hotel. The opposite of a “check-in” would be a “check-out.” the “check-out date” is the date that you are leaving the hotel. Sally is changing her check-in date.

The reservation agent says, “Certainly, I can make that change for you. Is that the only change?” Sally says, “No. The checkout dat e will also change, from the 23rd to the 24th – September 24th, of course, being  perhaps the most important day of the year. The reservation agent then says, “ No problem,” which is an informal but very common way of saying “of course” or “yes,” especially when someone asks you to do something or thanks you for doing something. Often people will say, “Hey, thanks for that.” The other person will say, “No problem – it was nothing.”

The reservation agent asks if there are any other c hanges. Sally says, “Yes, there will be two people in my party,” noted one. T he word “party” (party) here doesn’t mean a celebration like a birthday party. I t refers to a group of people, usually people who are using some service at the sa me time. When you go to a nice restaurant, they may ask you how many are in y our party – that is, how many people are going to be sitting with you.

There was a TV show, actually – oh, I don’t know, b ack in the 1980s, 90s – called “Party of Five.” The “party” there refer to the number of people in the group. Now actually, I told this story before, but it’s been awhile, so I’ll tell it again.

The star of that television show “Party of Five” wa s a woman by the name of Neve Campbell. So, one day I’m in a Starbucks waiti ng to order my coffee near one of the big movie studios here in Los Angeles, a nd there’s a woman in front of me who I don’t recognize because I don’t watch very  much television, but a little

girl comes up to the woman and asked the woman for her autograph, for her signature. This is something you often do with famo us people. You ask them for their autograph so you can keep it and say, “See, I  met this famous person.”

So anyway, the little girl didn’t have a pen, and N eve Campbell (I later learned that was her name) said to the girl, “Oh, I don’t h ave a pen, sorry.” I, of course, being a nice guy, took a pen out of my pocket and g ave it to Neve, and Neve signed her autograph – I don’t know, it was probabl y on a small piece of paper – for the young girl. I only learned later who she re ally was.

Now here’s the problem. She kept my pen. Imagine! S he makes all of this money as a big Hollywood star and she steals my pen! So, Neve Campbell, if you are listening to this, bring back my pen.

Okay, back to the dialogue. Sally tells the reserva tion agent that there will be two people in her party. The reservation agent then say s, “I’ve made the change. Anything else I can help you with?” Sally says, “Ye s, instead of a courtyard room, I’d like a room with a view, preferably on an upper  floor.”

A “courtyard” (courtyard) – one word – is an open a rea that is surrounded by the walls of the building. Often in a courtyard you’ll have plants or trees and places for people to sit. This design for buildings is not  that common in the United States. It’s much more common in other countries, p articularly in Europe, but there are buildings that have courtyards, and that’ s what this hotel has.

It has a courtyard, and Sally wants something that is not a courtyard room. Instead, she wants “a room with a view.” A “view” ( view) here means something pretty or interesting to look at. If you go to a ho tel in Paris and you can see the Eiffel tower from your room, that would definitely be a room with a good view – or at least, a view of the Eiffel tower, if that’s wha t you really want to see.

So, Sally is asking for a room with a view. Of cour se, not all hotels have very interesting views. The views are only as interestin g as the place where the hotel is located, but Sally wants “a room with a view, pr eferably on an upper floor.” “Preferably” means that would be her first choice. An “upper floor” would be one of the higher levels, or higher floors, of the hote l – not on the first floor which, remember, in the United States is the same as the “ ground floor,” the first floor that you come into as you walk into the hotel.

Sally doesn’t want a room down there. She wants a r oom up high, on an upper floor. The agent says, “I can certainly change that  for you, although there will be a change in the room rate.” The “room rate” (rate) is the price of the room. We

often use that word when we’re talking about the pr ice of renting something for a certain amount of time. If you say, “I got a good r ate on my rental car,” you mean you got a good price, a low price. The agent tells Sally that the new room rate will be a $189 dollars per night.

Sally then says, “On second thought, I’d prefer a s uite that overlooks the pool. Is that possible?” “On second thought” is a common phr ase used when you change your mind and you want to let the other person know  that you’ve changed your mind. If you say to your wife, “I’d like to go to t he movies. No, wait. On second thought, let’s go to the beach instead,” you’re cha nging your mind and then telling the other person that you changed your mind .

Sally says, “On second thought, I’d prefer a suite that overlooks the pool.” A “suite” (suite) is a group of connected rooms in a hotel, usually a very large room with a bedroom and perhaps a kitchen or even other rooms. Hotel suites are obviously more expensive than a single hotel room.

Sally wants a room “that overlooks the pool.” “To o verlook” means to offer a view of something, usually above it. When you use this v erb “to overlook,” you’re normally talking about someplace that is high up, h igh above the ground, above whatever it is that it overlooks. If you are overlo oking the pool (meaning the swimming pool), your room is above the swimming poo l in the building and you can see the swimming pool from your room, from your  room’s window.

The reservation agent says, “Certainly. The new rat e is $249 per night.” A “suite,” again, is more expensive. Sally says, “Oh, that’s r eally expensive. I think I’d better stick to my original room.” “To stick to” so mething means to decide not to change your plans – to go with your original idea, your original plan. The agent says, “All right, I’ve changed your reservation bac k to a courtyard room. Anything else?”

Sally says, “Maybe I should shorten my stay.” She’s  suggesting that perhaps she won’t stay as many days as she had originally plann ed. She says, “If I do that I could afford a suite. Yes, let’s change the dates a nd the rooms again.” The agent says, “Let me make a suggestion. Let’s cancel this reservation and make a whole new one.” “To cancel” (cancel) means to decide that  you’re not going to continue doing something, or that some event that was suppos ed to take place will not take place. The agent suggests canceling the reserv ation completely and starting a whole new one.

Sally says, “Oh, that’s not too much trouble for yo u, is it? I’d hate to be a bother” (bother). When you say that you “hate to be a bothe r,” you mean that you don’t

 want to cause difficulties for the other person. Yo u don’t want to cause problems for the other person. “I don’t want to be a bother. ”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed
