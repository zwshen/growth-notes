On this episode, we’re going to talk about capital punishment – when the government kills someone for committing a crime. So unds happy. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Simon: What’s all that? 

Hilary: It’s a news report about the upcoming execu tion of Perry Hickock.  

Simon: That’s barbaric. We shouldn’t have capital p unishment in this day and age.  

Hilary: This guy killed an entire family while tryi ng to rob them in their own home. He was convicted of multiple murders and given the death penalty. This is about justice. 

Simon: This is about vengeance. He could have been given a life sentence without the possibility of parole. As it is, he has  spent 22 years on death row. 

Hilary: Oh, I see, you’re one those people who is s oft on crime. You think our criminals should be coddled. 

Simon: No, I don’t. But aside from my moral objecti ons, executing someone with a lethal injection or the electric chair is inhuman e. Many executions are botched each year.  

Hilary: So what? These are people convicted of seri ous crimes. They deserve all the punishment they get. 

Simon: I’m going to have to start calling you “Hang  ’em high Hilary.” 

Hilary: And I’ll have to start calling you “Soft-he arted Simon.” 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Simon asking Hilary, “What ’s all that?” Hilary says, “It’s a news report about the upcoming execution of Perry  Hickock.” It appears that Hilary is reading the newspaper about an “upcoming execution.” “Upcoming” means in the near future, or simply in the future. An “execution” (execution) is when someone is killed, especially as a punishment for a crime that he or she has committed or done.  

Simon says, “That’s barbaric,” referring to the exe cution, of course. “Barbaric” (barbaric) means not civilized, extremely cruel. Si mon says, “We shouldn’t have capital punishment in this day and age.” “Capital” (capital) punishment” is the act of killing someone by a government, usually because  a person has committed a crime. “This day and age” simply means “nowadays” –  in the current time.  

Hilary says, “This guy” – the man who is about to b e executed – “killed an entire family while trying to rob them in their own home.”  Hilary is saying that the man who is going to be executed killed an entire family , that means everyone in the family, while trying to rob them. “To rob” (rob) so meone is to steal things from him or her.  

Hilary continues, “He was convicted of multiple mur ders and given the death penalty. This is about justice.” “To be convicted” (convicted) means to be found guilty, usually by a judge and/or a jury – a group of people who decide if you are guilty or not of a crime. This person, according to  Hilary, was “convicted of multiple,” meaning many, “murders and given the dea th penalty.” The “death penalty” is the same as capital punishment. It is k illing someone for committing a crime. (The government, of course, killing someone. )  

Hilary says, “This is about justice” (justice). How  do we define justice? Well, Socrates, Plato, and other great philosophers have spent a lot of time trying to answer that question, but here it really means some thing that is fair, something that is considered right or correct, something that  is morally or ethically correct. Nowadays it is often associated with the law or law  enforcement. We have, for example, a “Department of Justice” in the United St ates that is responsible for legal issues at a national level for our government .  

Simon disagrees with Hilary. He says this is not ab out justice. “This is about vengeance,” he says. “Vengeance” (vengeance) is rev enge. When someone does something bad to you and you do something bad to that person, that is “vengeance” – a kind of revenge. We might also say informally “getting back at” someone. Simon continues, “He” – meaning Perry Hick ock, the killer – “could have been given a life sentence without the possibi lity of parole.” 

A “life sentence” is a punishment that puts you in jail for the rest of your life. The word “sentence” here does not refer to a subject an d a verb, but rather the punishment that you get from the government for com mitting a crime. A “life sentence” is when you are sent to prison for the re st of your life. Now, even if you are given a life sentence for doing something terri ble, committing some horrible crime, it is often possible to be released from pri son before you die.  

You can also get something called “parole” (parole) . “Parole” is when a prisoner leaves prison, either before or after his sentence is completed. So, if you are given a life sentence, you may, if you act appropri ately in prison and don’t cause any more problems, be given at some point “parole.”   

Now why do we have life sentences without parole? B ecause some people think that certain prisoners should never be released fro m prison, and so these people are given life sentences “without parole,” meaning there is no possibility for them to be released from prison in the future, other tha n when they die and are sent out in a coffin. A “coffin” (coffin) is a box that we put a dead body in when we are going to bury the body, put the body in the ground.   

Anyway, back to our story. Simon is saying that ins tead of killing this person, they could have given him a life sentence without parole . “As it is,” Simon says, meaning “instead,” “he has spent 22 years on death row.” “Death row” (row) is a part of a prison where people who are awaiting to b e executed are kept. The idea is that they are kept in a different part of the pr ison.  

Now, I don’t want to go into the whole topic of cap ital punishment here in the United States. I do want to say, however, that capi tal punishment is legal in some states but not others. So, of the 50 United States,  some of the states have capital punishment, states such as, I think, currently, Tex as. But many states, including California, do not have capital punishment. Instead  of killing the person, they get a life sentence without parole. “Death row,” then, would be a part of a prison where people who are awaiting to be executed are li ving or are kept.  

Hilary responds to Simon, “Oh, I see, you’re one of  those people who are soft on crime.” If you are “soft (soft) on crime,” you don’ t believe in punishing a criminal  

with a long sentence. You may believe in punishing criminals, but not as much as other people do. It’s a relative term. To say someo ne is soft on crime isn’t really a very meaningful criticism because it just depends o n what your definition of “soft” is.  

For some people, being “soft on crime” might be giv ing a prisoner 10 years in prison for a certain crime. For other people, it ma y be giving them 20 years. It just depends on the kind of punishment we’re talking abo ut. Hilary says, “You think our criminals should be coddled” (coddled). “To cod dle” someone is to treat them in a very gentle way, almost as you might treat a y oung child. Simon says, “No, I don’t. But aside from my moral objections, executin g someone with a lethal injection or the electric chair is inhumane.”  

Simon has “moral objections” to capital punishment,  meaning he doesn’t believe capital punishment is ethical. It goes against his sense of right and wrong. “Lethal” (lethal) means deadly – something that wil l kill you. An “injection” (injection) is when you or someone else such as a n urse or a doctor puts a needle in your body and puts some sort of liquid in side your body. A “lethal injection” would be an injection that kills you, an d that’s one way that some places carry out capital punishment.  

Another way is the use of something called the “ele ctric chair.” An “electric chair” is a chair in which a person is placed, and certain  wires are attached to the person’s body and you turn on the electricity, and that’s how you kill the person. Simon says that both of these methods of capital pu nishment are “inhumane” (inhumane). “Inhumane” means cruel – causing unnece ssary pain and suffering.  

Simon says, “Many executions are botched each year. ” “To botch” (botch) something means to do something wrong, to do it in such a way that it doesn’t work or it isn’t done properly. In this case, if an  execution is botched, the person doesn’t actually die, or doesn’t die as quickly as you had planned.  

Simon says, “I’m going to have to start calling you  ‘Hang ’em high Hilary.’” “Hang ’em high” is an old phrase used to describe someone  who is enthusiastic about killing someone by hanging them. “To hang” someone is to kill them by putting a rope around their neck and letting them hang in the  air. By calling Hilary “Hang ’em high Hilary,” Simon is criticizing her, saying that she’s too enthusiastic for capital punishment.  

Hilary says, “And I’ll have to start calling you “S oft-hearted Simon.” Someone who is “soft-hearted” is someone who doesn’t want t o punish other people or hurt  

other people. Once again, Hilary is using this as a n insult, saying that perhaps Simon is too nice to criminals.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
