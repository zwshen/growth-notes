On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Bianca and Conrad about management styles – the way people handle, or  manage, other people. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bianca: Today’s the day. We’re supposed to find out  who the new manager is going to be. I hope they’re not making a mistake by  hiring internally.

Conrad: I just hope they don’t pick Melissa. She wo uld be a disaster.

Bianca: Why do you say that? I like Melissa.

Conrad: I like her, too, but she can be so autocrat ic. Give her a little power and it goes to her head. Every decision would be top-down.

Bianca: You might be right, but I think Quentin wou ld be worse. He would be so laissez-faire that it would be like not having a ma nager at all. He’d delegate everything and then sit back and do nothing.

Conrad: I’ll grant you that. Quentin would be a hor rible manager. What about Jemima? She’s popular with nearly everybody in the office.

Bianca: I suppose Jemima would be a bearable option . She likes to collaborate and often consults with other people to get their f eedback. But I’m backing a different horse, one that would be the ideal.

Conrad: Who?

Bianca: You.

Conrad: Me? No way. I don’t have a chance in hell. And plus, how do you know I’d be a good manager?

Bianca: You’d be democratic in your decision making  and I’d like that. You wouldn’t rule with an iron fist.

Conrad: That’s what you think. Give me a little pow er and you can start calling me commandant.

Bianca begins our dialogue by saying to Conrad, “To day’s the day.” This is a common expression in English which means simply tha t something important is going to happen today or something I’m about to tel l you is going to take place today. Bianca tells us what is going to happen toda y in the dialogue. She says, “We’re supposed to find out who the new manager is going to be.”

A “manager” is a person who is responsible for cont rolling or handling or taking care of other people, usually related to some proje ct for your work. We might also use the word “supervisor.” A supervisor is a manage r who takes care of other people, who is in charge of other people, usually in a work environment.

Bianca says, “I hope they’re” – meaning the company  – “not making a mistake by hiring internally.” “To hire” (hire) means to give someone a job. Sometimes you’ll walk into a grocery store or a restaurant, and ther e will be a sign on the window that says “Now hiring.” That means they’re looking for people for jobs that they have available.

“To hire internally” (internally) means to hire som eone for a job from within your organization, from within your company. When you hi re internally, you don’t bring someone new to the company. You take someone who’s already working at the company and you give him or her this job. That’s of ten the case in large organizations where there are a lot of employees wh o already understand what the company does and the way it works. So, it’s eas ier to put one of them in charge as a manager.

Conrad says, “I just hope they don’t pick Melissa.”  “To pick” here means to select – to hire, in this case. Melissa, according to Conr ad, “would be a disaster.” She would be a terrible manager is what he means. Bianc a says, “Why do you say that? I like Melissa.” Conrad says, “I like her too , but she can be so autocratic.”

“To be autocratic” (autocratic) means to be someone  who has a lot of power and uses that power very “controllingly,” we might say – someone who is very strict with his or her employees, who’s always telling peo ple what to do, who is always using his or her power to control other people.

Conrad says, “Give her a little power and it goes to her head.” The expression “to go to one’s head” means something makes one feel ve ry proud, very important, and usually superior to other people. In other word s, you think you are better than other people because you were given this power , and suddenly you start to use this power – you start to think that you are mo re important than you really are. Conrad then says, “Every decision would be top -down.” The term “top-down” refers to a system of decision making in an organiz ation where everything is decided by the people at the top of the organizatio n – that is, the leaders.

Now of course, generally speaking, the leaders of a ny organization or company are the ones who make the big decisions, but if you  describe a company or an organization as having a very top-down management s tyle, you mean that almost everything gets decided by the leaders. The people who work at the company don’t have very much power. They don’t have a lot of influence on the decisions that are made. The opposite of “top-down” would be “bottom-up.” “Bottom-up” would be where people who are at the bottom of the company – the lowest employees, if you will – have some power and some i nfluence on decisions that are made.

Bianca says, “You might be right, but I think Quent in would be worse. He would be so laissez-faire that it would be like not havin g a manager at all.” The term “laissez-faire” (laissez-faire) means hands-off – s omeone who lets things go and doesn’t interfere, someone who doesn’t try to contr ol or direct the situation. The term is often used in the world of economics to tal k about an economic policy where the government doesn’t interfere with busines s or only interferes very minimally, not very much at all.

If we describe someone’s management style as “laiss ez-faire,” we mean that this person just lets things happen, doesn’t try to cont rol things or interfere with things. That’s why Bianca says “it would be like no t having a manager at all.” It would be as if there were no one in charge, no one serving or acting as a manager.

Bianca says, “He’d” – meaning Quentin – “delegate e verything and then sit back and do nothing.” “To delegate” (delegate) means to give other people things to do, to assign tasks to someone else, particularly t hings that are part of a larger project. If you are working on a large project, you  can’t possibly do everything

yourself. If you are the manager, you have to give other people things to do. You have to assign them things to do. That is what the verb “to delegate” means.

Conrad says, “I’ll grant you that.” That expression , “I’ll grant (grant) you that,” is used to express agreement with what another person has said – to indicate that the other person has made a good point, has said so mething that you agree with and that is correct. We use that expression when we  are having a disagreement with someone, but there’s something the other perso n said that we do want to agree with. So, we are using this expression to say , “Yes, on that specific thing, I agree with you.”

Conrad says, “Quentin would be a horrible manager. What about Jemima?” “She’s popular with nearly everybody in the office, ” Conrad says. Bianca says, “I suppose Jemima would be a bearable option.” When we  say something is “bearable” (bearable) we mean it would not be too d ifficult. It would not be too awful, but it wouldn’t be very good, either.

Bianca says that Jemima “likes to collaborate and o ften consults with other people to get their feedback.” “To collaborate” mea ns to work with other people in order to get something done. “To consult” (consult)  means to ask other people’s opinions, to get other people to tell you what they  think. “To get feedback” (feedback) is to get the opinions and reactions fro m other people. It’s similar to “consult.” “Consult,” however, has some other meani ngs in English which we won’t talk about here, but here it simply means to ask other people for their opinion. Bianca is saying that Jemima is the kind of person that would collaborate, consult, and get people’s feedback.

She says, however, “I’m backing a different horse, one that would be ideal.” “To back (back) a different horse” is an expression tha t means to support a different person or a different idea – to hope that someone e lse wins or something else is adopted or is successful. The verb “to back” means to support, usually by giving money to someone or doing something to help that pe rson win. We can talk about people who invest in a new company “backing” the company. They are supporting the company by giving the company money.

Conrad asks who Bianca is backing. Bianca says, “Yo u,” meaning Conrad. Conrad says, “Me? No way.” “No way” is an informal way of saying “absolutely not.” “I don’t have a chance in hell.” The expressi on “to not have a chance in hell” means that something is simply not going to happen.  It’s going to be nearly impossible or at least extremely unlikely that this  will happen. I’m guessing the expression comes from a longer phrase, which is “a snowball’s chance in hell.”

A “snowball” is made of cold snow and ice. “Hell” is traditionally thought of as being the place that is very hot. So, if you put a cold thing into someplace that is very hot, it probably won’t survive. In this case, the snowball will melt. Hence, we have this expression, “a snowball’s chance in hell, ” meaning not very likely. If you see a beautiful woman, your friend may say to you, “You don’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of getting her telephone number.” Th at would be an example.

Conrad says, “How do you know I’d be a good manager ?” He’s asking Bianca why Bianca wants him to be a manager. Bianca says, “You’d be democratic in your decision making, and I’d like that.” “To be de mocratic” here means that a person would allow other people on the project to v ote or to give their opinions and have their opinions matter. Bianca says, “You w ouldn’t rule with an iron fist.” The expression “to rule with an iron (iron) fist (f ist)” means something similar to autocratic. It means to be very strict, very contro lling.

Conrad says, “That’s what you think.” The expressio n “that’s what you think” is used to mean you have the wrong idea. You may think  that, but it’s not true. Conrad says, “That’s what you think. Give me a litt le power, and you can start calling me commandant.” “Commandant” (commandant) is a senior military leader. The idea here is that Conrad would be like someone in the military, giving orders and not asking for anyone’s opinion. Certain ly, the military is not normally known to be very democratic.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Although she’s a very powerful person, power has ne ver gone to our scriptwriter’s head – the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.
