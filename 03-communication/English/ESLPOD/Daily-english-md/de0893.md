[start of dialog]

Grace:  What happened to you?!

Paul:  I had a little accident at the game today.

Grace:  Little accident?!  You’re limping and obvio usly in pain!

Paul:  I just pulled a muscle in my back and aggrav ated my runner’s knee, that’s all.  It’s nothing to worry about.

Grace:  And you’re still recovering from the sprain ed ankle, concussion, and neck strain from three weeks ago.  Don’t you think you s hould sit out of the game for the next few weeks?

Paul:  I might have to, but these aren’t serious in juries.  They’re just part of playing sports.

Grace:  I hate to bring this up again, but you’re n ot 20-years-old anymore. Maybe your ligaments, tendons, and joints aren’t wh at they used to be.

Paul:  Don’t start with me.  I’m in the prime of my  life and in perfect physical condition.  Don’t try to tell me I’m over the hill just because I get an injury or two now and then.

Grace:  I’m not saying you’re over the hill.  I jus t worry that you can’t sit, stand, or lay down comfortably.

Paul:  Who says I can’t...ow!

Grace begins our dialogue by saying to Paul, “What happened to you?” That's a question we would ask, especially in that excited o r shocked tone of voice, in that surprised way, when you see something that you don' t expect, something is wrong with the other person. Grace says, “What happ ened to you?” And Paul says, “I had a little accident at the game today.” An “accident” is usually something that goes wrong. It could be you did some thing wrong and you hurt yourself, or it could be someone hit you and you go t hurt. Paul had a “little” accident. Grace says, “Little accident? You’re limp ing and obviously in pain.” Grace says this is no little accident. It's not a s mall or minor accident because Paul is limping. “To limp” (limp) means to walk wit h difficulty, not to walk normally. When you hurt your leg, for example, you usually will limp. You will walk in a funny way, in a strange way.

Paul says, “I just pulled a muscle in my back.” “To  pull a muscle” means to put too much force on a muscle, to strain it, to stretc h it in such a way that you hurt it. Paul says he pulled a muscle in his back and aggrav ated his “runner’s knee.” “To aggravate” (aggravate) means to make something wors e, typically something that is already bad. You do something to make somet hing that's already bad, even worse.

Paul had a bad knee. He had what is called sometime s “runner’s knee.” Your knee is that part of your body in the middle of you r leg that connects the top of your leg to the bottom of your leg. “Runner's knee”  is an injury that your knee can have, especially if you do a lot of running. You mi ght hurt it by running. That's why I never run. Never run! If you never run, you'l l never hurt your knee. That's my philosophy. So I never run.

Anyway, Paul, not as smart as I am, obviously, was a runner and he hurt his knee. By playing in the game yesterday, or I guess it was today, Paul aggravated his runner’s knee. He made it worse. Paul says, “It 's nothing to worry about.” You don't have to be concerned. Grace says, “And you're  still recovering from the sprained ankle, concussion, and neck strain from th ree weeks ago.” Grace says, “Wait a minute, you already had all of these other problems that were caused by playing in your sports game three weeks ago.” What are these problems?

The first is a sprained ankle. Your “ankle” (ankle)  is the part that connects your leg to your foot. “To sprain” (sprain) means to inj ure, to hurt. A sprained ankle, then, is when someone hurts their foot or that part  of their foot, usually, the muscles or some other part of the body that is arou nd the ankle.

 A “concussion” (concussion) is a temporary period, a short time, when you are unconscious, when you are not aware of what is happ ening to you. Why does this happen? Well, because usually you are hit, hit  in the head. If you get hit in the head hard, you might lose consciousness. It's a lmost like falling asleep. It can however, be a very serious problem. You might have damaged or hurt something when you were hit in the head. That would be to hav e a concussion. It happens a lot in certain sports where the players get hit in the head. That's why you should never  play sports where you get hit in the head. Just a little advice from me to you.

Grace talks about Paul's injuries and includes a “n eck strain” in her list. A “neck strain” is when you hurt a muscle in your neck. Thi s can happen if you are sitting at your computer all day and you keep putting your head in a certain position. You could eventually get neck strain. You could hur t your neck. This is why I always advise people, “ Never  sit in front of a computer!” Grace continues by saying, “Don't you think you should sit out of the game for the next few weeks?” “To sit out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning not  to participate in something, not to be involved in something, usually a game of some sort. “I'm going to sit out this evening of baseball.” I'm not going to play. I 'm going to sit it out, I'm not going to participate. Paul says, “I might have to,” meani ng I might have to sit out the next game, “but these aren't serious injuries.” An “injury” (injury) is when you hurt part of your body.

Paul says these are not serious injuries. They're j ust part of playing sports. Grace says, “I hate to bring this up again,” I hate to me ntion this again, “but you're not a twenty-year-old anymore.” You're not twenty years o ld and you don't have a body that will be able to do the kinds of physical activ ities that you have been doing. That's what Grace is saying. She says, “Maybe your ligaments, tendons and joints aren't what they used to be,” meaning these parts of your body are not as strong as they were when you were younger. What par ts of the body?

Well, she begins with “ligaments.” “Ligaments” (lig aments) are things in your body that connect bones or bones and other what are  called “tissues” – other substances in your body. A “tendon” (tendon) is som ething in your body that connects a muscle to a bone. So tendons connect mus cles to bones. The most famous tendon you have is called your “Achilles ten don.” That's the tendon that connects your lower leg muscle to your foot. The th ird thing that Grace mentions is “joints.” A “joint” (joint) is when two parts of  the body come together, for example, the top of your arm and the bottom of your  arm – your upper arm and lower arm are connected together at your elbow. Tha t's an example of a joint. So we have ligaments, tendons, and joints.

 Paul says, “Don't start with me.” This is an expres sion that means you don't want to hear what the other person is saying because the y’ve said it to you before over and over again, many times. “Don't start with me,” meaning, “Don't start criticizing me the way you usually do.” It's something that a h usband might say to a wife, for example – just an example, not me!

Paul says, “I'm in the prime of my life.” The “prim e (prime) of your life” are the best years of your life. Some people consider their  younger years to be the prime of their life. Other people consider their middle y ears to be the prime of their life. Some people consider their older years as the prime  of their life. I think of whatever age I am right now as the prime of my life . Paul says, “Don't try to tell me I'm over the hill.” “To be over the hill” means to be old, to be too old, to be more than halfway through your life. So, if you exp ect to live until you're 80, once you become 40, you are over the hill. I think I'm o ver the hill right now. I think I'm, I'm beyond the halfway point in my life, maybe.

Paul says, “Don't try to tell me, Grace, I'm over t he hill, just because I get an injury or two now and then” – every once in a while . Grace says, “I'm not saying you're over the hill. I just worry that you can't s it, stand, or lie down comfortably.” Paul says, “Who says I can't?” This is an expressio n you use when you are trying to tell the other person they’re wrong. Paul says, “Who says I can't?” And then he says, “Ow,” meaning he obviously can't sit, stand, or lie down without being in pain.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
