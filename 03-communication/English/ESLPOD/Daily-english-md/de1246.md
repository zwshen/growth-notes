[start of dialogue]

Matt: Hello, viewers! On our show today, we have Dr . Rodriguez, who is here to tell us about women’s health. Welcome, Dr. Rodrigue z.

Dr. Rodriguez: Thanks for having me.

Matt: Tell us. As a gynecologist, what one piece of  advice would you give to women to help them stay healthy?

Dr. Rodriguez: Well, as part of their regular check ups, they should be getting a gynecological exam.

Matt: This may surprise you, but I’ve never had one . Ha, ha!

Dr. Rodriguez: When women come in for an exam, I ch eck several things. I do a breast exam to check for lumps to detect breast can cer. I also show women how to do this at home on their own.

Matt: Is that all?

Dr. Rodriguez: No, I do a pelvic exam and a Pap sme ar to rule out cervical cancer. I also look for anything problematic, such as unusual discharge or signs of STDs.

Matt: That sounds painful. Ouch!

 Dr. Rodriguez: It’s not painful and it’s very impor tant. I also discuss with women their menstrual cycles, issues related to being sex ually active, birth control methods, fertility issues, and menopause.

Matt: I didn’t know what I was missing!

Dr. Rodriguez: My point is that it’s important for women to talk to their doctor about any medical issues they may have.

Matt: And my point is: I’m glad I’m not a woman!

Dr. Rodriguez: That’s not the message . . .

Matt: Thanks for coming in, doctor. And now, let’s talk about something really important – celebrity news!

[end of dialogue]

The term “gynecology” (gynecology) refers to the st udy of and practice of medicine for women, more specifically for those par ts of the human body that only women have – and if you don’t know what parts those are, you’ll have to ask your parents. Our dialogue begins with Matt saying,  “Hello, viewers!” “Viewers” implies that Matt is on some sort of television pro gram, and that is, in fact, the case. He next says, “On our show today,” meaning on  our television program, “we have” – we have as a guest – “Dr. Rodriguez, wh o is here to tell us about women’s health.”

He then says, “Welcome, Dr. Rodriguez,” and Dr. Rod riguez says, “Thanks for having me,” meaning thanks for inviting me to be on  this show, on this television program. Matt then says, “Tell us. As a gynecologis t, what one piece of advice” – what one thing – “would you give to women to help t hem stay healthy?” A “gynecologist” is a doctor who is specialized in gy necology, women’s medicine.

Dr. Rodriguez answers Matt’s question by saying, “W ell, as part of their regular checkups, they should be getting a gynecological ex am.” A “checkup” (checkup) is when you go to the doctor to have the doctor loo k at you and make sure there is nothing wrong with you. A checkup is usually som ething you do every year or perhaps every two years. We’ll sometimes refer to it as a “regular checkup,” meaning it’s scheduled even if you aren’t sick. You  go to the doctor and have the doctor examine you, look at you, make sure you’re o kay.

Dr. Rodriguez is recommending that women get regula r gynecological exams. Matt says, “This may surprise you, but I’ve never h ad one. Ha, ha!” He laughs. Of course, Matt is a man and men don’t get gynecologic al exams, though they do get other kinds of exams that women don’t, and we w on’t talk about those today. Dr. Rodriguez continues. She says, “When women come  in,” that is when they go to her office, “for an exam,” an examination or che ckup, “I check,” or look at, “several things. I do a breast exam to check for lu mps to detect breast cancer.”

A woman’s “breasts” are those two parts of her uppe r body that are on her chest. A “breast exam” is when a doctor uses his or her ha nds to look at the breast to make sure there isn’t any problem– to make sure in particular there are no “lumps” (lumps). A “lump” is a hard, raised area of  what we would call “tissue” (tissue) which is part of the body. A lump under the skin in the breast area could indicate that someone has breast cancer.

Dr. Rodriguez uses the verb “to detect” (detect). “ To detect” means to find and identify something – in this case, to make sure the  woman doesn’t have breast cancer. Dr. Rodriguez says, “I also show women how to do this at home on their own,” meaning how women can examine or check their own breasts to make sure there are no lumps indicating possible cancer.

Matt then says, “Is that all?” meaning is that all that you do? Dr. Rodriguez says, “No, I do a pelvic exam and a Pap smear to rule out  cervical cancer.” A “pelvic (pelvic) exam” is an examination of a woman’s pelvi s, which is basically the sexual and what we would call “reproductive” organs  – those parts of a woman’s body which would allow the woman to have a baby. So , the doctor does a pelvic exam and also does something called a “Pap (pap) sm ear (smear).”

A Pap smear is a special examination during which t he doctor collects cells, or small parts of a woman’s body, in order to make sur e that the woman doesn’t have any sort of cancer down in her pelvis area. the doctor then takes those small parts of the body, the cells, and sends them to be tested so that the doctor can see if there are any signs of cancer of the pel vis. The cancer that the doctor is trying to detect is called “cervical (cervical) cancer.” Cervical cancer is cancer of the cervix, which is inside of a woman’s body as  part of her “sexual organs,” we would say. You can Google it.

The phrasal verb “to rule (rule) out” means to test  something to make sure that it is not an option, to eliminate something as a possi bility. If a doctor is trying “to rule out cervical cancer,” he’s trying to make sure  that you do not have that kind of cancer by giving you a test. Unhappily, sometime s the doctor discovers that you do have cancer. He or she is not able “to rule it out.” Dr. Rodriguez

continues, “I also look for anything problematic,” meaning anything that looks like it might be a problem, “such as an unusual discharg e or signs of STDs.”

A “discharge” (discharge) is, in this case, a liqui d that comes out of the body that is unexpected or perhaps indicates some sort of pro blem. “STD” stands for “sexually transmitted diseases.” These are illnesse s that are passed or transmitted from one person to another through some  sort of sexual contact. Interesting fact: 110 million Americans, as of 2016 , have at any given time a sexually transmitted disease. The adult population of the United States in 2016 is around 216 million, meaning close to half of all Am ericans have an STD. So there’s that. Back to our dialogue.

Matt says, after Dr. Rodriguez talks about these un usual discharges, “That sounds painful. Ouch!” “Ouch” (ouch) is a word we u se when something is painful, something is causing us pain. He, of cours e, is trying to make a joke. Dr. Rodriguez says, however, that “it’s not painful and  it’s very important.” Dr. Rodriguez is referring, I think, to the pelvic exam  and Pap smear she talked about earlier.

Dr. Rodriguez continues, “I also discuss with women  their menstrual cycles, issues related to being sexually active, birth cont rol methods, fertility issues, and menopause.” A “menstrual (menstrual) cycle (cycle)”  is the process that women between certain ages go through each month as part of the body’s natural process of preparing a woman to have a baby, if the  conditions are right.

“To be sexually active” means to be having sexual r elations with another person. “Birth control” is a manner and approach, sometimes  a specific drug or device, that is used to prevent a woman from getting pregna nt. Research has found that the most effective form of birth control is not hav ing sex. True. Another thing Dr. Rodriguez mentions is “fertility” (fertility). “Fer tility” is the ability to have children, whether a man or a woman, or at least to participat e in the creation of new life.

“Menopause” (menopause) is a period in a woman’s li fe when, as she gets older, she stops having her normal menstrual cycle and is therefore no longer able to give birth, to have a child naturally. This happens  for many women sometime between the ages of 45 and 50. A man never has meno pause per se, although men as they get older are also typically less ferti le. Unless you’re Mick Jagger, the rock star who recently had a child, or we would  say “fathered a child,” at the age of 71.

Matt, again trying to be funny, says, “I didn’t kno w what I was missing!” referring to what Dr. Rodriguez was talking about. The expres sion “I didn’t know what I

was missing” is used to show how you were unaware of something. You didn’t know about something, especially something that per haps you would want to participate in. That’s the joke here, of course. Ma tt, being a man, cannot have a gynecological examination.

Dr. Rodriguez says, “My point” – what I’m trying to  say – “is that it’s important for women to talk to their doctor about any medical iss ues,” any problems, “they may have.” Matt says, “And my point is: I’m glad I’m no t a woman!” Once again, Matt is trying to be funny. Dr. Rodriguez, however, does n’t have much of a sense of humor. She doesn’t think this is funny. Dr. Rodrigu ez says, “That’s not the message . . .”

And then Matt interrupts. He, we would say, “cuts h er off.” He stops her from speaking. He says, “Thanks for coming in, doctor. A nd now let’s talk about something really important – celebrity news!” “Cele brity” refers to someone who is famous. Matt, of course, is now going to talk ab out something that most people don’t consider very important at all – what rich, f amous people are doing, people like, you know, Mick Jagger.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
