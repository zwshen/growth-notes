Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 804: Dealing with Time Changes in Scheduling.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 804.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is all about scheduling and changing t imes.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Danny:  Don’t bother looking for next year’s meetin g calendar.  I’m still working on it.

Tessa:  What’s taking so long?

Danny:  This is my first time scheduling all of the  major meetings for this company and I’m getting thrown off by all of the th ings I have to keep in mind. For instance, our bylaws say that we have to have a  management meeting every 60 days.  This is a leap year, so do I have to take  that into account?

Tessa:  That’s a tough one.  I’m not sure.

Danny:  And what about daylight saving time?  I hav e to remember when clocks will be set ahead and back.

Tessa:  That’s easy.  My high school teacher taught  us to remember it with a simple phrase: “fall back and spring ahead.”

Danny:  Okay, but that doesn’t help me with dates.  Apparently, daylight saving time changes on different dates in different countr ies.  And I have to factor in time zones to set the time for each meeting, with meetin g times that work for each international office that will be participating.

Tessa:  You’re right, it’s a tall order, but you do  know that someone has done this before?  You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

Danny:  Yeah, Carl set the meeting calendar last ye ar, but he left the company last month.

Tessa:  Can’t you just take last year’s meeting cal endar and fudge it?

Danny:  Why do you think Carl is no longer with the  company?

Tessa:  Ah.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins Danny saying to Tessa, “Don’t b other looking for next year’s meeting calendar.”  “Don’t bother” is a phrase we u se to tell someone not to do something because it isn’t possible or they won’t b e successful.  “Don’t bother” means don’t look for next year’s meeting calendar.  “Calendar” is, you probably know, a record of days and weeks and years that you  use to perhaps schedule your life around, to plan, to know what date and da y it is.  Danny says he’s still working on next year’s meeting calendar, which we g uess is a calendar telling you which days and times they will have meetings at  their company.

Tessa says, “What’s taking so long?”  Why is it tak ing you so long, you idiot?  No! She didn’t say “you idiot,” she could have but she didn’t.  So the idiot Danny says, “This is my first time scheduling all of the major meetings for this company and I’m getting thrown off by all of the things I h ave to keep in mind.”  Danny says this is the first time he has scheduled – he h as decided what days and times – all of the major or important meetings for the company.  “And,” he says, “I’m getting thrown off by all of the things I have  to keep in mind.”  “To be thrown off” means to be confused, to be misled, when someo ne makes it or something makes it difficult or impossible for you to underst and something.  It can also be used sometimes when some unexpected or sudden chang e interrupts your plans so you can no longer do what you were going to do: “The thunderstorm (the rainstorm) canceled our flight (our airplane flight ).  It threw off our plans.”  It made them impossible to complete; it changed them unexpe ctedly.

In the dialogue, Danny is thrown off; he’s not able  to do what he thought he was able to do because all of the things he has to keep  in mind – he has to remember.  “To keep in mind” (mind) means to rememb er.  Danny says, “For instance (for example), our bylaws say that we have  to have a management meeting every 60 days.”  Your “bylaws” (bylaws) are  your official rules created by

your organization.  The bylaws are usually rules th at the company uses to help it operate more smoothly, to make sure everything is d one correctly.  Well, these bylaws say they have to have a management meeting –  a meeting of the managers – every 60 days.  Danny says, “This is a l eap year, so do I have to take that into account?”  A “leap (leap) year” is a  year, you probably know, that has 366 days; it happens once every four years when  we have a February 29 th , not just 28 days in February.  Well, poor Danny is not sure what to do during a leap year.  He says, “do I have to take that into a ccount?”  “To take (something) into account” means to include it or consider it in  your decision or your opinion. You have to take into account that Danny is an idio t, and that helps you understand the dialogue a little better; you have to consider that in your opinion. Danny is wondering whether you have to take into ac count the fact that this year is a leap year.

Tessa says, “That’s a tough one.”  Now, Tessa, it’s  not a tough one, it’s obvious. February 29 th  is a day, you just count that into the 60 days.  I t’s not that difficult people!  Huh!  I’m sorry, I – I’m not in a very goo d mood today.  I don’t know why, probably didn’t have enough coffee this morning.  D id I tell you I’m drinking coffee now?  Yeah, yeah.  No, um – well I still dri nk, uh, tea, but, uh, I’ve started drinking coffee again.  But when I don’t have my co ffee then, you know, I’m not in a very good mood.

Anyway, back to our dialogue: Tessa says – wrongly – that this is a tough one, this is a difficult decision.  She says she’s not s ure.  Danny says, “And what about daylight saving time?”  “Daylight saving time ” is a system used in many countries where you move your clock ahead one hour and then back one hour twice a year in order to give people, in part, more  hours of light in the evening time.  We talked about daylight saving time back on  English Café number 78, many, many years ago.  Danny says, “I have to remem ber when clocks will be set ahead and back.”  “To set ahead” means to turn the clock forward one hour, so instead of being 10:00 now it’s 11:00.  “To set the clock back” would mean to go from 11:00 to 10:00.  It’s really not that compl icated Danny!  I should mention that the expression “to set back” has other meaning s in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.

Tessa says, “That’s easy.  My high school teacher t aught us to remember it with a simple phrase: ‘fall back and spring ahead.’”  Th is expression “fall back and spring ahead” is used in English to remind people w hen they are supposed to put their – or set their clocks ahead and when they’re supposed to set them back.  In the fall – in the autumn, they put the clocks back;  they fall back.  “To fall back” means to go backwards, and so we use the two meanin gs of the word “fall.” “Fall” means the season of autumn: in North America  roughly October,

November, December.  And it also means, when you say “fall back,” you mean to go back, to move backwards.  So, “fall back” remind s you that in the fall you set your clock back an hour, and in the spring you spri ng ahead.  “To spring ahead” means to jump forward.  “Spring” also refers to the  season of the year that comes between winter and summer.  So “spring ahead” means  to move your clock forward one hour during the springtime.

Danny says, “Okay, but that doesn’t help me with da tes.  Apparently, daylight saving time changes on different dates in different  countries.”  This is true; it’s different in the United States than it is in Europe .  He says, “And I have to factor in time zones to set the time for each meeting.”  “ To factor in” means to include or to consider; it means the same as “to take (some thing) into account.”  Danny has to factor in time zones.  A “time zone” is a ge ographic area where people use the same time.  Here in California, we’re in the Pa cific time zone.  So, it’s the same time in Los Angeles as it is in Oregon or in W ashington or in British Columbia, Canada, or in Baja, California.  New York  City is in the Eastern time zone, where there is a three hour difference betwee n the Pacific and the Eastern time zones.  Well, Danny has to factor in time zone s to set or to establish the time for each meeting because there are people in d ifferent parts of the world who participate.

Tessa says, “You’re right (you’re correct), it’s a tall order.”  A “tall order” is something that’s very difficult or challenging that  you have been asked to do. Tessa says, “but you do know that someone has done this before?  You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.”  This is an old expres sion: “to reinvent (reinvent) the wheel” means you don’t have to waste time doing som ething that someone has already done.  “To invent” means to create, to come  up with a new idea.  Well the wheel was invented many, many years ago; you don’t have to come up with the idea of a wheel again.  It means, again, you don’t need to waste your time; you can find out what someone else did before and do wh at they did.

Danny says, “Yeah, Carl set the meeting calendar la st year, but he left the company last month.”  Tessa says, “Can’t you just t ake last year’s meeting schedule and fudge it?”  “To fudge (fudge) (somethi ng)” means to change something in a small way, presenting it as the real  answer even though you’re really just guessing; you’re not really sure.  You’ re trying to fool someone into thinking that you know what the answer is, so you k ind of take a guess but you know it’s not the exact answer, or you don’t think it’s the exact answer.  Danny says, “Why do you think Carl is no longer with the company?”  Tessa says, “Ah.” In other words, the joke here is that Carl, the per son who used to do the calendar, didn’t do a very good job.  He – he wasn’ t accurate; he fudged his

calendar dates.  He didn’t calculate them very care fully, and that’s why he was fired.  So, it would be a bad idea for Danny to do the same thing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
