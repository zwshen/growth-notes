This episode is called “Reading a World Map.”  We’re go ing to talk about vocabulary related to maps.  This is a dialogue between G reg and Julianna. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Greg:  What are you doing with that map and that gl obe?

Julianna:  I’m trying to keep track of Carmen as she travel s from country to country.  I just got another postcard from her today.

Greg:  I’m not sure I like the idea of my daughter tra veling around the world with a group of people for three months.  It’s not safe.

Julianna:  She can take care of herself.  You know she’ s the adventurous type. Give her a compass and she can find her way around anywh ere.  Help me find Nauru on this map.  I don’t even know what continent it’s on.  I was never any good at geography.

Greg:  All right.  You look above the equator and I’l l look below it, but couldn’t you just look it up on the Internet?  It would be easy to find the latitude and longitude of this place.

Julianna:  This is more fun.  I sort of feel like I’m on  an adventure myself.

 Greg:  I can’t make heads or tails of this map.  It’s n ot to scale and this legend is all wrong!

Julianna:  It doesn’t matter.  We just need to find the place name, and then I can put a pin in this map showing where’s she’s been.

Greg:  I have a better idea.  I’ll look it up on the Internet and get you all of the vital statistics you’d want, like its location, okay?

Julianna:  Forget it.  Sometimes it’s more fun doing t hings the hard way.

[end of dialogue]

Greg begins by asking Julianna (or Julianna, I think she pr efers Julianna), “What are you doing with that map and that globe?”  A “map ” is a piece of paper with drawings on it that shows the location of places.  “Map”  actually has a couple of different meanings in English however.  To find those t ake a look at our Learning Guide for this episode.  A “globe” (globe) is a round ball that has a special stand, and it goes around, and on this ball is a map of the world so you can see where all of the countries are in the entire world.

Greg says, “What are you doing with that map and globe. ”  Julianna says, “I’m trying to keep track of Carmen as she travels from country to  country.  I just got another postcard from her today.”  A “postcard” (one wor d) is a small rectangular, typically, piece of paper that you send through the mail .  It usually has a picture of the place you are visiting, and on the back you write a message, something like “Wish you were here,” meaning I wish that you could be with me.  Usually not though, usually you – you don’t want other people with you on vacation.  But you say that, right?

Julianna says, “I just got another postcard from Carmen to day.”  Greg says, “I’m not sure I like the idea of my daughter traveling aroun d the world with a group of people for three months.  It’s not safe.”  So, Greg an d Julianna have a daughter who is going around the world with a group of people .  Julianna says, “She can take care of herself.  You know she’s the adventurous type .”  Someone who is “adventurous” is someone who is always looking for excitemen t, wanting to do new and unusual things.  I am not the adventurous type.  I prefer to sit in my chair, drink some tea, and read my book.  I’m kind of a b oring person basically!

Julianna says, “Give her (meaning give Carmen) a compass and  she can find her way around anywhere.”  A “compass” (compass) is a small, fla t, round device

 that has an arrow in it, and the arrow always points no rth no matter which way you hold it.  It’s something that a traveler would use t o know what direction they should go in, especially if you are, for example, out in the woods, or away from anything that would give you a good indication of which  direction was north, at nighttime for example.

She says that Carmen can find her way around anywhere w ith a compass.  She then says to Greg, “Help me find Nauru on this map.  I don’t even know what continent it’s on.”  Nauru, of course, is a country.  A “co ntinent” is one of the seven large areas of land in the world.  We talk about seven continents in the U.S.: we talk about Africa, Asia, Antarctica, Australia,  Europe, North America, and South America.  In some places they talk about five co ntinents, but in the United States we have seven, or at least that’s what we sa y.  Julianna is trying to find what continent the country of Nauru is on.  She says,  “I was never any good at geography.”  “Geography” is the study of the surface or  the area of somewhere on Earth, especially where things like countries and citie s are located; that’s part of geography.

Greg says, “All right (okay).  You look above the equator and I’ll look below it.” The “equator” is an imaginary line around the middle of our planet, Earth.  It separates the north half from the south half.  We call  these halves “hemispheres.”  So there’s the northern hemisphere, wh ere I live, and the southern hemisphere, where perhaps you live.  That’s what  the equator is.  So, Greg is going to look in the northern hemisphere, and  Julianna will look in the southern one.  He says, “couldn’t you just look it up on the Internet?”  Greg says, “It would be easy to find the latitude and longitude of this place.”  “Latitude” refers to imaginary lines that go around the earth from east to west, you might say. “Longitude” are lines that are “perpendicular,” they’r e at a right angle to latitude lines.  Longitude lines go, if you will, from north to  south.  If you know the latitude – if you know how far north or south something is, and longitude, how far east or west something is, then you can find a place.  Every place o n Earth has a specific latitude and longitude.  Latitudes are sometime s called “parallels,” so we talk about the 45th parallel.  These latitude lines are sometimes used, for example, in dividing countries or areas.

Julianna says, “This is more fun.  I sort of feel like I’m on an adventure myself.”  “I sort of” means I somewhat, I kind of, to a certain exten t: “I sort of don’t want to go and see my brother-in-law.”  I sort of don’t want to g o, I kind of, it’s not something that I – I love to do.  I’m not completely against the  idea, but I sort of don’t want to go.  Well, Julianna says she sort of feels like she’s on an  adventure.

 Greg says, “I can’t make heads or tails of this map.”  The expression “to make heads or tails (tails) of (something)” means to be abl e to understand something. The word “heads and tails” comes from a coin; there are  two sides.  A front of a coin we call the head, and the back of the coin called the tail.  So the expression “to make heads or tails of” means to be able to unders tand.  We use it in talking about anything that seems very confusing to us.  Greg says, “ It’s not to scale and this legend is all wrong!”  Greg is saying that the map is not to scale.  “To scale” means that the actual distance on the map between two p oints – between, say, one city and another city – the distance on the map is the  same in proportion to the actual distance.  That is, if you look at a map on the United States that is to scale, you’ll see that 500 miles from Los Angeles to the n orth is perhaps two inches.  Well, two inches on anywhere in the map equals 5 00 miles.  That’s a map that is drawn to scale.  A “legend,” sometimes called  a “key” (key), is a small box on a map that explains what the different colors or  symbols mean on that particular map.  They often also tell you what the scale  is: one inch equals one mile, or one inch equals 200 miles.

Julianna says, “It doesn’t matter (it’s not important if it’s not to scale and the legend is all wrong).  We just need to find the place name.”  The “place name” is the word on a map that indicates the country or city or other place where this thing is.  “Then,” she says, “I can put a pin on this ma p showing where’s she’s been.”  A “pin” is a small piece of metal, like a small  little stick, but you use it to attach, say, a piece of paper to the wall.

Greg says, “I have a better idea.  I’ll look it up on t he Internet and give you all the vital statistics you’d want, like its location, okay?”  “Vital  (vital) statistics” in this case means detailed information, numerical information .  Technically, it usually refers to how many people are born, how many people di e, coming from the Latin (vita) “vita,” or “vita,” referring to life.  But here , it just means the specific details. Julianna doesn’t want to look it up on the Internet h owever.  She says, “Forget it. Sometimes it’s more fun doing things the hard way,” doi ng things in the most difficult way possible.

Where’s Nauru?  Well, I looked it up on the Internet;  I didn’t look on a map or a globe.  It’s actually a small island nation in the Sout h Pacific.  Maybe I’ll go there one day and visit!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
