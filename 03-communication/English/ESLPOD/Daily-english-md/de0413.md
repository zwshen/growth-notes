This episode is called “Talking About Intelligence.”  It’ s a dialogue between Andre and Josephine, where they’re talking about how smart, or  how intelligent, certain people are, and they’ll use a lot of vocabulary related  to smart or not so smart people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Andre:  Mom, I can’t believe I got stuck with Matt as my l ab partner in school.

Josephine:  Matt?  Do I know Matt?

Andre:  He lives down the street.  He’s Mr. and Mrs. Ke mp’s son.  He’s a total airhead.

Josephine:  Oh, I remember him.  He was at your birth day party.

Andre:  Yeah, when I was nine years old!  That guy is so dense!

Josephine:  Matt was always considered a gifted child.  He seemed bright and perceptive, and his parents thought he’d go far.

Andre:  If you ask me, he’s not all there.  Every time I look over at him in class, he’s staring off into space.  He doesn’t seem like the kind  who’s very quick on the uptake.

Josephine:  You know, some very smart people can seem spacey t o the rest of us.  Maybe he’s just thinking when he stares off into space.

Andre:  Maybe.  All I know is that my science grade is rid ing on how we do in the lab, so I hope he shapes up.

 Josephine:  I’m sure he will.  And even if he doesn’t, you’re clever enough to still do well in the class.

Andre:  Thanks, Mom, but I wouldn’t bet on it!

Our dialogue begins with Andre, who’s talking to his mo ther, saying, “Mom, I can’t believe I got stuck with Matt as my lab partner in sch ool.”  The expression “to be stuck with” is a phrasal verb meaning that you are forced to, or have to do something that you don’t want to do or don’t like doin g.  Sometimes this happens because you, perhaps, were late or someone else didn’t do  their work and they gave it to you to do, then you are stuck with it; you have to do it even though you don’t like it.

Well, Andre is stuck with a lab partner at school and he doesn’t like him.  A “lab partner” is someone in school who works with you in a labo ratory, usually as part of a science class.  In most science classes, or many science classes, y ou have two, three, or even four people – students – working on  the same project; those are your lab partners.  Often the teacher will assign stu dents to their lab partners; they don’t give them a choice.  I remember when I was t aken biology in high school I had a lab partner I didn’t particularly like, b ut that’s just the way it goes.

Josephine says, “Matt?  Do I know Matt?”  Matt is the name  of his new lab partner.  Andre says, “He lives down the street (meaning he lives close to our house).  He’s Mr. and Mrs. Kemp’s son.  He’s a total air head.”  When you call someone an “airhead” (airhead – one word), you’re sayi ng that person is stupid, that person is not smart, that person is dumb.  This is a n informal expression, of course.  If you call someone an “airhead” you’re saying tha t they’re not very smart, or you’re saying that they get confused easily or th ey don’t remember things very well.  Those are also possibilities for someone  who is called an “airhead.”

Josephine says, “Oh, I remember him.  He was at your birth day party.”  Andre says, “Yeah, when I was nine years old!”  Meaning that wa s a long time ago; he’s obviously 15 or 16 now so nine years old seems like a long t ime ago.  Andre says, “That guy is so dense!”  To be “dense” (dense) is ano ther word, again, for stupid, dumb, not very intelligent, not able to underst and things very easily. Again, it’s an insulting term; it’s not a nice to say ab out someone, that they’re dense.  It’s often used to describe people who you try to  talk to and explain things to but they don’t quite understand.

 The mother, Josephine, says, “Matt was always considered a gi fted child.”  In the school system in the United States, if you say is someone is “ gifted,” you mean they are supposed to have special intelligence or special t alents.  They’re supposed to be very smart, and in many schools there are speci al programs that are set up for these supposedly smarter children.  Unfort unately in many cases, all of the parents think that their children are gifte d, and so it sometimes doesn’t really mean anything.  My parents never thought I was gif ted, and they were right!

Josephine says, “He seemed bright and perceptive.”  To be “ perceptive” means you are able to understand things quickly, so it’s sort of  the opposite of being dense.  Josephine says Matt’s parents thought he’d go far .  To “go far,” in this case, means to do well in life, to succeed, to do great t hings.  My teacher said, “Jeff, you will go far.”  Not all predictions come true!

Andre, however, disagrees.  He says, “If you ask me (if you are asking my opinion), he’s not all there.”  When you say someone is “not all there,” you mean that they seem to be thinking about something else all the time; they never seem to be focused on the present or current situation.  The y’re distracted; they’re thinking about other things: “he’s not all there.”  Th at may be something that happens all the time, or it may be something that happ ens every once in a while. But here, Andre is saying that Matt is like this all the time.  “Every time I look over at him in class,” Andre says, “he’s staring off into space.”  To “stare” (stare) means to look at something, usually to look at it for a ve ry long time.  To “stare off into space,” however, means to have your eyes open, bu t you’re not really looking at anything in particular because you’re thinking .  You’re thinking a lot, and your eyes are just sort of pointed in a certain direct ion.  You’re staring off into space – you’re thinking about something else and not payin g attention to what is happening around you.

Andre says Matt doesn’t seem like the kind who’s very quick on  the uptake.  To describe someone as “quick on the uptake” means they’re a f ast learner; they understand things very quickly.  Josephine says, “You know, some very smart people can seem spacey to the rest of us.”  Some very sma rt, intelligent people can seem spacey.  To be “spacey” is to be someone who stares  off into space, who’s a bit of an airhead, who doesn’t concentrate on w hat is around them because they are thinking about other things.  Josephine s ays, “Maybe he’s just thinking when he stares off into space.”  Andre says, “Mayb e.  All I know is that my science grade is riding on how well do in the lab, so I hope he shapes up.” Andre is concerned that Matt, as his partner, won’t do h is work correctly and they will both get a bad grade.  He says his science grade is “ riding on.”  To “ride on”

 means to depend on, to be affected by something.  So, yo u could say, “The amount of money I get at my work is riding on how many sa les I can make this year.”  It’s dependent on that thing.  To “shape up” m eans to improve, to do better.  Somebody says, “he needs to shape up,” they mean  he needs to do better; he needs to meet the standards or expectations of  this other person.

Well, Andre is hoping that Matt will “shape up” – he  will get better so that his science grade doesn’t “suffer,” doesn’t go lower because of him.  The word “shape” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Josephine says, “I’m sure he will (I’m sure he will shape up).  And even if he doesn’t, you’re clever enough to still do well in the cla ss.”  To be “clever” means to be smart, but specifically to be able to find new or creative solutions to something.  We might describe, for example, a police det ective – someone who tries to find the person who committed a crime – as bein g “clever,” smart, able to figure out a situation or understand a situation.

Andre says, “Thanks, Mom, but I wouldn’t bet on it!”  To  “bet on” something is a phrasal verb meaning to believe that something is or wil l be true.  In fact, you are so sure that is going to happen that you are willing to  “bet,” to gamble money, saying that this will happen.  It’s a general expression m eaning it probably won’t happen; you should not depend on that happening.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
