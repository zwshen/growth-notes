This episode is a dialogue between Paresh and Sandy  about having enough food for a big family when you don’t have a lot of money . Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paresh: Are you shopping for an army?

Sandy: Oh hi, Paresh. No, my three nephews have com e to live with me. I’m not sure how I’m going to feed them on a tight budget.

Paresh: My mother was a master at making a little g o a long way. There are seven kids in my family.

Sandy: What did she do?

Paresh: She only bought fruits and vegetables that were in season and generic or store brands.

Sandy: I’m trying to do that and also buying only s taples.

Paresh: My mother also bought in bulk and stocked u p when things were on sale.

Sandy: I’ll need to start doing that.

Paresh: She was also able spend less by using some time-tested recipes. She planned meals for an entire week and each ingredien t did double duty. Nothing went to waste.

Sandy: That sounds like a good plan.

 Paresh: My mom also never turned her nose up at day -old bread or marked- down food. She was amazing and she made it work.

Sandy: I need to take a cue from your mother. I love those boys but they’re going to eat me out of house and home!

[end of dialogue]

Paresh begins our dialogue by asking Sandy, “Are yo u shopping for an army?” “To shop” means to go and buy things. An “army,” of  course, is a large group of people, usually, who are fighting for a country as part of their military. So, the question “Are you shopping for an army?” is of cour se a joke. We can imagine that Sandy and Paresh are at the grocery store – a place where you buy food – and Sandy has a lot of food in her shopping cart, in that little thing that you push around a store that you put your food in while you are shopping.

Sandy says, “Oh hi, Paresh. No, my three nephews ha ve come to live with me.” Sandy says that she has three nephews – sons of eit her her sister or her brother – who are now living at her house. We’re not sure w hy. Sandy says, “I’m not sure how I’m going to feed them” – how I am going to giv e them enough food – “on a tight budget.” Your “budget” (budget) is the amount  of money you have to spend on something. A “tight (tight) budget” is the same as a “small budget,” which is not very much money, a very limited amount of money .

Paresh says, “My mother was a master at making a li ttle go a long way.” “To be a master” (master) at something means to be very good  at something. Paresh says his mother “was a master at making a little go a lo ng way.” “To make a little go a long way” means to be able to use a very small amou nt of money to do a lot of things, to be very efficient about the way you spen d your money. Paresh says, “There are seven kids in my family.” Paresh thinks he has a big family, but we all know he doesn’t really. I mean, I come from a famil y of 11 children so, Paresh – yeah, not so big.

Sandy says, “What did she do?” meaning what did you r mother do in order to feed all of you or give you all enough food. Paresh  responds, “She only bought fruit and vegetables that were in season and generi c or store brands.” When we say fruits or vegetables are “in season,” we mean that they are growing at this particular time of year, usually in the area where you live. For example, in the Midwestern United States, where I grew up, corn was  in season in August and September. That’s when the corn was ready to eat, that was being grown in the area around where I lived.

 Well, there wasn’t any corn where I grew up next to  me. I mean, I grew up in the city, but in the general area of Minnesota there wa s a lot of corn, especially in August and September. The corn was “in season.” Fru it and vegetables that are in season are usually cheaper, or less expensive to  buy. That’s one way that Paresh’s mother was able to feed her family. Paresh ’s mother also only bought “generic” (generic) or “store brands” (brands). A “ generic” or “store brand” is usually a product that is made to taste like or loo k like a more famous kind of product but is a lot cheaper.

For example, you can buy Coca-Cola, a type of soda,  at most American grocery stores, but you can also buy soda (or “soda pop,” a s it is called in some places) that tastes similar to Coca-Cola but has a differen t name on it. This is often a “generic” or a “store brand” that is produced at a cheaper price and that isn’t as expensive as a similar product made by a more famou s company. It’s not exactly like the more famous brand. You can’t buy pop or so da pop that tastes like Coca- Cola exactly, but it’s similar and it’s usually che aper. That’s a “generic” or “store brand.”

Sandy says she is trying to do something similar. S he’s also trying to buy only “staples.” A “staple” (staple) refers here to a bas ic ingredient that can be used in many different ways to make different kinds of food . A “staple,” at least in the United States, would probably include things like m ilk, eggs, salt, perhaps sugar, certain kinds of meat – these are ingredients or th ings you can make food out of that can be used in many different ways or that are  considered things that everyone needs or wants to eat.

In some countries, rice is a staple. You will eat r ice at almost every meal. In other countries, potatoes are a staple. They are things y ou eat all the time. Paresh continues, “My mother also bought in bulk and stock ed up when things were on sale.” “To buy in bulk” (bulk) means to buy a lot of something, to buy a large quantity of something. So, instead of buying, say, two cans of corn, you would buy 10 cans of corn. You would buy in bulk because often it’s cheaper to buy a lot of something.

There are stores here in the U.S. where you can onl y buy in bulk. You have to buy a lot of things of whatever it is you’re buying . Paresh’s mother also “stocked up when things were on sale” – that is, when they w ere being sold at a lower price by the store. “To stock (stock) up on” someth ing is a phrasal verb meaning to buy a large amount of something to use in the fu ture. Sandy says, “I’ll need to start doing that.”

Paresh continues, “She was also able to spend less by using some time-tested recipes.” Something that is “time-tested” is someth ing that has been used many times in the past, often in the past, by different people and has been found to be successful or has worked very well. A “recipe” (rec ipe) is written instructions about how to cook something. Paresh says his mother  “planned meals for an entire week and each ingredient did double duty.”

An “ingredient” (ingredient) is something that you combine with something else to make a certain kind of food. So, if you’re going to  make bread, you’re going to need flour as one of your ingredients. You’re proba bly going to use eggs and water and a few other things. Those are all “ingred ients” you use to make the bread. Paresh’s mother made each ingredient that sh e bought from the store “do double duty” (duty). The expression “to do double d uty” means to use something in two different ways.

“Nothing went to waste,” Paresh says, meaning every thing his mother bought, she used somehow in her cooking. Sandy says, “That sounds like” – or that appears to me to be – “a good plan,” a good idea. P aresh says that his mother “never turned her nose up at day-old bread or marke d-down food.” “To turn your nose (nose) up” at something means to refuse to do something because you think you’re too good for that thing, or you are be tter than something that you are being asked to do.

You may turn your nose up at working as a janitor –  cleaning toilets – because you think you are better than that. Paresh says his  mother “never turned her nose up at day-old bread.” “Day-old bread” would be  bread that was made yesterday and therefore isn’t fresh. If you go to a  bakery – a place that makes bread – “day-old bread” will be cheaper even though  it isn’t as good.

“Day-old bread” is an example of food that would be  “marked down.” “To mark down” the price of something is to reduce the price  of something, to make something cheaper to buy. Sandy says, “I need to ta ke a cue (cue) from your mother.” “To take a cue” from someone means to foll ow someone else’s example, to do what someone else has done. Cindy sa ys, “I love those boys but they’re going to eat me out of house and home!”

This is an old expression. “To eat someone out of h ouse and home” means to eat a lot of food, so much so that the parents don’ t have enough food to give everyone enough to eat. It’s a phrase used to descr ibe children who have big appetites, who like to eat a lot of food. Why do we  say both “house” and “home” in the expression, you may be wondering. I don’t kn ow. It’s just an old

expression. Sometimes there isn’t a logic to why ex pressions are the way they are. That’s just what we say – “to eat someone out of house and home.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
