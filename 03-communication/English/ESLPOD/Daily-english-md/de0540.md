This episode is called “Promoting a New Product.”  It’s a  dialogue between Zoila and Leo using vocabulary that would be associated, or rela ted to promoting or trying to sell a new business product.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Zoila:  I haven’t seen you around lately.  What have you been up to?

Leo:  My business partners and I have been putting the fi nal touches on our new line of energy drinks.

Zoila:  Really?  I didn’t even know that you were in t he beverage business.

Leo:  Yeah, we’ve branched out into a few other area s.  We’re going to start promoting the new drinks very soon.  We’re working with an advertising agency and we’ll start with sponsoring a couple of sporting even ts.

Zoila:  Wow, when am I going to start seeing ads on TV ?

Leo:  I don’t think we’re going to go that route just  yet.

Zoila:  Are you taking the new products to trade shows?

Leo:  No, no trade shows for us.  We’re working on prod uct placement in some music videos and maybe a TV show or two.

 Zoila:  That’s great.  What about tie-ins with other  products or with a movie?  I see those everywhere.

Leo:  We’re considering it.  We’re working on a couple  of endorsement deals right now.  Once we have some celebrities on board, we’l l do even more.

Zoila:  It would be great if you could get Jeff McQuill an to endorse your products. Everybody knows he’s the greatest baseball player who ever l ived.  With him plugging your energy drinks, sales will go through the ro of.

Leo:  Yeah, but I think we’d be shooting too high.  W e might have to settle for someone a little less famous – like David Beckham or Lance Armstrong.

Our dialogue begins with Zoila saying, “I haven’t seen yo u around lately.  What have you been up to?” meaning what have you been doing.   Leo says, “My business partners and I have been putting the final tou ches on our new line of energy drinks.”  Leo has a business, and the people who ow n the business with him are called his “business partners.”  They’ve been put ting the final touches on something.  “To put the final touches on (something)” m eans to do the last, usually minor things that you need to finish a project, t o complete the final steps of something.  You could say, “I’m writing a report for  my boss.  I’m almost done with it, I just need to put a title on it and put it  in a nice folder,” that would be putting the final touches on it.  Leo and his partners are putting the final touches on their new line of energy drinks.  Here, “line” refe rs to a group of related products that are sold by one company.  Coca-Cola Compan y has a line of soft drinks – of soda pops, or simply “soda.”  Coke, Diet Coke,  etc., those are all part of a group of related products, or a line.  “Line,” h owever, has several different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Well, Leo and his business partners are putting the fina l touches on the new line of energy drinks they have.  “Energy drinks” are drinks that  give you more energy, often have a lot of caffeine in them.  College  students sometimes use energy drinks when they need to study for an exam late at  night, especially when they should have been studying in the past and they wait u ntil the last minute.

Zoila says, “Really?  I didn’t even know that you were i n the beverage business.” A “beverage” is a drink.  Coffee is a beverage; alcohol i s a beverage; tea is a beverage.  At a restaurant, usually, the word that you use for the things that you

 are going to drink, or want to drink, is beverage.  The  waiter may ask you, “Would you like a beverage?”  Would you like something to drink?

Leo says, “Yeah, we’ve branched out into a few other are as.”  His company has branched out.  “To branch out” is a phrasal verb meaning  to expand into different areas or fields, to grow into some sort of new operatio n – new kind of business. The word “branch” comes from the part of the tree; we  call the parts of the tree that go out from the main section of the tree “branch es.”  That main section is called the “trunk.”  Well, Leo is branching out into ne w areas.  He says his company is going to start promoting the new drinks very soo n.  “To promote a product” means to tell other people about it; by telli ng them how good it is, trying to get other people interested so that they will want to buy the product.  We can use “promote” in a business sense for a new product or servi ce.  We also use the word “promote” in a business sense to mean when someone gets a better job. When they go from being vice president to president, we  say they’ve been promoted.

Leo says that he and his business partners are working with an advertising agency and that they will start with sponsoring a couple o f sports events.  An “advertising agency” is a company that specializes in helping  other companies get people interested in buying their product; they may put a commercial on the television, or put an announcement in the newspaper.  T hat’s what an advertising agency does.  Traditionally, the largest advertising agen cies always had an office in New York City on one particular street called Madison  Avenue, and sometimes people will use the words or term Madison Avenue to r efer to advertising companies or people involved in publicity and promotion.

Leo says that they’re going to sponsor a couple of sporting  events.  “To sponsor” means to provide money for an event or a program and yo u, in return, get the opportunity to advertise your product or service to the p eople who are going to that event or program.  Many times a sporting event – a game will be sponsored by a particular company, so everyone who goes the game kn ows that this game was, in part, paid for by that company.  It’s a way of ad vertising, and also a way of showing that you are interested in helping the commu nity perhaps.

Zoila says, “Wow, when am I going to start seeing ads on TV?”  “Ad” is short for advertisement; we also would call those, on television, “co mmercials,” it’s the same thing.  A “commercial” would only be on the TV or the radio; an “ad” could be on TV, radio, or in a magazine or newspaper.  Leo says, “I don’t think we’re going to go that route just yet.”  “To go that route”  means to do that particular thing, to take a specific direction with your actions.  So you could say, “I was thinking about going and getting my master’s degree, bu t I decided not to go that

 route.”  I decided not to do that or those series of things.  Here, Leo is saying that they are not going to be putting commercials, or ads, on  the television.

Zoila then asks, “Are you taking the new products to trade  shows?”  A “trade show” is a large event, usually held in a big auditorium  or hotel, where companies that have similar products get together, typical ly once a year, to show their new products and their new services.  The word “tr ade” here simply refers to the business – the particular business.  So you could have a trade show for dentists, where all the companies that make products for d entists would get together so that other companies, or dentists themselves, co uld go and look and see what there was to buy.  Leo says, “No, no trade shows for us,” meaning we’re not going to any trade shows.  “We’re working on product placement in some music videos and maybe a TV show or two.”  “Product pl acement” is when a company tries to get its product as part of a movie, T V show, or other types of entertainment.  So you could be watching a TV show, an d somebody’s drinking a can of Coca-Cola.  Well, Coca-Cola probably paid the ma kers of that TV program to put their product in that TV program.  This happen s a lot in American television and in American movies.  That’s called product placemen t.

Zoila says, “That’s great.  What about tie-ins with othe r products or with a movie? I see those everywhere.”  A “tie-in” is a connection betw een two or more things, especially when you are trying to sell something related t o a movie or a TV show. So, you could have a famous movie such as Star Wars , and one of the tie-ins could be little dolls – a little doll of Chewbacca for example.  That would be a tie- in to the movie; it is related to the movie.  Leo says, “ We’re considering (tie-ins). We’re working on a couple of endorsement deals right no w.  Once we have some celebrities on board, we’ll do even more.”  An “endor sement” is when a famous person says that they like this product or service, and the y use that person’s name and his picture or part of a video to promote tha t product.  Usually these are famous sports stars, such as the golfer Tiger Woods, or entertainment stars that endorse, or say they like this product, and that, of course, gets other people interested in the product.  At least that’s the idea.  Leo says once they have some “celebrities,” famous people, on board, we’ll do e ven more.  “On board” here means agreeing to participate in something.

Zoila says, “It would be great if you could get Jeff McQui llan to endorse your products.  Everybody knows he’s the greatest baseball player who ever lived. With him plugging your energy drinks, sales will go thro ugh the roof.”  Zoila is suggesting that a very famous baseball player, whose name  is the same as mine, could endorse this product – these energy drinks.  S he says, “ With him plugging your energy drinks, sales will go through the ro of.”  “To plug” means to promote, to endorse, to say that you use this product and  you like it.  When we

 say “sales will go through the roof,” we mean that they will go to a very high amount, and usually go up very quickly.  So if Jeff McQuill an was plugging the product, they would sell a lot of the product very quickly.

Leo says, “Yeah, but I think we’d be shooting too high.  We might have to settle for someone a little less famous – like David Beckham or La nce Armstrong.”  “To shoot too high” means to try to do something that is to o difficult or something that is too out of reach – too advanced, perhaps.  So, they’ re saying here that Jeff McQuillan probably would not want to endorse or plug anything, he’s too famous, so they will have to settle for someone less famous.  “To se ttle for” means to accept something that isn’t your first choice; you really wa nted to have this, but you’ll settle for something a little less, something that  was your third or fourth choice for example.  “Settle” has a couple of different  meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
