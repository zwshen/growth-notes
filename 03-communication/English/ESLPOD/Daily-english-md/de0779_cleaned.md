This episode is a dialogue between Steve and Joyce about giving CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Joyce:  Lie down on the floor.  Steve:  Why?    Joyce:  I have to practice for my CPR exam tomorrow.  I’m taking it so I can get my CPR certification.  Lie down please.  Steve:  Okay, okay.  Now what do I do?  Joyce:  You just lie there and pretend to be unresponsive, like you’re in cardiac arrest.  Okay, I need to determine your heart rate and if you’re breathing or not.  Then, I check to see that your airway isn’t blocked.  Steve:  Hey, get your fingers out of my mouth!  Joyce:  Lie still!  You’re lucky I don’t have to administer artificial respiration.    Steve:  Thank God for small favors!  Joyce:  But I do need to practice restoring your circulation by doing chest compressions.  Steve:  Ouch, that hurts!
