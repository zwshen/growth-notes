This episode is a dialogue about describing how big  something is, as well as the shape of that thing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carson:  Your apartment is going to look fabulous o nce I’m finished decorating it!

Brooke:  I really appreciate you taking the time to  help me choose some furniture, but I’d really like to keep the look conservative a nd traditional.

Carson:  Nonsense!  You have a fabulous new apartme nt and I’m going to help you make the most of it.  Look at that oval mirror.   It’ll look fantastic in your hall.

Brooke:  That mirror is gigantic!  I don’t think I want anything that size.  How about this rectangular one?

Carson:  That’s too puny for that space.  Oh, look at this triangular bookcase.  It would really complement the fireplace in the den.

Brooke:  I don’t think that bookcase is very functi onal.  The shelves are so narrow and it’s an odd shape.  It really looks nice, but I  need furniture that I can actually use.  I like this one better.

Carson:  How boring!  You need something that makes  a statement.  How about this chair?  It’s fabulous!

Brooke:  It’s a humongous circle on the floor with a cushion on top of it.  I don’t think anyone would ever sit on it.

Carson:  Yes, but in design, you have to consider f orm before function.

Brooke:  That’s where we differ.  I actually have to live in this apartment, remember?

Carson begins by saying to Brooke, “Your apartment is going to look fabulous (or wonderful) once I’m finished decorating it!”  “To d ecorate” (decorate) means to make something more attractive, especially a room in a house.  People sometimes talk about “redecorating,” taking a room and changing it, decorating it again.  Putting different colors on the walls, mayb e different furniture, all this could be part of decorating a room.  You could also  decorate a tree, like a Christmas tree, by putting things on it, making it look pretty.

Brooke says, “I really appreciate you taking the ti me to help me choose (or select) some furniture, but I’d really like to keep  the look conservative and traditional.”  Brooke is saying that she wants the room to look traditional – traditional and conservative, she says.  Here it wo uld mean not something with bright or wild colors or crazy looking chairs.  She  wants something that is more like you would typically find in someone’s home, no thing too wild, nothing too crazy, something more conservative – safe.

Carson says, “Nonsense (meaning I don’t agree with you)!  You have a fabulous new apartment and I’m going to help you make the mo st of it.”  The expression “to make the most of (something)” means to do somet hing in order to get the most benefit, the maximum benefit from something.  “I’m going to London and I want to make the most of it.”  I’m going to the Bri tish Museum; I’m going to see all of the great historical sites; I’m going to hav e lunch with the Queen – well, probably not lunch with the Queen!  But, I’m going to make the most of it by doing as much as I can, that’s what Carson means he re.  He says to Brooke, “Look at that oval mirror.”  “Oval” (oval) is a sha pe; it’s like a circle, but a long circle.  It’s sort of the shape of an egg.  It’s ci rcular, it’s round, but it is a little longer, it’s not a perfect circle; that’s oval.  Ca rson and Brooke, I guess, are at some sort of store looking at things to buy for the  apartment.  Carson says that mirror “will look fantastic (wonderful) in your hal l.”  The “hall” is a place in a house usually to get from one place to another – from one  room to another you go through a hall, we sometimes call a “hallway.”  A h all might actually be a small room, especially when you first walk into a house; that’s probably what Carson is talking about here.  I’ll have to ask him!

Brooke says, “That mirror is gigantic!”  “Gigantic”  means very large; we might also say “enormous” or “huge.”  There’s a funny wor d that people have started using more recently, which is “ginormous.”  That’s not a real word in English.  It’s a combination of “gigantic” and “enormous” to mean really, really big.  Brooke says, “I don’t think I want anything that size (mea ning that big).  How about (or what do you think about) this rectangular one?”  “R ectangular” is in the shape of a rectangle, which is something that has 4 90 degre e angles in each corner, so it’s like a square.  A square is a rectangle, but a  rectangle could also be like a longer square, where the four sides are not equal.  In a square, all four sides are equal.  In a rectangle, you have two sides that are  equal, and then two other sides that are equal, but they don’t necessarily eq ual each other in length.  That’s a rectangle.

Carson says that the rectangular mirror is too puny  for that space.  “Puny” (puny) is the opposite of “gigantic,” it’s a way of descri bing the size of something that is very small.  It could also mean something that isn’ t very important or some person who isn’t very important.  But here, it just  means too small.  It’s too small for that space, meaning that area.  He says, “Oh, l ook at this triangular bookcase.”  A “bookcase” is a place where you put b ooks.  “Triangular” refers to the shape of a triangle; it has three straight side s on it.  There are lots of different kinds of triangles.  If you think of the Pythagorea n theorem, the notion that A squared plus B squared equals C squared, then you’l l understand a little bit about triangles, or at least remember a little bit of your geometry, that part of the study of math that looks at things like triangles.  Carson says, “It would really complement the fireplace in the den.”  He’s saying that this triangular bookcase would really complement the fireplace.  “To complem ent” (complement) means to look good next to something or to look good with so mething.  It can here also mean to match; it looks nice with something else be cause it has a similar color or a nice color that “goes with,” we might say, that o ther color.  “Complement” has the word “complete” in it, and that’s one way of re membering what it means.  It means that it goes with or completes something else .  There’s another word, “compliment,” sounds the same but has an “i” in the  middle (compliment), that’s when you say something nice to someone else about their shoes or their hair or how well they did on their geometry test.

Brooke says, “I don’t think that bookcase is very f unctional.”  “To be functional” means that you can actually use it for something; n ot just something that looks pretty – that looks nice, but you can have some pra ctical use from that particular object.  Brooke says, “The shelves are so narrow.”  To say something is “narrow” (narrow) means that it is very thin, it’s not very wide.  We sometimes talk about narrow streets, streets where it’s very difficult to have two cars going in different directions because there isn’t enough room, that wo uld be narrow.  Well, this is a

narrow bookcase.  Brooke also says, “it’s an odd (o dd) shape.”  “Odd” here means unusual, strange, not common.  There are othe r meanings of the word “odd,” take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.  Brooke says that this bookcase that Carson likes really looks nice, but s he needs furniture that she can actually use.  “I like this one better.”  Carson do esn’t like the other one better.  He says, “How boring (how uninteresting)!  You need so mething that makes a statement.”  “To make a statement” here means to ex press yourself in some unusual way, especially when we’re talking about fa shion or design.  You’re doing something that other people will notice; they ’ll go, “Oh, wow!  That’s different.”  They may not like it, but they’ll pay attention to it; that’s making a statement.

Carson says, “How about (what do you think about) t his chair?  It’s fabulous!” Brooke says, “It’s a humongous circle on the floor. ”  “Humongous” (humongous) is a somewhat informal word meaning huge, large, en ormous, gigantic, ginormous, very big.  “A humongous circle” – a “cir cle,” you probably know, is a round shape like an “O,” that’s a circle.  Brooke s ays that this chair is a humongous circle on the floor on the floor with a c ushion on top of it.  A “cushion” (cushion) is another word for a pillow, something that you would sit on on a chair or on a sofa.  Brooke says, “I don’t think anyone w ould ever sit on (this chair).”

Carson says, “Yes, but in design (in the world of d esign and fashion), you have to consider form before function.”  “Form” is the way that something looks, the way that it is designed, how pretty it is for example.  “Function” is how useful or practical it is.  Brooke says, “That’s where we dif fer.”  “To differ” (differ) means to have a different or opposing opinion or view of som ething, or simply to be different from someone or something else, usually in regards to your opinion or your viewpoint about something.  She says, “I actua lly have to live in this apartment, remember?”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
