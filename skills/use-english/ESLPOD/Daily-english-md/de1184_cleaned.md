On this episode, we’re going to hear a story about someone who is very boastful – who likes to talk about how great he is. Let’s ge t started. 

[start of dialogue] 

My boss is a complete blowhard. He likes to boast a bout his accomplishments and acquisitions every chance he gets. Unfortunatel y, I seem to be his favorite audience. 

Boss: You won’t believe what I did over the weekend . I went mountain climbing and skydiving. 

What I wanted to say was, “Uh, spare me!” But what I said instead was, “Oh, really? How exciting.” It doesn’t take much encoura gement to get him going.  

Boss: And I found time to test-drive the new McQ sp orts car yesterday. I’m thinking of buying one. 

Do I really look that gullible? I knew that the bos s didn’t have that kind of money, but I didn’t let it show on my face and simply said , “That’s a very impressive car.” 

Boss: I have my eye on a luxury vacation condo by t he lake. Some lucky girl will get to stay there with me. 

Now I knew he was blowing smoke, but what could I s ay? I just muttered, “Lucky girl,” and left it at that. 

What was the point of all that, unless . . . 

[end of dialogue] 

Our story begins with Lucy saying, “My boss is a co mplete blowhard.” A “blowhard” (blowhard) is a person who likes to talk  about why he is so great, a person who likes to “brag” (brag). “To brag” means to talk about your accomplishments in such a way that you want to impr ess other people. You want other people to know how great you are. “He likes t o boast about his accomplishments and acquisitions every chance he ge ts,” Lucy says.  

Again, she’s talking about her boss who likes “to b oast” (boast). “To boast” means the same as “to brag.” “Accomplishments” (acc omplishments) are things that you have done, good things that you have done because you have worked hard or because of some skill you have. To graduate  from college is an accomplishment. It’s a good thing that you have don e because of your hard work and skill. The boss also likes to boast about his “ acquisitions” (acquisitions).  

“Acquisitions” is just a fancy word for things that  you have bought and now own, or things that you have obtained – perhaps, someone  gave it to you – but usually an acquisition is something that you bought. We usu ally use this word in talking about businesses buying other businesses. The verb is “to acquire” (acquire). Interestingly, we also use this term in language de velopment, in talking about how people acquire languages – how they get new lan guages – and we use the noun “acquisition.” But here, we’re talking about a cquiring or getting things.  

“Every chance he gets” is an expression that means whenever he has the opportunity – at every possible moment. This could refer to something that is good or bad. It could refer simply to how often you  like to go running. “I go running every chance I get,” meaning every opportun ity I can, I go out and I run, or “I like to eat Italian food every chance I get.”  I like to go to an Italian restaurant whenever I have the opportunity. Well, Lucy’s boss “likes to boast about his accomplishments and acquisitions every chance he ge ts.”  

She continues, “Unfortunately, I seem to be his fav orite audience.” An “audience” (audience) is someone who is listening to you or wa tching you. Usually we use the word “audience” to refer to a group of people a t a performance. It might be going to a play, or it could also refer to people w atching a movie in a movie theater – we would call that the “audience” – or pe ople watching the same television program at home. In this case, it simply  means the people who are listening to the boss. Then we hear the boss speak (who sounds a lot like me even though I’m not Lucy’s boss).   

 The boss says, “You won’t believe what I did over t he weekend.” The expression, “You won’t believe” is when you are about to tell s omeone something that is surprising. “I went mountain climbing and skydiving ,” the boss says. “Mountain climbing” (climbing) is when you go up the side of a mountain, usually holding on to the rocks that are part of the mountain in order  to pull yourself up. I’ve never been mountain climbing, but I did try rock climbing  once, which is similar except you go up the side of a rock, not a mountain.  

I tried it for about, oh, 15 minutes. I was with a friend whom I was working with at the university, and her sister – her younger sister , who was very attractive – was visiting her from France, and so we went out to a r ock in the middle of the desert, actually out in what we call the “high desert” here  in Southern California, up by Yucca Valley. We tried to go rock climbing. The you nger sister – now this is before I was married, okay – the younger sister, sh e put on her equipment and she started climbing up, and I thought, “Well, if s he can do it I can do it.”  

So I started to climb up the mountain, climb up the  rock, but here I thought, “Well, I have to be strong.” I have to, you know, impress the girl, right? Make her think that I’m a strong man who can climb rocks. And I ha d never gone rock climbing. The point of the story is, I was terrible at it and  I didn’t get more than, like, 10 feet and, well, she went back to France and I never got her telephone number. Let’s just put it that way.  

Okay, back to the story. The boss went mountain cli mbing and skydiving. “Skydiving” (skydiving) is when you jump out of a p lane and fall down to the earth, but before you actually hit the earth, you o pen a parachute, which is something that catches the air and prevents you fro m killing yourself. And no, I never went skydiving. So, Lucy’s boss is boasting a bout the things he did this weekend.  

She says – to herself, of course – “What I wanted t o say was, ‘Uh, spare me.’” The expression “spare me” means that you don’t want  to hear what the other person has to say. It’s a rude expression. You woul dn’t say it out loud to someone unless you were trying to insult them. We s ay it when someone is telling us something that we don’t believe or that we don’t want to hear.  

Lucy continues, “But what I said instead” – instead  of “spare me” – “was, ‘Oh, really? How exciting.’ It doesn’t take much encoura gement to get him going.” “To get someone going” means to get another person to d o something that they like to do or that you want them to do. It means “to enc ourage” (encourage)  

someone, to get them to do something. In this case,  it was getting the boss to talk more about himself.  

He continues, “And I found time to test drive the n ew McQ sports car yesterday. I’m thinking of buying one.” “To test drive” a car means to go out to a “car dealer,” a business that sells cars, and drive a car to see if you like it or not. Lucy says, “Do I really look that gullible?” “To be gullible” (gullible) means that you are easy to fool. You are easy to trick. It’s easy to make y ou believe something that isn’t true.  

Why does Lucy think that the boss thinks that she’s  gullible? Because, she explains, “I knew that the boss didn’t have that ki nd of money,” meaning he didn’t have enough money to buy a McQ sports car, which is  very expensive, you know. She says, “But I didn’t let it show on my fac e,” meaning I didn’t do something that would make him realize that I knew t hat he was lying.” Instead, she simply said, “That’s an impressive car.”  

The boss continues, “I have my eye on a luxury vaca tion condo by the lake.” “To have your eye (eye) on” something means you are thi nking about buying something. You are interested in it and you’ve been  investigating it. Maybe you’ve been reading the reviews online about it and  thinking about what you would do if you bought it. The boss has his eye on a “luxury” – meaning a very expensive, a very nice – “vacation condo” (condo).  

“Condo” is short for a “condominium.” It’s basicall y an apartment in a building, but you own it. Depending on where you live in the Unit ed States, the word “apartment” is usually just used for a place that y ou are renting. In some cities, perhaps, such as New York, you’ll talk about buying  an apartment. Here in Los Angeles, I think we would say “buying a condo” even  though it might be the exact same thing.  

The boss says, “Some lucky girl will get to stay th ere with me.” Lucy then says to herself, “Now I knew he was blowing smoke.” “To blo w smoke” (smoke) is to exaggerate and perhaps to lie – to say something is  either bigger or better than it actually is, or simply not to tell the truth. “What  could I say,” she says, “I just muttered, ‘Lucky girl,’ and left it at that.” “To m utter” (mutter) means to say something quietly so that the other person doesn’t actually hear you. You say it to yourself even though you say it out loud.  

Lucy obviously doesn’t think that any girl that wou ld be with her boss is lucky. So she’s being sarcastic when she says “Lucky girl.” S he says she “left it at that.” “To leave it at that” is a phrase we use to mean, “ I’m not going to say anything  

else even though I could.” Even though there’s more  I could say, I’m going to stop talking about it right now. At the very end of  the story, she wonders why the boss is boasting to her like this.  

Then she perhaps realizes. She says, “What was the point of all that? Unless . . .” The “point” (point) is the purpose, the meaning.  She’s beginning to realize that perhaps the boss is trying to get her interested in  him. Perhaps he is, we would say, “hitting on her.” “To hit on a woman” – or man  – means that you are trying to get the person interested in you. You are trying to  get that person to date you. You know, by going rock climbing with them.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
