This episode is a dialogue about going to see a cir cus performance, a place where you can see animals and people doing all sort s of interesting tricks. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paula: Ta-da! We’re here. This is your big surprise .

Roman: We’re going to the circus?

Paula: You got it in one! It’s going to be great. T here’ll be clowns and acrobats, trapeze artists and lion tamers.

Roman: I haven’t been to the circus since I was a k id.

Paula: That’s the point. I thought this would be a nostalgic experience for both of us, and let us feel like kids again.

Roman: I’m not sure . . .

Paula: Come on! We’ll miss the first act. I think t here’ll be jugglers, magicians, and tightrope walkers, too.

Roman: Great.

Paula: Listen! I can hear the ringmaster from here.  Let’s go!

Roman: When you said that you had a surprise for me  that would make me feel young again, this wasn’t exactly what I envisioned.

Paula: I know. It’s even better, right?

Roman: If you say so.

Paula begins our dialogue by saying, “Ta-da! We’re here.” That expression, “Ta- da!” (ta da) – two words – is used when you are exc ited and proud to show another person something. You are introducing somet hing to another person – something you're excited about or something, perhap s, you are presenting them as a gift. Paula says, “We’re here. This is your bi g surprise.” So, Paula’s surprise – her gift, if you will – is the place where she ha s taken Roman.

Roman says, “We’re going to the circus?” A “circus”  (circus) is a type of live entertainment where you go and watch people – we wo uld call them “performers” – and trained animals do certain tricks, often thin gs that are dangerous or things that seem unusual. A circus may have lions that do certain tricks. A circus may have someone who is walking on a wire that is suspe nded way up high – what we call, in fact, a “high wire” or a “tightrope.” A ll of these things could be found at a circus, in addition to many other kinds of entert aining performances.

Circuses are popular with children, and many of the  things that you will see at a circus are designed to entertain children. Circuses , at least here in the United States, typically travel from one city or one town to another, and they’ll stay for maybe three or four days, maybe a week or two. When  I was growing up, in the 1970s, back in St. Paul, Minnesota, we would have a  circus that would come to town that would arrive to the city at least once a year and would stay for a couple of weeks. You could go and watch the show, watch the circus performances, in a large auditorium.

Roman asks Paula, “We’re going to the circus?” Paul a says, “You got it in one.” The expression “to get it in one” (one) means to gu ess something correctly the first time – not to need another guess, to get it r ight on the first attempt. Paula says, “It's going to be great. There'll be clowns a nd acrobats, trapeze artists and lion tamers.” Paula lists some of the things you se e, typically, at a circus. We've already mentioned a few of these.

One thing you will always see at a circus is a “clo wn” (clown). A “clown” is a person who dresses in a large outfit, a large unifo rm that's usually very colorful, that has a lot of bright colors. “Clowns” often hav e big red noses on their face and big shoes that they wear. Clowns also often hav e a big wig – fake hair,

basically – that they wear. That's also very colorf ul. Clowns are very popular among small children. They are used to entertain sm all children.

An “acrobat” (acrobat) has nothing to do with your computer or reading PDF files. An “acrobat” is a person who uses their body in an unusual way, similar to a gymnast, but often does things in the air. They do a lot of things that involve jumping or going up high into the air. A “trapeze ( trapeze) artist” is a performer who entertains people by flying through the air, us ually jumping from one bar or one rope to another. “Trapeze artists” do things th at may be very dangerous because they could fall, although usually in a circ us there will be something called a “net” (net) that is put below them to catc h them so they don't hit the floor if they fall.

A “lion (lion) tamer (tamer)” is a person who train s animals – in this case, a lion – to do certain tricks. The word “tamer” comes from t he verb “to tame” (tame), which means to take a wild animal and basically cal m it down, make it so that it will not kill anyone or hurt anyone, especially whe n you're talking about a lion. A lion, of course, is a large cat and, like all cats,  can be very dangerous. I recommend staying away from lions and other cats.

Roman says, “I haven't been to the circus since I w as a kid.” A “kid” (kid) is a young child. This, of course, is not unusual. Peopl e go to circuses usually when they are young, when they are young children – unle ss, of course, you're the parent taking a child to the circus. Roman is a lit tle surprised, I guess, that Paula is taking him to a circus. Paula says, however, “Th at's the point.” She’s saying, “Exactly. That's why I'm bringing you here.”

“I thought this would be a nostalgic experience for  both of us, and let us feel like kids again.” The word “nostalgic” (nostalgic) means  being filled with strong emotions, strong feelings, especially when thinking  about something in the past, when reflecting on your memories. When we say somet hing is “nostalgic,” there’s also a sense that we want to go back in time. We wa nt to return to that time when a certain thing was popular or when we experienced a certain positive thing.

Paula wants this trip to the circus to be a nostalg ic one and let her and Roman “feel like kids again” – to feel as though they wer e young children. That’s something I honestly never really want to do, is to  feel like a young child again. I know I had a happy childhood. I'm not saying there was anything bad about when I was growing up, but there were a lot of things th at weren’t very fun about being a child. So, honestly, I’ve never much had a feelin g about wanting to be a kid again. I'd like to be 20 years old again. That's di fferent.

Roman is also expressing some doubts. He says, “I'm  not sure,” meaning “I'm not sure I want to go to the circus.” Paula, howeve r, insists. She says, “Come on!” meaning let's go. “We’ll miss the first act.” An “act” (act) here refers to a part of a performance, a section of a performance. The f irst act would be the first part of some performance. It could be a play. It could b e, as in this example, a circus. She says, “We’ll miss the first act” – if we don't go now, we will miss the first act. That's why she's trying to hurry Roman up.

Then Paula lists some other things you will see at a circus. She says, “I think there'll be jugglers, magicians, and tightrope walk ers, too.” A “juggler” (juggler) is a person who can keep several objects in the air at  the same time by throwing them up and catching them and throwing them up agai n. A “magician” (magician) is a person who uses what we would call “illusions”  to make you think something is going on even though it really isn't. That’s sor t of what a politician does, I think.

A “tightrope walker” is a person who walks on a hig h wire, or a rope that is very high up in the air. We mentioned this previously. “ Tightrope” (tightrope) is what you call that wire, that rope that the person walks  on. Roman says, “Great.” But he says “great” not to indicate that he's happy, bu t to indicate that he's not very excited about it. He uses the word “great,” but he’ s making a joke. He doesn't think it's great. Paula says, “Listen, I can hear t he ringmaster from here. Let's go!” The “ringmaster” (ringmaster) is basically the  leader of the circus, the person who talks to the audience and who directs the perfo rmers to do what they're supposed to do, or at least when they're supposed to do it.

Obviously, Paula is more excited about this than Ro man. Roman says, “When you said you had a surprise for me that would make me feel young again, this wasn't exactly what I envisioned.” It's not what I was thinking about. Paula says, “I know. It's even better, right?” Roman says, “If you say so.” Paula is saying that going to the circus is the best thing that she coul d have given Roman to make him feel young, but Roman doesn't agree.

He ends by saying, “If you say so.” “If you say so”  is a phrase we use when you do not believe or agree with what another person is  saying, but you're willing to pretend it's true because you don't want to argue a bout it. You don't want to fight about it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paula: Ta-da! We’re here. This is your big surprise .

 Roman: We’re going to the circus?

Paula: You got it in one! It’s going to be great. T here’ll be clowns and acrobats, trapeze artists and lion tamers.

Roman: I haven’t been to the circus since I was a k id.

Roman: Great.

Paula: Listen! I can hear the ringmaster from here.  Let’s go!

Paula: I know. It’s even better, right?

Roman: If you say so.

The ringmaster of the ESLPod circus is our very own  scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse. She's not a clown, but she is a magician when it co mes to words.
