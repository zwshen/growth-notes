This episode is a dialogue between Allen and Monica  about a dangerous storm, when you have very bad weather. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialog] 

Allen:  Are you all right? 

Monica:  Yes, we’re fine, but that blizzard really caught us off guard, especially this time of year.  Have you seen the news? 

Allen:  I just watched it.  Overnight, the storm fe lled over 30 trees in and around the town and toppled utility lines.  City officials  are saying that some residents may not get their electricity restored until the we ekend.   

Monica:  That’s terrible, especially with these uns easonably cold temperatures.  I heard the ferocious storm last night, but I didn’t expect that homes would actually be in danger of washing away.   

Allen:  I don’t know if any will actually be washed  away unless we continue to get steady rain and snow, but those downed trees wrecke d plenty of homes.  It’ll take months for us to fully recover from this storm. 

Monica:  They’re calling it “The Storm of the Centu ry.” 

Allen:  Well, if we just get one of these storms th is century, then that’s more than enough!

Allen says to Monica, “Are you all right?” Are you okay? Monica says, “Yes, we’re fine, but that blizzard really caught us off guard,  especially this time of year.” Apparently Allen is talking to Monica on the teleph one. Monica says, “We’re fine.” We’re okay. “But that blizzard really caught us off  guard.” A “blizzard” (blizzard) is a very strong storm, with a lot of cold air and fas t-moving wind and most importantly a lot of snow. A blizzard is when it's snowing and the wind is blowing very hard, so you can't see as you walk outside bec ause there's so much snow. Monica said the blizzard really “caught us off guar d.” “To catch someone off guard” – “caught” is the past tense of “catch” – me ans for something to happen when a person is not expecting it and is completely  unprepared for it. I was caught off guard when my girlfriend told me that sh e was leaving me for another man. I was caught off guard. I was completely surpr ised. And isn't that the way it typically is? Right, guys?  

Well, Monica was caught off guard by this blizzard.  She asks Allen if he’s seen the news – the newspapers or the news reports on te levision. Allen says, “I just watched it.” I just watched it on television. “Over night”- through the night or during the night – “the storm felled over thirty tr ees in and around town and toppled utility lines.” “To fell” (fell) means to m ake a tree fall down, usually by cutting the tree down, but if you have very strong winds, you could also have trees that fall down from the wind. Allen says the storm also toppled utility lines. “To topple” (topple) means to knock something over,  to knock something down.  

A utility line is also called a power line. These a re long cables, long wires that carry electricity and Internet and telephone signal s and other electronic information from your house, or your building, to s ome other place. So, if you have electricity in your home or in your office, th ere must be some sort of line that connects the power from the city or the local power plant to your house. We would call that a utility line. Utility lines, at l east, traditionally in the United States, were always put up on very tall poles. Now, in many  places they bury the utility lines in the ground but traditionally and still in most places, in my neighborhood, for example, the utility lines are up on tall poles . That's the case in our story as well.  

Allen says, “City officials are saying that some re sidents may not get their electricity restored until the weekend.” A “residen t” is someone who lives in a particular area. I'm a resident of Los Angeles. I'm  a resident of California. In the United States, the place where you are a resident, where you live permanently, is the place where you can vote, where you get your dr iver’s license, where you pay your taxes and so forth. “City officials,” acco rding to Allen, “are saying that some residents may not get their electricity restor ed until the weekend.” “To restore” (restore) means to bring something back th at perhaps has gone away, or  

was damaged. We’re going to restore this old buildi ng. It's falling apart. It's not the way it used to be. We’re going to make it the w ay it used to be. We’re going to bring it back to the condition that it used to b e in. That's “to restore.” “To restore someone's electricity” would mean to give t hem back electricity that has been taken from them or that has not been delivered  to them in this case, because of the toppled utility lines.  

Monica says, “That's terrible, especially with thes e unseasonably cold temperatures.” Something that is “unseasonably” is something that doesn't normally happen during this time of year. We’re ref erring specifically to the weather. We describe whether as unseasonable if, fo r example, it's in the middle of the summer time and it's very cold or if it's in  the middle of the winter and it's very hot. That would be unseasonable weather – weat her that doesn't normally happen during that time of year that season. There are, of course, four seasons – summer, fall, winter, spring – summer, fall, winter , spring. 

Monica says, “I heard the ferocious storm last nigh t.” “Ferocious” (ferocious) is an adjective, typically used to describe someone who's  very angry and perhaps very dangerous with a lot of energy. Here it describes a  very strong storm, a storm that is causing a lot of damage. Monica says that s he didn't expect that homes would actually be in danger of “washing away.”  

Okay, this is quite a storm. It probably is a storm  that has affected different parts of the country and so, it has different manifestati ons, different ways of showing itself, if you will. Monica describes the storm fir st as a blizzard. But then we also hear that utility lines were toppled, which could h appen in a blizzard with strong winds. Now, however, she's talking about homes bein g washed away. “To wash away” means to be removed from where they are by a strong force of water. A river, for example, if it gets too much water in it , could wash away the houses on either side of it. The force of the water could pus h the houses into the river. That would be “to wash away.” Usually the term “wash awa y” is used when talking about a “food” (flood). A flood is when you have to o much water in a river and in the case that I just described, that would be a flo od.  

Here, Monica is talking about houses being washed a way, but of course that wouldn't be possible if it was a blizzard, unless s he's talking about the storm that first went through the southern part of the United States and then the northern part, or first, the northern part and then the sout hern part. That's possible. You could have rain in one area of the country and snow , where it’s colder, in another area of the country and that does sometimes happen.   

Allen says, “I don't know if any will actually be w ashed away,” any homes, that is – “unless we continue to get steady rain and snow.”  “Steady” (steady) means consistent or constant, without any interruption, w ithout a pause – something that happens over a long period of time without stopping . That would be steady. Allen is talking about steady rain and snow. “But,” he sa ys, “those downed trees wrecked plenty of homes.” “To down a tree” is the s ame as “to fell a tree.” So, a “downed tree” is a fallen tree, a tree that has bee n knocked down either because it was cut down or because the wind blew it down. “ To wreck” (wreck) means to ruin, to destroy, to damage something. Allen is say ing that the trees fell on the houses and damaged the house.  

This happened to me once. We had a bad storm, a lot  of wind and part of the tree in front of my house fell on my house and fort unately, there was no damage. It didn't wreck my house.  

Allen says, “It'll take months for us to fully reco ver from this storm.” “To recover” means something similar to restore. It means to ret urn to the original condition after something has been damaged or injured. We oft en talk about recover when dealing with someone who's sick or ill. We hope the y will “recover.” We hope they will get better. Monica says, “They're calling it t he storm of the century.” This is a phrase that the newspapers and news programs on tel evision like to use – “storm of the century.” Whenever you have a big storm, if it's a really big storm, the newspapers will say “It's the storm of the century, ” meaning the most important or biggest storm in a hundred years. That is almost ce rtainly not true in most cases of course. There can only be one storm that was big ger than all the others, but every year or two, we hear this description of some thing being the storm of the century when usually it isn't.  

You'll also hear people talk about the “crime of th e century,” when someone is murdered or there's some serious or terrible crime.  Someone will call it “the crime of the century,” as if it were the worst crime in a  hundred years.  

Allen says, “Well, if we just get one of these stor ms this century, then that's more than enough.” Something that is “more than enough” is something that is too much, more than what you want, or more than what yo u need.  

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a norm al speed  

[start of dialog] 

Allen:  Are you all right? 

Monica:  Yes, we’re fine, but that blizzard really caught us off guard, especially this time of year.  Have you seen the news?

Monica:  They’re calling it “The Storm of the Centu ry.” 

Allen:  Well, if we just get one of these storms th is century, then that’s more than enough!
