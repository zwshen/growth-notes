This episode is a dialogue between Carla and Reuben  about being safe as you are walking down the street. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rueben: I never imagined walking our daughter to sc hool could be so dangerous.

Carla: What happened?

Rueben: We were walking on the sidewalk approaching  the intersection. The crossing guard was there to stop traffic so we coul d cross the street. We were halfway through the designated crosswalk when a guy  driving like a demon whips around the corner.

Carla: And he didn’t stop at the stop sign?

Rueben: No, he didn’t even slow down.

Carla: Didn’t he see the crossing guard or the othe r pedestrians?

Rueben: There are several big trees there, so it’s a blind corner with limited visibility.

Carla: Still, he should have stopped. Was anyone hu rt?

Rueben: No, we were able to get out of his way, but  he could have easily taken out five or six people!

Carla: That’s crazy. What we need are flashing cros swalk signs. Maybe that would get drivers’ attention.

Rueben: And maybe armor for our daughter, too?

Reuben begins by saying, “I never imagined walking our daughter to school could be so dangerous.” “I never imagined” means it  had never occurred to me, or I had never thought. Reuben says walking their d aughter to school is “dangerous” (dangerous). “Dangerous” is unsafe – so mething that is risky, something that could hurt you or injure you or poss ibly even kill you. Carla asks, “What happened?”

Reuben says, “We,” meaning he and his daughter, “we re walking on the sidewalk approaching the intersection.” A “sidewalk” (sidewa lk) is a narrow area next to a street usually made of concrete, though it could be  made of asphalt or some other material, where people can walk safely so the y don’t get hit by the cars in the street. The sidewalks are not in the street, th ey’re next to the street. In most American cities, the sidewalks are actually a coupl e of inches higher than the street. Reuben says that he and his daughter a walk ing on the sidewalk approaching the “intersection” (intersection).

An intersection is where two or more streets cross each other, where they meet. “The crossing guard,” says Reuben, “was there to st op traffic so we could cross the street.” Many times, schools will have people c alled “crossing guards” who work at the intersections during the hours in which  children are walking to school or walking home from school in order to stop the ca rs so that the children can cross the street – go from one side of the street t o the other – safely. We call these people “crossing guards” (guard).

“Crossing” comes, of course, from the verb “to cros s,” which here means to go from one side of the street to the other. Here in L os Angeles, you’ll often see crossing guards, and they’re almost always adults w ho are paid to be there for a couple of hours every day, usually, in order to hel p the children cross the street.

When I was growing up, the older children worked as  crossing guards. They would take the children, the younger children, and walk with them, and they would have “flags” – pieces of plastic, I remember them being – on long poles that they would hold out and indicate to the cars t hat they should stop so that the children could walk across the street. This, of cou rse, was usually on corners or intersections where there was no traffic signal, no  electronic signal to stop cars.

 Anyway, the people in my school were called “police  patrols” (patrols). A “police patrol” was a sixth grade student who helped the yo unger students – usually grades one, two, and three – to get home safely fro m school. This was also in a neighborhood where most of the children walked to s chool. This isn’t always the case nowadays, especially in Los Angeles, where the  schools are farther away from children in many cases, and so they have to ta ke a bus. But when they do walk, there are often crossing guards at the corner s near the school so the children can get across the street safely.

Reuben says, “The crossing guard was there to stop traffic so we could cross the street.” “Traffic” (traffic) here just refers to the cars that are moving down the street. Reuben continues, “We were halfway through the designated crosswalk when a guy driving like a demon whips around the co rner.” A “crosswalk” (crosswalk) is an area on the street that has two w hite lines and there is room in between the white lines for people to walk. A cross walk is a place where you as a person walking on the street, especially a busy str eet, are supposed to cross.

Cars are supposed to stop if there is someone in the crosswalk. If there’s someone walking across the street in the crosswalk,  the cars are supposed to stop. Now, not all cars do stop, but the law in mos t places says that if you are in the crosswalk, walking across the street, the cars have to stop for you even if the crosswalk is not at an intersection, even if it’s i n the middle of a block, which sometimes happens if there are very long blocks – t hat is, long distances between intersections.

A “designated crosswalk” is just a crosswalk that h as been painted and often has a sign next to it that says “crosswalk” so that dri vers can see that there is a crosswalk there on the street. Reuben says he and h is daughter were “halfway through the designated crosswalk,” meaning they wer e in the middle of the street, “when a guy” – a driver – “driving like a d emon whipped around the corner.”

The word “demon” (demon) here refers technically to  some sort of evil person or evil spirit. Here it probably just means something like a crazy person or a person who wasn’t driving very carefully. “To whip” (whip)  here means to move very rapidly, so “to whip around the corner” means to tu rn the corner – to go from one street to the intersecting street, or the street th at crosses the street that you are on.

Carla says, “And he didn’t stop at the stop sign?” Some intersections have stop signs, which is usually a red sign that has white l etters that say – surprise,

surprise – “Stop.” Other intersections have traffic  lights. These are lights – red, yellow, and green – that indicate whether you shoul d stop or go. Of course, in most big cities, most intersections don’t have stop  signs or traffic lights. You’re just supposed to slow down at the intersections and  the first person to the intersection gets to go first.

Well, anyway, in this story, Carla is surprised tha t this driver didn’t stop at the stop sign, which of course the driver should have. That’s the law in most American cities. Reuben says, “No, he didn’t even s low down.” He didn’t even decrease his speed. Carla said, “Didn’t he see the crossing guard or the other pedestrians?” A “pedestrian” (pedestrian) is anothe r name for a person who is walking – someone who is not in a car or on a motor cycle but who is outside walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.

Reuben says, “There are several big trees there, so  it’s a blind corner with limited visibility.” A “corner” (corner) is another word for an intersection where two streets cross, two or more streets cross. A “blind (blind) corner” is a corner where, as you’re driving down one street, you canno t see the cars coming on the other street – perhaps there’s a building there, or  in this case, there are several big trees there. Because of the big trees, there is  “limited visibility” (visibility). “Visibility” means the ability to see.

So, if there is “limited visibility,” there is not an easy way for you to see, or it is difficult for you to see. Carla says, “Still, he sh ould have stopped. Was anyone hurt?” Reuben says, “No, we were able to get out of  his way.” “To get out of someone’s way” means to move in order to avoid bein g hit by another person – perhaps that person is walking or perhaps that pers on is driving a car, as was the case here in this dialogue.

Reuben says, “He could have easily taken out five o r six people!” The phrasal verb “to take out” can mean a lot of different thin gs. Here, it means to kill someone. If the car had “taken out” five or six peo ple, the car would have hit and killed five or six people. “To take out” can also m ean to go to a restaurant and pick up your food – we call that “takeout food” as a noun, and the verb would be “to take out.”

“To take out” can also mean simply to remove. We us ually use that phrasal verb in that sense, when we’re talking about the garbage  or trash in your house. “I have to take out the trash” (trash). That means I h ave to take the junk inside my house that I no longer want and bring it outside, u sually to put it in another container  – what we would call a “bin” (bin), a “t rash bin” – and then later take

the trash bin out to the street so that someone can  come and take the trash away. But here, “to take out” means to kill.

Carla says, “That’s crazy. What we need are flashin g crosswalk signs.” “Flashing” (flashing) is when a light turns on and off repeatedly – on and off, on and off, on and off. That would be “flashing.” “To flash” has some other interesting meanings, but we won’t talk about those  today. You can look at the Learning Guide for those. Carla says that they need  “flashing crosswalk signs” – that is, signs on the side of the road that not onl y indicate that there is a crosswalk on the street, but have lights flashing s o that you notice the signs. “Maybe that would get drivers’ attention,” she says .

Then Reuben jokes at the end, “And maybe armor for our daughter, too?” “Armor” (armor) is a word you don’t see a lot anymo re. It’s basically a heavy metal covering that is worn for protection. We asso ciate it with medieval days, of knights fighting in a battle, and they would have s pecial clothing that would protect them from swords and other arms that the ot her soldiers would try to injure them with.

That’s why we know Reuben is making a joke here. He ’s not actually suggesting that his daughter go out with metal clothing on so that she doesn’t get hurt, though here in Los Angeles, it might not be a bad i dea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
