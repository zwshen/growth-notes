This episode is a dialog about advertising, or havi ng commercial advertisements in the world of television and movies. Let’s get st arted. 

[start of dialog] 

Victoria:  [clears her throat]  Congratulations are  in order.  I just scored a product placement for our brand in the latest McQuillanator  movie.  Thank you, thank you very much. 

Gerard:  Really?  That’s great!  Will it have a pro minent place in the movie? 

Victoria:  Well, you know how these things are.  Ou r logo goes by in the blink of an eye, but millions of people are going to see it.    

Gerard:  So will the star be wearing our logo on hi s shirt or something? 

Victoria:  Something like that. 

Gerard:  But not that.   

Victoria:  No, it’s a little more subtle than that,  but it’ll be embedded into an important scene. 

Gerard:  But where are they going to see it? 

Victoria:  Is that really important?  The important  thing is that our brand will be associated with a major Hollywood movie.  What more  could we ask for? 

Gerard:  Stop beating around the bush.  Where in th e movie will our logo appear? 

Victoria:  All right.  It’ll be on the bottom of th e star’s shoes, on the sole, and the audience will be able to see it when he’s running. 

Gerard:  Only if he’s running in slow motion, but h e won’t be, right?  If it goes by that quickly, it’ll be more like subliminal adverti sing. 

Victoria:  Exactly! I hadn’t thought of it that way , but hordes of people will be going out to buy our products and they won’t even k now why.  I’m even more of a genius than I thought! 

[end of dialog] 

Victoria begins by clearing her throat. “To clear y our throat” is to do this [clears throat)]. You are making a low sound, almost like a  cough, to get rid of anything that's in your throat that would prevent you from b eing heard clearly. I clear my throat before I record often.  

Victoria begins by saying, “Congratulations are in order.” “To congratulate (congratulate) someone” means to say they've done a  good job, to give them your best wishes after they have accomplished somet hing. Someone who wins a race or wins a competition will be congratulated by  other people – “Good job!” “Congratulations!” “Congratulations are in order” i s a phrase used when you are talking to a group of people, typically, and you wa nt to congratulate one person. You want to announce some achievement or accomplish ment by this person, and tell him what a good job he did.  

Victoria says, “I just scored a product placement f or our brand in the latest McQuillanator movie.” We learn immediately then tha t Victoria is congratulating herself or telling other people to congratulate her  because she's accomplished something. We don't normally ask other people to co ngratulate us, but Victoria does. This is Hollywood, after all.  

She says “I just scored a product placement.” “To s core” here means to get or to obtain something that is very good. “I scored us tw o tickets to the Bruce Springsteen concert.” I was able to get, I was able  to buy, I was able to obtain, two tickets. “Product placement” is when a company' s product appears usually in a television show or a movie. So, if you're watchin g a TV show like “Friends” or “24,” and you see somebody drinking a can of Coca-C ola, or drinking from a can of Coca-Cola, that would be an example of product p lacement. Usually the company pays to have its product in the movie or in  the television program.  

Victoria scored a product placement for our “brand, ” she says. A “brand” (brand) is a type of product or related products that are s old under a single name. Coca- Cola is a brand name. It's the name of a group of p roducts that are similar. Victoria scored a product placement for the company 's brand in the latest McQuillanator movie. (And if you haven't seen the l atest, the most recent, McQuillanator movie, I think you'll like it!) Victo ria says “Thank you. Thank you very much.” She sort of making a joke. She's congra tulating herself.  

Gerard says, “Really? That’s great. Will it have a prominent place in the show?” “Prominent” means important or easily seen, easily noticed, so that people will see it easily. Victoria says, “Well, you know how t hese things are,” which means “you understand this kind of situation.” “Our logo goes by in the blink of an eye, but millions of people are going to see it.” A “log o” (logo) is a small image that represents the company. The expression “in the blin k of an eye” means very quickly, almost without noticing it.  

Victoria said the logo goes by “in the blink of an eye, but millions of people will see it.” Gerard says, “So, will the star be wearing  our logo on his shirt or something?” He's asking if the main actor in this m ovie will be wearing something that has the logo of the company on his shirt. Vict oria says, “Something like that,” meaning “Well not exactly, but something similar to  that.” Gerard says “But not that ,” meaning not that exact thing I just said, wearin g the logo on his shirt. Victoria says, “No. It's a little more subtle than that.” “To be subtle” (subtle) means not obvious, not easily noticed, something th at is there but you may have to look for it.  

Victoria says, “The logo will be embedded into an i mportant scene.” “To embed” (embed) means to put something inside of something else, almost to become part of it. The logo, then, will be embedded into a n important scene, an important part of the movie. Gerard says, “But where are they  going to see it?” Where are they going to see our logo, the thing that represen ts our company? Victoria says, “Is that really important? The important thing is t hat our brand will be associated with a major Hollywood movie.” “To be associated wi th” means to be connected to, to be related to. Their brand is going to be re lated or connected to a major, or very important, Hollywood movie. “What more could w e ask for?” That question means “What could be better than this situation?” T he idea of course, is nothing. 

Gerard says, “Stop beating around the bush.” The ex pression “to beat (beat) around the bush (bush)” means to be very indirect i n describing something or telling someone about something. You're trying to a void saying exactly what you're talking about. “To beat around the bush” is always a bad thing. It's a negative way of describing what someone is doing in  talking to you.   

 Gerard says, “Where in the movie will our logo appe ar?” In what part of the movie will we see our logo? Victoria replies, “All right. It will be on the bottom of the star’s shoes, on the sole, and the audience wil l be able to see it when he's running.” The bottom of your shoe is called the “so le (sole)” of your shoe. Of course, usually you can't see the bottom of someone 's shoes. Victoria says that the logo will be on the sole of the shoe and people  will see it when the star, the main character in the movie, is running with these shoes.  

Gerard says, “Only if he's running in slow motion, but he won't be right?” “Slow motion” refers to playing a video recording at a sl ower speed so that it looks like the people are moving and talking very slowly – lik e our podcast English in slow motion. Gerard says, “But if it goes by that quickl y, it will be more like subliminal advertising.” “Subliminal (subliminal) advertising”  is advertising where the message only appears on the TV or movie screen very  quickly, for less than a second. The idea is that people see the image, the message, and their brain captures it but they're not aware that they saw tha t message. That's called subliminal advertising. 

Victoria says, “Exactly. I hadn't thought of it tha t way,” – in that manner – “but hordes of people will be going out to buy our produ cts and they won't even know why.” Once again, the idea of subliminal advertisin g is that people get an idea, but they don't know where they saw it because they weren't consciously able to see the message or the image. Victoria is trying to  make the best of a not very good situation by saying that “Oh yes. Our advertis ing will work and hordes of people will be going out to buy our products.”  

“Hordes” means a large group of people, many people . Hordes is a word that you need to pronounce carefully. You need to have the “ d” at the end of hordes otherwise you get the word “whores” which means som ething very different. It means a prostitute. And of course, you don't want t o be talking about prostitutes when you mean a large group of people.  

“I'm even more of a genius than I thought,” Victori a says. A “genius” (genius) is a very smart or intelligent person, someone who is sm arter than the rest of us. In the twentieth century, we often talked about Einste in as being one of the geniuses of science. Victoria says that she is smar ter then she even realized because she has created this subliminal advertising  by putting the logo on the bottom of the star’s shoes. 

Now let's listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.
