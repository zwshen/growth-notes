Our dialogue begins with Hilary – not Hillary Clint on, no relation – Hilary’s saying, “The election is still two months away and I’m alre ady sick of the political ads.” The “election” is the process of selecting someone for a public office typically.  In

a democracy people vote in the election, and the pe rson with the most votes wins.  Hilary, however, says that the election is s till two months away, meaning it’s two months from now.  She’s already sick of the political ads.  “To be sick of (something)” means to be tired of something.  This is different than saying “I’m sick.”  When you say “I’m sick” you mean you are ph ysically ill, there’s something wrong with your body – or perhaps your brain.  I th ink that’s my problem, the brain problem!  Anyway, “to be sick of (something)”  means to be tired of something; you no longer want to hear it or be part  of it.  Hilary is sick of political ads.  “Ads” is short for “advertisements.”  “Politi cal” relates, of course, to typically government offices – government offices and their e lections.  So, “political ads” would be advertisements you would see on the televi sion or hear on the radio, usually about one person who wants to president or senator or whatever the election is about.

Hilary says, “Look at these flyers we got in the ma il just today.”  A “flyer” (flyer) here means a piece of paper that has writing on it,  often some sort of picture or photograph, that’s used to describe either an event , or in this case, a certain political “candidate,” someone who is trying to get  elected to a job – a political job.  Hilary says, “Look at these flyers we got in the mail just today, not to mention the canvassers ringing our doorbell nonstop !”  A “canvasser” (canvasser) is a person who goes from one house to another, knocks on your door, or rings your doorbell, and tries to convince  you to vote for a certain person or perhaps to support a certain political cause.  T he “doorbell” is an electronic device that you can press that makes a noise and th at noise indicates there’s someone at your front door – the front door of your  house or apartment – who wants to get in or to talk to you.  The verb we use  when we make a sound with a bell is “ring,” and so we have the expression “to r ing a doorbell.”  To ring a doorbell “nonstop” would mean continuously, without  stopping, without a break. Anything you do nonstop is something that is done w ithout interruption.  When we talk about airplanes flying from one place to an other nonstop we mean they don’t stop in another city in between, they go dire ctly from one place to another.

Bill – no relation to Bill Clinton – Bill says, “It ’s worse if you watch TV, with attack ad after attack ad.”  An “attack (attack) ad” is a very usually negative political advertisement that criticizes very strongly one of the people in the election; usually one person will be criticizing the other pe rson.  They may be attacking their political positions, or they may be criticizi ng their personal behavior. American elections – unlike some elections in other  countries – is often very influenced by these personal issues.  Bill says, “I t’s gotten completely out of hand.”  The expression “out of hand” (hand) means o ut of control, there’s too much of something, it’s gone too far.  These attack  ads have gotten completely

out of hand, they’ve become too extreme, they’ve be come something that doesn’t have reasonable limits anymore.

Hilary says, “What’s happening to campaign finance reform?”  The expression “campaign finance reform” has three words: “campaig n,” which refers to the process of someone trying to get elected to a polit ical office; “finance,” which refers to money; and “reform,” which refers to tryi ng to change things.  Putting those three words together you get a term that is u sed to describe people’s efforts in the past several years in the U.S. to tr y to make elections more fair. Nowadays if you have a lot of money you have a bett er chance of being elected to a political office.  Campaign finance reform tri ed to equal the contributions, mostly by having the government give candidates mon ey to run for political office or limiting the amount of money you could spend.  I t hasn’t been very successful in the United States, but we won’t talk about that right now.

Hilary’s asking the question, “What happened to cam paign finance reform?  After years of talking about it, we still have lots of po litical action committees using soft money to finance media campaigns.”  Three terms the re: first, “political action committees” are organizations that take their money  and buy advertisements or try to influence the public about either a certain political issue or a certain political candidate, someone who’s trying to become governor or senator or president, whatever the elected office is.  Political action c ommittees are not under control of the person who’s running for president or runnin g for senator – who’s trying to become president, for example; political action com mittees are independent. “Soft money” is money that is donated to a politica l organization, but not directly to the candidate.  So it’s money you would give to a political action committee, which we often refer to by its acronym “PAC.”  You give money to a PAC, and that way you can avoid any legal limits on the amou nt of money you can give directly to a candidate.  Part of campaign finance reform in the United States involves limiting the amount of money any one perso n can give another person to run for office – to try to win an election.  But if  you give money to a PAC, you can avoid that limit; that’s why we call it “soft money ,” it’s easier to move around. “Media campaigns” refer to television advertisement s, Internet advertisements, radio ads; all of those are part of media campaigns .

Bill says, “You can’t even call them media campaign s anymore.  They’re more like smear campaigns.”  “To smear” (smear) as a ver b means to say something false about someone else, to say something bad abou t someone else that is not true, and by doing that you hurt that person’s repu tation.  You make people think that that person is a bad person; that’s to smear s omeone.  So, a “smear campaign” would be an organized, we might say “coor dinated,” effort to try to make another person look bad, especially in a polit ical campaign – in an election

campaign.  Bill says, “I’m fed up with all of this propaganda.”  “To be fed up” is a phrasal verb meaning to be very frustrated, to be t ired of something, to not want to have anything to do with this anymore.  You just  want it to stop.  Bill says he’s fed up with all of this propaganda.  “Propaganda” ( propaganda) is biased information that only gives one side of the story, or one perspective. Governments often use information to try to influen ce people, to create a certain impression, and when that information is either fal se or one-sided – that is, it doesn’t give a proper perspective, a proper view of  the whole situation, we might call that information propaganda.

Hilary says, “You know what we should do?”  Bill sa ys, “What?”  Hilary says, “We should take a vacation until the election is over,”  meaning we should leave, take a vacation until after the election is finished.  “ We should take a vacation until the election is over…in Thailand!” meaning they should go to the country of Thailand, they should leave the country so they would not hav e to hear anything more about the political campaign.  Unfortunately, nowad ays with the Internet it’s almost impossible to escape from the news of your c ountry even when you go to another country.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
