Our episode is called “The Supermarket Checkout.”  Let's go!   [Start of story]  I went to the supermarket to do my weekly shopping.  The cashiers at this market are usually pretty friendly, but this one must have been having a hard day.  Cashier:  Excuse me, sir, this lane is for 15 items or less.  It looks like you have more than that.  Yong:  No, actually I have exactly 15.  I have some coupons, too.    Cashier:  Just put those down on the belt and push the cart through, please.    Yong:  Okay.  Can you tell me how much these potatoes are per pound?  Cashier:  I’ll have to do a price check.  Do you have a club card?  Yong:  Yes, here it is.  Cashier:  Swipe it through the machine, sir.  Your total is $47.52.  Debit or credit?  Yong:  Debit.  Could I get cash back?  Cashier:  [sigh] How much do you want?  Yong:  I’d like $40.
