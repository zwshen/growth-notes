[start of dialogue]

Amin: I can’t stand to be away from Fifi for two we eks. Can’t we bring her along?

Eva: We’ve talked about this before. Our dog does n ot like to travel. We’ll board her.

Amin: What if we get a really big crate or carrier that Fifi will feel comfortable in?

Eva: It won’t make a difference if she’s left out o n a hot tarmac and has to spend hours in cargo hold.

Amin: It’ll be well ventilated and the crate will b e large enough for her to turn around in.

Eva: She’ll still bark and whimper and you know it.  Do you want her to suffer?

Amin: Of course not. What if she can travel in the cabin with us?

Eva: She’s too big.

Amin: We could change our travel plans, drive inste ad of fly.

Eva: We’re not changing our travel plans. She’ll be  fine at the kennel.

Amin: She’ll have separation anxiety.

Eva: Are you talking about the dog or about you?

[end of dialogue]

Amin begins our dialogue by saying to Eva, “I can’t  stand to be away from Fifi for two weeks. Can’t we bring her along?” The expressio n “I can’t stand” means “I am not able to deal with” or “I’m not able to toler ate.” We can use this expression in a lot of different ways. If someone is making a lot of noise next to us, you might say, “I can’t stand the noise you’re making.” That means it really bothers me. It makes me upset. It makes me perhaps angry.

In the dialogue, Amin is saying that he isn’t going  to like to leave Fifi for two weeks. “Fifi,” we learn, is the name of his dog. “C an’t we bring her along?” he asks. “To bring someone along” (along) means to bri ng someone with you, to take someone with you on a trip.

Eva says, “We’ve talked about this before. Our dog does not like to travel. We’ll board her,” she says. “To board” (board) means to p ay someone to take care of your animal, usually a dog, for a certain amount of  time. If you own a dog and you are going to be traveling, you can take it to a  place that will take care of it while you are gone. The verb we would use there wou ld be “to board” the dog. These places are usually called “kennels” (kennels) .

Amin says, “What if we get a really big crate or ca rrier that Fifi will feel comfortable in?” Amin is trying to think of a way t o take the dog with them, so he suggests getting a big “crate” (crate). A crate is a large wooden box. A “carrier” (carrier) is any sort of box that can be lifted up using what we would call “handles” (handles). Handles are basically straps –  pieces of material that are connected to the box that you can use to put your h ands around in order to lift the box up.

Eva says, “It won’t make a difference if she’s left  out on a hot tarmac and has to spend hours in cargo hold.” We’re talking now about  an airplane. When you travel on an airplane, the airplane in the airport is parked on or sits on what’s called a “tarmac” (tarmac). A tarmac is a large are a at the airport that the airplanes drive on or go across on before they go u p in the air. A “cargo (cargo) hold (hold)” is a large area on the bottom of an ai rplane, although it could be in a ship as well, that is used to keep or store suitcas es, boxes, and other large objects.

Eva is saying it won’t be very practical to try to do what Amin is suggesting, but Amin isn’t giving up. He says, “It’ll be well venti lated and the crate will be large enough for her to turn around in.” “Ventilated” (ve ntilated) means having a lot of air going through a certain space or a room. If you  are inside a room, you want

the room to be “well ventilated” – air moving in an d out of it so that you’re not breathing in the same air. The opposite of “ventila ted” would be “stuffy” (stuffy). Amin says that this crate he’s thinking of will be well ventilated and will be large enough for the dog “to turn around in.”

“To turn around” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning  to move 180 degrees in the opposite direction. So, if you are looking north, y ou will turn your body so that you are looking south. The verb we would use here actua lly would be “facing south” and “facing north.” “To face” (face) means to turn your body in a certain direction so that the front of your body, your face, is point ed in a certain direction. Interestingly enough, the verb “to face” can also m ean “to deal with.” We have “to face our problems.” We have to deal with or take ca re of our problems.

Eva says the dog will still “bark and whimper.” “To  bark” (bark) is the verb we use to describe the way a dog makes sound. There’s also  a noun which is “bark.” A dog “barks” – woof, woof. The sound made by a cat i s described by using the verb “to meow” (meow) – meow, meow. That, at least in English, is the sound a cat makes. Cats make different sounds in different languages. It’s very strange, but then again, so are cats, which is why you shoul d never own one.

Eva is saying that even in this crate, the dog is s till going to bark and “whimper” (whimper). “To whimper” is to make a soft sound tha t usually indicates you are sad or scared or perhaps in pain. Eva then asks Ami n, “Do you want her,” meaning the dog, “to suffer?” “To suffer” (suffer) means to experience some sort of pain or to be in a difficult situation or underg oing a difficult experience. Amin says, “Of course not.” He doesn’t want her to suffe r.

Then he says, “What if she can travel in the cabin with us?” The “cabin” (cabin) is the part of an airplane in which the human beings a re located. It’s where you sit in an airplane. The cabin is usually on the top par t of the airplane and the cargo hold is on the bottom part of the airplane. Eva say s, however, that the dog is too big to travel in the cabin with them. Amin says, “W e could change our travel plans, drive instead of fly.” Eva says, “We’re not changing our travel plans. She’ll be fine at the kennel.”

Amin says, “She’ll have separation anxiety.” “Separ ation” (separation) comes from the verb “to separate,” which means to take tw o things and pull them apart or put them apart so that they are not next to each  other. “Anxiety” is a feeling of sadness or fear or perhaps just worry about somethi ng. “Separation anxiety,” then, is the feeling of sadness or fear that you fe el when you are separated from another person.

In this case, Amin thinks the dog will have separat ion anxiety being away from her owners. Eva then asks, “Are you talking about t he dog or about you?” meaning of course that it is Amin who will feel the  separation anxiety because he won’t be near his dog.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
