This episode is a dialogue between Mitch and Nancy about children fighting and acting badly, as children sometimes do. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Mitch: How was work today?

Nancy: Terrible. Nobody could get along and the nam e-calling started early.

Mitch: Did anybody throw a tantrum or act out in so me other way?

Nancy: Several did. At one point, a couple of them stomped out and slammed the door, but they eventually came back. I wish they’d given each other the silent treatment instead.

Mitch: So there was yelling?

Nancy: Lots of yelling. They tried to talk over eac h other and wouldn’t take turns. After a while, I wanted to demand some quiet time, but no one would have paid me any attention.

Mitch: That sounds like a lot of posturing. At leas t it didn’t devolve into hitting and biting.

Nancy: Not yet, but I wouldn’t be surprised if ther e is plenty of that next week when the Congressional subcommittee on peacekeeping  meets again.

Mitch begins our dialogue by asking Nancy, “How was  work today?” He wants to know how Nancy’s day was at work. Nancy responds, “ Terrible,” meaning very bad. “Nobody could get along and the name-calling s tarted early.” The phrasal verb “to get along” (along) means to have a friendl y relationship with another person, to be nice to each other. If you say, “I ge t along with my mother-in-law,” that means you have a friendly relationship with he r. It also means you’re probably a liar.

Nancy also says that “the name-calling started earl y.” “Name-calling” is when you try to hurt another person’s feelings by calling or  using a bad name for him. I won’t give you examples but you probably can think of lots of names or words that you call other people whom you don’t like or w hom you want to anger. Mitch asks, “Did anybody throw a tantrum or act out in so me other way?” The expression “to throw (throw) a tantrum (tantrum)” m eans to lose control of your emotions or your actions – to get very angry or ups et and begin to act in ways that you shouldn’t.

Normally, we associate this expression “throwing a tantrum” with a child, a young child who gets mad and starts yelling or perhaps hi tting other people. If you say that an adult is “throwing a tantrum,” you are real ly insulting that person, saying that that person is acting like a child, because we  only expect children to throw a tantrum. “To act (act) out” is also another express ion that we usually use with children, or to describe the way children act when they are being bad – when they are, we would say, “behaving badly.”

“To behave” (behave) means to act. The title of this episode is “misbehavior,” which refers to people not acting the way they shou ld, or acting badly. “To act out” means to yell or start doing things that show that you are angry. It’s something that children might do when they get upse t. They might start yelling or throwing things or hitting other people. That’s wha t “to act out” means. To be honest, I don’t remember hearing this expression a lot when I was a child. Although in my family, if you misbehaved, my parent s would certainly let you know about it and it would not last very long.

Nancy says that several people threw a tantrum and acted out at her work today. She says, “At one point,” meaning at a certain time , “a couple of them stomped out and slammed the door, but they eventually came back.” The expression “to stomp” (stomp) refers to hitting your feet against the floor loudly. The phrasal verb “to stomp out” means to leave a room by loudly  hitting your feet against the floor. It’s an indication that you’re angry and you ’re leaving because you are angry or upset with someone.

Similarly, “to slam (slam) the door” means to close  the door very loudly, with a lot of force. Again, that usually indicates that you are angry, when you slam the door. Nancy says a couple of people at her work “st omped out and slammed the door, but they eventually,” meaning later, “came ba ck.” “I wish they’d given each other the silent treatment instead,” she says. The phrase “the silent treatment” (treatment) refers to a period of time when two peo ple don’t talk to each other because they are angry with each other. If you’re m arried, you know what I mean.

Mitch says, “So there was yelling?” “Yelling” comes  from the verb “to yell” (yell). “To yell” means to shout, to speak in a very loud v oice, usually because you’re angry. Nancy says, “Lots of yelling,” meaning yes, there was a lot of yelling. “They tried to talk over each other and wouldn’t ta ke turns,” she explains. “To talk over someone” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to  speak while another person is speaking, especially if you want to say s omething and don’t want to listen to the other person.

If you are arguing with another person, you may som etimes talk over that other person – talk when he or she is talking. My wife lo ves it when I talk over her during a discussion. That’s a joke. Nancy says the people at her work “tried to talk over each other and wouldn’t take turns (turns ).” “To take turns” means to allow someone else to do something that you are doi ng. First, I do it, then you do it, then another person does it, then another perso n does it, then I do it, and so forth. That’s “taking turns.” Everyone gets a chanc e or an opportunity to do something – in this case, to talk.

“After a while,” Nancy continues, “I wanted to dema nd some quiet time.” “Quiet time” is a period of silence when no one is allowed  to talk. She says, “No one would have paid me any attention,” however. “To pay  attention” means to do what the other person says to do, or at least to li sten to the other person. Mitch says, “That sounds like a lot of posturing.” The ve rb “to posture” (posture) means to behave or to act in a certain way in order to im press other people, to make other people think a certain way about you, or perh aps even to make other people afraid of you. “To posture” is to act in a c ertain way, to make you seem bigger or stronger or more powerful than you really  are.

Mitch says, “At least it didn’t devolve into hittin g and biting.” The verb “to devolve” (devolve) means to change into something worse. We might also use the verb “to deteriorate” or simply “to worsen” (worsen). Mitch says, “At least it didn’t devolve into hitting (hitting) and biting (biting).” “To hi t” someone is to use a part of your body, such as your hand or perhaps an object, a thi ng, to hurt that person by

moving it with force into that person. Normally, if  you hit someone, you are angry at that person.

“To bite” (bite) means to use your teeth, which are  inside of your mouth, to hurt another person. Normally we bite a piece of food wh en we are eating. You don’t normally bite another person. Once again, that woul d be something perhaps that a child would do. Nancy says, “Not yet,” meaning the people at her work had not yet started hitting and biting, but perhaps they wi ll in the future. In fact, she says, “I wouldn’t be surprised,” meaning it would not sur prise me – it would not be unusual, “if there is plenty of that” – that is, a lot of hitting and biting – “next week when the Congressional subcommittee on peacekeeping  meets again.”

The final line of the dialogue then tells us where Nancy works. She works in Congress. She works in that part of our national or  federal government in Washington, D.C., that is composed of representativ es of the people. A “congressional subcommittee” is a group of people in Congress that are discussing and are responsible for laws about a cer tain topic. This topic in the case of our dialogue is “peacekeeping” (peacekeepin g). “Peace” is the opposite of “war.” “Peacekeeping” means trying to prevent pe ople from fighting.

So of course, the joke in our dialogue here is that  this group of people, this congressional subcommittee on peacekeeping, is in f act a group of people who are always fighting each other and behaving badly.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
