This episode is a dialogue about riding motorcycles  and scooters. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bernadette: When you offered to give me a ride to w ork, I didn’t know you rode a motorcycle. I’m not sure about this.

Pawel: Come on, put on this helmet and get on. You’ ll get to work much faster. We can zip around cars and go between lanes.

Bernadette: That’s what I’m afraid of.

Pawel: I’m an experienced driver. I rode a moped wh en I was a teenager, had a scooter in college, and got my first bike when I wa s 22. I ride with my motorcycle club every weekend, so you don’t have to worry abou t safety.

Bernadette: I’m sure you’re a good driver, but one wrong move and I’m roadkill.

Pawel: Get on and I promise to behave. I won’t pop any wheelies, spin out, or do any other tricks.

Bernadette: If that was intended to put my mind at ease, it didn’t work.

Pawel: All right, last call. You want a ride to wor k or not?

Bernadette: Okay, I’m putting my life in your hands . If I die, it’ll be on your conscience.

Pawel: No worries. If we wipe out, it’ll take us bo th out, so I won’t be conscious to worry about my conscience. Hold on!

Bernadette says to Pawel, “When you offered to give  me a ride to work, I didn’t know you rode a motorcycle. I’m not sure about this .” Bernadette is saying that Pawel had offered to give her a ride to work – to t ransport her to work. Now, normally if someone offers to give you a ride, the person has a car, but Pawel doesn’t have a car – he has a motorcycle. A “motorc ycle” is, you probably know, like a car, except it only has two wheels, like a b icycle. Bernadette says, “I’m not sure about this,” meaning she doesn’t know if she r eally wants to ride with Pawel on his motorcycle.

Pawel says, “Come on, put on this helmet and get on .” He’s saying to Bernadette, “Come and get on the bicycle.” Now in t he U.S., in many states you have to wear a helmet if you ride a motorcycle. A “ helmet” (helmet) is basically a thick, heavy hat that you wear over your head to pr otect it. Pawel says, “You’ll get to work much faster,” meaning you will get to w ork faster if you come on my motorcycle than if you, say, take a bus.

“We can zip around cars and go between lanes.” “To zip” (zip) means to move very quickly, especially to drive very quickly. Paw el also says that he can “go between lanes” (lanes). A “lane” is a space between  two lines on the road. You could have a road that has two lanes: one going in one direction, one going in the other direction. Or you could have a freeway that h as six, seven, or eight lanes. Some of the freeways here in Los Angeles are that b ig.

In California (and perhaps a few other states, I’m not sure), it’s legal for motorcycles to actually drive between two cars that  are next to each other. It’s absolutely crazy in my opinion, but nobody asked me  for my opinion. That’s the law. Motorcycles can go in between cars. In some st ates, probably in most states, this is illegal, but not here in California . Bernadette says, “That’s what I’m afraid of.” She’s scared about going in between car s, going between lanes, and zipping around cars.

Pawel says, “I’m an experienced driver,” meaning I’ ve been doing this a long time. “I rode a moped when I was a teenager.” A “mo ped” (moped) is basically a motorized bicycle. It’s sort of like a motorcycle, but it’s smaller and it’s not as fast as a motorcycle. We also learn that Pawel had a sco oter in college. A “scooter” (scooter) is a kind of motorcycle. The scooters usu ally have a, what’s called,

“platform” where the driver’s feet can go. It’s sor t of in between a moped and a motorcycle in terms of how heavy or powerful it is,  how fast it goes.

Pawel says, “I got my first bike when I was 22.” He re the word “bike” refers not to a bicycle that you use your legs to power, but rath er to mopeds, scooters, and motorcycles. Pawel says, “I ride with my motorcycle  club every weekend, so you don’t have to worry about safety.” A “motorcycle” i s the most powerful kind of two-wheeled vehicle, at least, that’s commonly used . We’ve talked about a moped and a scooter. The motorcycle would be sort of like the largest of those three bikes.

A “club” is an organization, a group of people who are typically interested in the same thing. Some people are members of motorcycle c lubs. Pawel says, “You don’t have to worry about safety” (about me hurting  you or hurting myself) because he practices, if you will, a lot with his m otorcycle club. Bernadette is not completely convinced.

She says, “I’m sure you’re a good driver, but one w rong move and I’m roadkill.” “Road (road)kill” refers to an animal that has been  hit by a car or a truck, usually on a freeway or street where cars and trucks are mo ving very fast. Roadkill happens, unfortunately. Sometimes animals come out into the lanes of traffic, onto the road, and sometimes they get hit and kille d. Bernadette is saying that if Pawel’s motorcycle has an accident, she would be ju st like roadkill – she would die and her body would be there on the road.

Pawel says, “Get on and I promise to behave.” “Get on” means get onto the motorcycle. Pawel says he promises “to behave” (beh ave). “To behave” is to act nicely – not to do anything crazy or dangerous. He says, “I won’t pop any wheelies, spin out, or do any other tricks.” Pawel mentions a couple of dangerous things that you could do on a motorcycle. One of th em is “to pop (pop) a wheelie (wheelie).” “To pop a wheelie” is to perform a tric k where you are only riding on the back tire. The front tire, the front wheel, is up in the air so you’re basically on only one wheel. That’s “to pop a wheelie.”

We used to do that with our bicycles when we were k ids. We would try to pop a wheelie. Of course, you often end up falling off of  your bike and hurting yourself, which is why Pawel is saying he will not do that, b ecause that would be dangerous. He also promises not to “spin (spin) out .” “To spin out” is a phrasal verb that is used to describe what happens if your car or motorcycle suddenly starts to move in an uncontrollable way, often in c ircles.

If you are, for example, driving down a street that  has a lot of ice on it, and then you try to stop your car suddenly, your car could s pin out. You could spin in a circle on top of the ice. This is quite frequent. I  remember growing up in Minnesota, and when I learned to drive, having this  happen to me once or twice, so it can be a common occurrence – but it is a very  dangerous thing because, of course, you could hit someone else, as well as hurt  yourself.

Bernadette says, “If that was intended to put my mi nd at ease, it didn’t work.” Bernadette is saying that Pawel’s promise doesn’t r eally help convince her. It doesn’t put her mind at ease. “To put someone’s min d at ease” (ease) means to calm someone, to make someone feel relaxed and not worried. Bernadette says that Pawel’s promises not to pop a wheelie and spin  out do not put her mind at ease. She’s not relaxed.

Pawel says, “All right, last call.” “Last call” is sort of your last opportunity to do something. If you go to a bar at the end of the nig ht just before the bar is going to close, usually ten or fifteen minutes before the ba r will close, the bartender – the person working serving the drinks at the bar – will  say, “Last call,” meaning this is your last opportunity to get, in that case, a drink . This is Pawel’s last opportunity to convince Bernadette to get on his motorcycle.

He says, “You want a ride to work or not?” He’s say ing to Bernadette, “If you want me to give you a ride to work, then you have t o get on now. Otherwise, I’m going to leave.” Bernadette says, “Okay, I’m puttin g my life in your hands.” “To put your life in someone’s hands” means to do somet hing so that another person is in charge of or in control of your safety and se curity. If you go on an airplane, you put your lives in the hands of the pilots and t he airline company.

Bernadette says, “If I die, it will be on your cons cience.” The expression “to be on someone’s conscience” (conscience) means that you w ill feel guilty in the future if something bad happens. Your “conscience” is your  sense of right and wrong – your beliefs about what is right to do and what is wrong to do. If something is “on your conscience,” it’s bothering you. It’s somethin g that you feel bad about, something you feel guilty about, perhaps.

Pawel says, “No worries,” meaning don’t worry. “If we wipe out, it’ll take us both out, so I won’t be conscious to worry about my cons cience.” Pawel makes an odd little joke here at the end. He tells Bernadette, “ If we wipe out, it’ll take us both out.” “To wipe (wipe) out” means to crash, especial ly if you are riding a bicycle, a motorcycle, or a skateboard. “To wipe out” means to  fall down and often to hurt yourself. Pawel says that if he and Bernadette wipe  out, that action will “take us both out.” “To take someone out” means to kill some one, to end someone’s life.

 Pawel says if they have an accident, both of them w ill die, and in that case, Pawel won’t be “conscious” (conscious) to worry abo ut his conscience. “To be conscious” means to be aware of something, especial ly aware of your surroundings – the things and people around you. If  you’re not conscious, you don’t have to worry about your conscience, since yo u are sort of like asleep. You aren’t aware of your surroundings, and so you’re no t thinking about the guilt you might feel, in this case, for killing your friend o r your workmate.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
