This episode is a dialogue between Yesenia and Juli an.  It’s going to be about traveling to another country and getting special pe rmission, what we call a “visa,” to go there.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Yesenia:  I have a great idea.  Let’s plan a big pa rty for your mother’s 70 th birthday.  We’ll invite all of your relatives from all over the world.

Julian:  I don’t think very many of them can afford  to travel half way around the world for a party.

Yesenia:  I’ve already spoken to your rich brother and he’s already offered to pay for your family’s airfare and hotel.  If we plan it , he’ll pay for it.

Julian:  Julio offered to do that?  Well, if he’s o n board then we can give it a shot. But here’s another hitch.  My extended family lives  in a lot of different countries and I’m not sure they’ll get visas to visit the U.S ., especially on short notice.

Yesenia:  Let’s try, anyway.  Your cousins in Canad a don’t need a visa because most Canadian citizens don’t need one to cross the border.  What about your uncle in Korea?

Julian:  He’s already in the U.S. on an exchange vi sitor visa until June.  He should be able to come.

Yesenia:  What about your aunt in Greece?

Julian:  She won’t need a visa because Greece is on e of the countries in the Visa Waiver Program.

Yesenia:  Do you think your nephews in South Africa  will want to come?

Julian:  I’m not sure what the visa situation is th ere.  We’ll have to check with the State Department.

Yesenia:  I’ll get on the horn first thing in the m orning to see what I can find out.  I might email them and ask them to check with the emb assy or a consulate there to be sure.  This party is really shaping up.

Julian:  You seem to have it all under control.

Yesenia:  Haven’t you always said that party planni ng is my middle name?

Our dialogue begins with Yesenia saying, “I have a great idea.  Let’s plan a big party for your mother’s 70 th  birthday.  We’ll invite all of your relatives from  all over the world.”  Your “relatives” are the people who are related to you either because you are their uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, brother , sister – any sort of relation that is by blood or by marriage.  That is, because they are somehow connected to you biologically – genetically, or because you m arried someone that is related to them.  So Yesenia wants to invite all of Julian’ s relatives.  Julian says, “I don’t think very many of them can afford to travel (have the money to travel) half way around the world for a party.”  We say “half way ar ound the world,” we often use that to indicate on another continent, in another p art of the world.

Yesenia says, “I’ve already spoken with your rich b rother and he’s already offered to pay for your family’s airfare and hotel.   If we plan it, he’ll pay for it.” Must be a very rich brother!  Julian says, “Julio o ffered to do that?  Well, if he’s on board then we can give it a shot.”  “To be on bo ard” means to be in agreement with something, to support some project o r to be involved in it.  Julian says, “we can give it a shot.”  “To give (something ) a shot” (shot) means to try something even when you are not sure if you are going to succeed – if you are going to be successful.  He says, “But here’s anoth er hitch” (hitch).  A “hitch” is a minor problem, something that makes it more difficu lt for you to do what you want to do.  He says, “My extended family lives in a lot  of different countries.”  Your “extended family” are the relatives that are not yo ur brother, your sister, your son or daughter, or your parents.  Everyone else is you r extended family: uncles, aunts, cousins, great-grandfathers, and so forth.  We call the people who are

closest to you – parents, brothers, sisters, and ch ildren – your “immediate family.”

Julian says that his extended family lives in a lot  of different countries, “and I’m not sure they’ll get visas to visit the U.S., espec ially on short notice.”  A “visa” (visa) is official permission that a country gives you to visit and stay for a certain amount of time in that country.  So if you are comi ng to the United States, from many countries you need a tourist visa or a student  visa or a work visa to come here, depending on what you are going to do.  The e xpression “on short notice” means without a lot of time to do something, withou t very much advance warning or advance notice.  Julian is saying there isn’t a lot of time to get, perhaps, some of these visas, and since it can sometimes take a l ong time to get a visa to come to the United States this may be a problem.

Yesenia says, “Let’s try, anyway.  Your cousins in Canada don’t need a visa because most Canadian citizens don’t need one to cr oss the border.”  “To be a citizen” means to be someone who is officially part  of a certain country.  You have certain rights, like voting; you may have cert ain responsibilities, like paying taxes.  That’s to be a citizen.  I’m a citizen of t he United States.  Some people are “dual citizens,” that is, they are citizens of more than one country.  The “border” (border) is the line – the imaginary line that separates two countries or two different parts of property.  It could be two s tates, it could be two cities; here, it refers to two countries: the United States and t he Country of Canada.  Yesenia says most Canadian citizens don’t need a visa to cr oss the border to come to the United States, to go from one side to the other.  “ What about your uncle in Korea?”  Julian says, “He’s already in the U.S. on an exchange visitor visa until June.”  An “exchange visitor visa” is permission to  enter the United States in some sort of exchange program, where some people fr om your country come here, some people from our country go to your count ry.  Usually it’s to study or to work for a certain amount of time.

By the way, I am not an expert on visas and coming to the United States, so unfortunately if you email me questions I probably won’t be able to answer them. If you have real questions about visas, you should talk to the U.S. Embassy or a representative of the U.S. government in your count ry.  Or even easier, go on the Internet and go to the website for that.

Anyway, back to our story.  Julian has an uncle in Korea, who’s on an exchange visitor visa.  Notice we say “on a visa,” not just “has a visa,” although you could say that.  Yesenia says, “What about your aunt in G reece?”  Julian says, “She won’t need a visa because Greece is one of the coun tries in the Visa Waiver Program.”  The “Visa Waiver Program” is a special p rogram the U.S. has that

allows citizens of 36 countries to enter the United  States for up to 90 days.  That is, from 1 to 90 days without having to get a visa.   There are many countries in this program.  The Czech Republic, Malta, and Brune i are three countries in the Visa Waiver Program, and no, I don’t know what the other ones are.

Yesenia says, “Do you think your nephews in South A frica will want to come?” Your “nephews” are, of course, the sons of your bro ther or sister.  Julian says, “I’m not sure what the visa situation is there.  We ’ll have to check with the State Department.”  “The State Department” is the oldest U.S. government department, I believe.  It deals with international relations, with passports, with visas.  As I record this, Hilary Clinton is the head of the Stat e Department.  The head of the departments we call “secretaries.”  She is the Secr etary of State.  The State Department is the organization that operates all of  the U.S. Embassies and Consulates throughout the world.  If you go to be t heir website, you will find information about visas, and they have their websit e in many different languages as well.

Julian says, “We have to check with the State Depar tment.”  Yesenia says, “I’ll get on the horn first thing in the morning to see w hat I can find out.”  “To get on the horn” means to call someone on a telephone.  It ’s a kind of an old expression, but you’ll still here it: “Get on the h orn and ask my brother when he’s coming over for dinner.”  Yesenia says, “I might em ail them and ask them to check with the embassy or consulate there to be sur e.”  An “embassy” is the official building where one country is represented in another country, usually in the capital city of that country.  So the embassies  from all the different countries of the world that have embassies in the United Stat es are in Washington, D.C. The “consulate” is the office or building where a f oreign government has representatives, but it’s not in the main city of t he country.  It’s something other than the embassy.  So for example, here in Los Ange les we have a consulate for many different governments.  The Mexican government , several Latin American and Asian governments have consulates here in the U nited States in different cities, and specifically here in Los Angeles.  If y ou want to get a visa to come to the United States, you often have to go to an embas sy or a consulate in your country.

Yesenia says, “This party is really shaping up.”  “ To shape up” is a two-word phrasal verb that here means to begin to progress, to advance, to begin to start to take form.  The word “shape” has several meaning s in English, however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ex planations.  Julian says to Yesenia, “You seem to have it all under control,” m eaning you seem to have everything worked out, you know what you’re doing.  Yesenia says, “Haven’t you always said (haven’t you always told me) that party  planning is my middle

name?”  “Party planning” is just what it sounds lik e; making plans, making arrangements for a celebration – a party.  We have this expression, “(something) is my middle name,” or “(something) is your middle name.”  It means that you are very good at what you do and you like to do it.  So  we might say, “Podcasting is my middle name,” meaning I am so interested and so enjoy doing podcasting that it is as if it were part of my own name, part of my own identity.  Whatever you love to do – skiing, or going on Facebook, or walki ng, or reading – you could say any of those activities are your middle name if you  are good at them, and/or if you really enjoy doing them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
