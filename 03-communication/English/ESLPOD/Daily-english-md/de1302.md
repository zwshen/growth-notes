This episode is a dialogue between Winnie and Finn,  who are both complaining about their parents. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Winnie: I can’t believe it. My dad is so clueless.

Finn: What did he do now?

Winnie: He gave me permission to go to Gabi’s party , but I have to be home by 11 p.m. because of my curfew.

Finn: At least he’s letting you go. My mom is so ov erprotective that she won’t let me go to any parties.

Winnie: Unbelievable! Do your parents get on your c ase all the time like mine do?

Finn: Yeah! My mom is always nagging me to do my ho mework and then complains that I spend too much time by myself in m y room rather than with the family.

Winnie: At least your parents don’t tell you what y ou can wear. My mom still wants to pick out my clothes! What am I, five?

Finn: My parents are worse. They’re always comparin g me to my smarter brothers. I’m a huge disappointment to them. I’m al ways coming up short.

Winnie: My parents are never satisfied either. They ’re always saying that my grades aren’t good enough and my attitude needs imp roving.

Finn: At least your parents don’t embarrass you by fighting all the time, even in public.

 Winnie: We have such hard lives. Nobody understands  us.

Finn: I know. Nobody in history has ever suffered a s much as we have!

We begin our dialogue with Winnie saying, “I can’t believe it.” “I can’t believe it” is something we say when we are surprised or when some thing seems strange to us. Winnie says, “My dad” – my father – “is so clue less.” “To be clueless” (clueless) means not to understand the world around  you, not to be aware of what is happening. Someone who is either not very i ntelligent, not very smart, or who isn’t paying attention could be described as cl ueless, especially when he does something that would indicate he doesn’t under stand what is happening around him.

Finn asks Winnie, “What did he do now?” – what did her father do. Winnie responds, “He gave me permission to go to Gabi’s pa rty, but I have to be home by 11 p.m. because of my curfew.” “Permission” (per mission) is approval to do something or to have something. “Approval” means so meone says, “Yes, you can do that.” Parents may give permission to their children to do certain things. Children, of course, are supposed to “obey” (obey) their parents – that is, do what their parents say. Not all children do that, I  am told.

Winnie has been given permission by her father to g o to Gabi’s party, but she has to return home by 11:00 at night because she ha s a “curfew” (curfew). “Curfew” is a time, usually in the evening, before which you have to be home. Parents often give their children, especially their  teenage children, a curfew – a time at which they must return home so that they do n’t get into trouble. Sometimes a government will have a curfew for its c itizens, telling people they must be at home before a certain time.

Winnie has a curfew of 11 p.m., meaning she must be  back at her house by 11:00 at night. We’re not sure how old Winnie and F inn are, but we’re guessing they are teenagers – somewhere between the ages of,  say, 13 and 17. Finn says, “At least he’s letting you go,” meaning at le ast Winnie’s father is letting her go to this party. “To let someone go” is a phrasal verb meaning to give the person permission or approval.

Finn says, “My mom is so overprotective that she wo n’t let me go to any parties.” “To be protective” of someone means to try to take care of someone, to make sure that a person isn’t hurt in any way. “To be ov erprotective” (overprotective)

means to go too far, to be too protective of someon e, so much so that you are preventing that person perhaps from doing what he wants to do. The prefix “over” always means too much of something. So, “to overfil l” your glass with water is to put too much water in your glass. “To overprotect” means to protect too much.

Winnie then says, “Unbelievable.” Something that is  “unbelievable” could be something that is impossible to believe. However, W innie is using this word to show how surprised she is by something, especially in a way that indicates that she disapproves or thinks it’s wrong. Winnie says, “Do your parents get on your case all the time like mine do?” “To get on someone ’s case” (case) means to bother someone by telling him all the things he’s d oing wrong. Another term for this is the verb “to nag” (nag), which comes up in the very next sentence.

Winnie that her parents “get on her case all the ti me,” meaning constantly. They’re always criticizing her or telling her what she is doing wrong. Finn says the same thing happens to him. Poor Finn. Finn says , “Yeah! My mom is always nagging me to do my homework.” “To nag” is similar to “to get on your case,” however, “to nag” usually has the meaning of to be reminding someone all the time about something he is supposed to do.

A wife may “nag” her husband to do the dishes. If t he husband doesn’t do them when she asks him to do them, she may say, “Could y ou please do the dishes now,” and then 10 minutes later, “When are you goin g to do the dishes?” and then 20 minutes later, “How come you haven’t done t he dishes yet?” That would be “to nag.” Of course, a husband can nag a wife as  well, though he won’t remain her husband very long if he does.

In any case, Finn is complaining about his mother n agging him to do his “homework” – that is, the work that he is supposed to do from the classes he takes at school. Finn says his mother nags him to d o his homework and then complains that he spends too much time by himself i n his room.

Finn says his mother “complains.” “To complain” (co mplain) means to show that you are unhappy about something, to say what you do n’t like about a certain person or a certain thing or a situation. Finn’s mo ther complains that Finn spends too much time by himself in his room rather than be ing with his family, although she also tells him he is supposed to do his homewor k. So, he’s a little confused and I understand that.

Winnie says, “At least your parents don’t tell you what you can wear. My mom still wants to pick out my clothes!” Winnie complai ns that her mother “wants to pick out,” or select, or choose her clothing. “To p ick out” is a two-word phrasal

verb meaning to select. She then tries to be funny by saying, “What am I, five?” meaning “Does she think I’m five years old and I ne ed for her to pick out my clothing?”

Finn says, “My parents are worse. They’re always co mparing me to my smarter brothers.” “To compare” means to show how two diffe rent things are similar, although we would sometimes use this also to mean t o show how they are different. Some people use a different verb, “to co ntrast” (contrast), to mean to show how two things are different. “To compare” wou ld mean to show how they are similar, but in conversational English, we ofte n use “to compare” to mean either to show how things are the same or how they are different.

Finn’s parents compare him to his more intelligent or “smarter” brothers. “I’m a huge disappointment to them,” he says. “To be a dis appointment” means to not do as well as someone hopes that you will do, or to  not be as smart, in this case, as your parents hoped that you would be. Many of us  are disappointments to our parents, I’m sure, just as our parents were probabl y disappointments to their parents.

Finn says, “I’m always coming up short.” The expres sion “to come up short” means to disappoint, not to be as good as someone e xpects you to be. It can also mean to get fewer points than you need to win a game. If we say that the Los Angeles Dodgers tried very hard to win their ga me but “came up short,” we mean they didn’t have a high enough score to win the game.

Winnie says, “My parents are never satisfied either .” “To be satisfied” (satisfied) means to be happy. It’s the opposite of “disappoint ed.” It means that you are happy because someone met your expectations. You are pleased, or we might say you are “content” (content). Winnie says that h er parents are always saying that her “grades,” her marks at school, “aren’t goo d enough” and that her “attitude needs improving.” “Attitude” (attitude) m eans how you view the world or how you react to things. Teenagers often have a poo r attitude in the minds of their parents.

Finn says, “At least your parents don’t embarrass y ou by fighting all the time, even in public.” Notice that several times in this dialogue, our characters say “at least.” This is often used as a way of introducing a statement that will be even worse than the situation that you just described. F or example, someone may say, “I’m really tired and I have to work all day.” Some one else will say, “Well, at least you get to go home to a nice house when you’re done  working. I have to work all day and I have to go visit my mother-in-law when I’ m done working.” He’s saying that his situation is even worse than your bad situ ation.

 Finn says that his situation is worse than Winnie’s  because his parents “embarrass” him. “To embarrass” (embarrass) means t o make another person feel strange or ashamed or self-conscious. People o ften talk about “being embarrassed,” meaning that they feel strange becaus e they’re in a situation where perhaps they are shown to be unusual or uncom fortable. Finn’s parents embarrass him by fighting, by disagreeing, “even in  public,” meaning when other people they don’t know are around or are present in  the same room.

Winnie says, “We have such hard lives,” meaning we have very difficult lives. “Nobody understands us.” Finn says, “I know. Nobody  in history,” meaning no one ever before this time, “has ever suffered as mu ch as we have.” “To suffer” (suffer) means to experience some pain, either phys ical or in this case emotional. Winnie and Finn, like many teenagers, believe that their lives are the most difficult lives anyone has ever had to live.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
