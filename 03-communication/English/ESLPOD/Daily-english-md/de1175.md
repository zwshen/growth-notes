[start of dialogue]

Nico: I’ve moving to Atlanta. I want a fresh start.

Celia: This is a surprise. I thought you were going  to stick it out here and try to put the past behind you.

Nico: There are too many reminders here. I want a c lean slate. What’s done is done and I’m tired of blame and recriminations.

Celia: I’m glad to hear you’ve stopped beating your self up over what’s happened, but are you sure moving away will help you move on?

Nico: The world is my oyster now, isn’t it? I can l ive anywhere I want to and do anything I want to.

Celia: I guess so, but are you sure you want to upr oot and leave town?

Nico: I’m not trying to reinvent myself, but if I’m  going to start over, I might as well do it in a new town.

Celia: I guess a new town is a good place to start a new life, and maybe you’ll find a new love. Many people bounce back from a dif ficult divorce.

Nico: I’ve sworn off women. The only female I want in my life right now is my dog, Fifi!

We’re getting a fresh start on this episode – a new  opportunity to do things differently. Nico in the dialogue says he’s moving to Atlanta. Atlanta is a city in the state of Georgia, in the southeast part of the U.S. Nico says he wants “a fresh start.” Celia is surprised. In fact, she says, “Thi s is a surprise. I thought you were going to stick it out here and try to put the past behind you.”

“To stick it out” means to continue to do something  even though it is difficult, even though it may be challenging. “To put the past  behind you” means to no longer worry about what happened before. It can als o mean, sometimes, to no longer do the bad things that you used to do. “To p ut the past behind you” means to focus on the future or on what you’re doing righ t now and no longer worry about what you did before. Celia thought that Nico was going to put the past behind him and stay here, wherever “here” is in our  dialogue.

But Nico says, “There are too many reminders here.”  A “reminder” (reminder) is something that makes you remember something. It cou ld be something you have to do now, or could be something that you did once many years ago or anytime in your past. That second meaning is what Nico is u sing here when he says, “There are too many reminders here.” He means there  are too many things that make him remember bad things that happened to him.

He says, “I want a clean slate” (slate). A “slate” is a kind of writing surface, something you write on. A “clean slate” would be a new starting point. It’s basically the same as a “fresh start.” “To have a c lean slate” means that you don’t worry about anything in the past. A clean sla te means you don’t worry about or don’t consider anything that has already b een done. Nico says, “What’s done is done and I’m tired of blame and recriminati ons.”

The expression “what’s done is done” is a somewhat unusual one, but basically it says, “I’m not going to worry about what has happen ed in the past because I can’t change it.” Although Shakespeare wasn’t the f irst person to use this expression, people often associate it with him beca use he uses it in his play, Macbeth . Lady Macbeth says, “What’s done is done,” and lat er she adds, “What’s done cannot be undone.” “To undo” something  would be to reverse something that has happened. And of course, you can ’t go back and change the past – what’s done is done.

Nico says he’s tired of “blame” (blame) and “recrim inations” (recriminations). “Blame” is the responsibility for doing something w rong. We usually use the expression “take the blame.” “I will take the blame ” means I will take responsibility; I will take the consequences of wha t has gone wrong here. “Recriminations” refer to what we call “accusations .” “To accuse” (accuse) someone is to say that someone did something wrong.  “Accusation” is the noun form, from the verb “to accuse.”

“Recriminations” are accusations that Person A make s against Person B after Person B has already made an accusation against Per son A. So for example, you say that I did something wrong, and I say, “Wel l, you did something wrong.” You see, I am accusing you of something after you h ave already accused me of doing something wrong.

Celia says, “I’m glad to hear you’ve stopped beatin g yourself up over what’s happened.” “To beat yourself up” over something mea ns to criticize yourself too much – to be, we might say, “overly critical.” To b e unable to forgive yourself is to beat yourself up over something. Celia says, “Are y ou sure moving away will help you move on?” “To move on” means to no longer think  about something that has happened, something bad that has happened, and to p lan for the future.

Nico says, “The world is my oyster now, isn’t it?” The expression, “The world is my oyster” (oyster) means that you can do whatever you want. You have freedom, perhaps money, or other things that will a llow you to do whatever you want. Nico says, “I can live anywhere I want to and  do anything I want to.”

Celia says, “I guess so, but are you sure you want to uproot and leave town?” “To uproot” means to move yourself from one place t o a completely different place. We sometimes use that verb when you are not only moving, but you are breaking off your relationships from the place wher e you live now and going to a completely new place where you don’t know anyone.

Nico says, “I’m not trying to reinvent myself, but if I’m going to start over, I might as well do it in a new town.” “To reinvent yourself ” would mean to change yourself significantly – to change your personality , perhaps, or to start acting in a way that is completely different from the way you a cted in the past. “To start over” means to begin again. It’s similar to having a fresh start. Nico says, “I might as well do it in a new town.” The phrase “might (mi ght) as well” is used to show that two different ideas are equal and there’s no r eally good reason to select one over the other. It doesn’t really matter.

For example, it’s four o’clock in the afternoon and  you’re working on a project, but in order to work more on the project, you need to talk to your boss. Your boss isn’t in the office, so you say, “Well, I might as well go home because I can’t do anything on this project until I talk to my boss.” Of course, if you’re supposed to stay at your work until five o’clock, your boss mig ht not be very happy that you left, but in your mind there wasn’t any advantage f or you to stay at your office because you couldn’t continue working on the projec t. So you chose another option, which was to go home.

Nico says he might as well start over in a new town . It won’t matter. Celia says, “I guess a new town is a good place to start a new lif e, and maybe you’ll find a new love. Many people bounce back from a difficult divo rce.” “To bounce (bounce) back” from something means to recover from somethin g, to get your happiness back, or to perhaps get your physical health back. We could talk about someone “bouncing back” from an illness – getting healthy a gain, getting stronger again.

Nico says, “I’ve sworn off women.” “To swear (swear ) off” means to promise not to do something again. “I am swearing off drinking beer.” I’m never going to drink beer again. I’m promising never to drink beer again . That’s “to swear off” something. In this case, Nico is swearing off women . He’s not going to get involved romantically with another woman.

Nico says, “The only female I want in my life right  now is my dog, Fifi.” A “female” (female) is the opposite of a “male” (male). “Male”  and “female” are sexes. The human race has a “male” and a “female.” Many animal s – most animals, I would think – have male and female members. If you don’t know the difference between males and females, I’m not really the person to tel l you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
