This episode is called “Introducing a New Product.”  It’s a dialogue between Augie and Lillian.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Augie:  Today’s the day.  I’m giving you the heads up.  O ur company is rolling out its new line of cell phones. 

Lillian:  I can see you’re excited about it.  What’s so spe cial about the new products? 

Augie:  This line of phones has state-of-the-art techno logy and never-before- seen features.  It’s been in development for over a year and it’s been really hard keeping it under wraps.   

Lillian:  I thought information was leaked weeks ago.  

Augie:  Those were just rumors, and the company put a cl amp on those pretty quickly. 

Lillian:  Wasn’t the new line supposed to come out next month?   

Augie:  That was the original plan, but since McQ Corp.  is coming out with its own line of phones soon, we wanted to get a jump on t hem. 

Lillian:  And steal their thunder. 

 Augie:  Yes, and steal their thunder.  We had to scramb le to get the phones ready ahead of schedule, but I think it was worth it.  T hey’re really going to make a splash. 

Lillian:  I hope so.  I hope all of this hype has been justified. 

Augie:  Oh, it will be.  I’ll know soon enough. 

Lillian:  How? 

Augie:  You’ll be begging me to get you one. 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Augie saying, “Today’s the day.  I’m giving you the heads up.  Our company is rolling out its new line of ce ll phones.”  To give (someone) the heads up” means to let someone know someth ing is going to happen in the future, to give someone information bef ore other people may have it; you’re letting them know early about something.  “M y friend in the accounting department gave me a heads up about how the company wa s doing this year.” He gave me some information before other people got i t.  In this case, Augie is giving Lillian the heads up about the fact that their company is rolling out its new line of cell phones.  “To roll (roll) out” is a two-wo rd phrasal verb meaning when a company introduces and begins selling a new product or ser vice.  We use this verb, “to roll out,” meaning to launch, to begin a n ew product, start selling something different.  “Line” here, as in “new line of  cell phones,” just means a new group or a new set of cell phones.  “Roll” has severa l meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Lillian says, “I can see you’re excited about it.  What’s so special about the new products?”  Augie says, “This line of phones has state-of- the-art technology and never-before-seen features.”  “State-of-the-art,” with  hyphens in between each word, means very modern, very advanced, the newest and the  best technology – state-of-the-art technology.  We use state-of-the-art t ypically to talk about machines or computers, something mechanical.  “Never-befor e-seen,” also with hyphens in between the words – never-before-seen – mean s that no one has ever seen or experienced something like this; it’s complet ely new, it never existed before in the past.   

Augie thinks their cell phones have never-before-seen feat ures.  He says, “It’s been in development for over a year (for more than a year) and it’s been really  

 hard keeping it under wraps.”  When something is “in de velopment” we mean that it is being worked on by a company but it isn’t fini shed yet.  We use this expression a lot here in Los Angeles in talking about movi es and films, and when I say “we,” I mean people who work in films and movies – not me.  When they say “in development,” they’re referring to something tha t is not yet produced, often not even yet filmed, but something that they are working on.  In fact, there’s even an expression “a development deal” (deal), or a de velopment agreement. When one of the big media companies decides to do someth ing about a particular series or idea, they make an agreement with a  person and they develop the idea – they work on it. 

Augie says that it’s been really hard to keep this new cell  phone under wraps. “To keep (something) under wraps” (wraps) means to keep something secret, not to share information about it to other people.  Lill ian says, “I thought information was leaked weeks ago.”  The verb “to leak” (leak) in this ca se means to share secret information with the newspaper or with the gene ral public or on the Internet about your company or about your organization.   Typically, it’s secret information that you are not supposed to tell anyone e lse.  There are leaks all the time of information from the government.  Somebody te lls the media – tells the newspapers about some secret, that’s called a leak. 

Augie says, “Those were just rumors.”  A “rumor” is somethi ng that is unofficial, and may or may not be true but many people are talking about it.  There are rumors that Brad Pitt is considering making a movie abou t my life.  Actually, I’m starting that rumor.  If you could tell other people,  then we would have a rumor; people would be talking about it.  It’s not necessarily t rue, however.  I’ll let you guess whether it is true or not!  Augie says, “the company put a clamp on those pretty quickly.”  “To put a clamp (clamp) on (something)”  means to stop something from happening or to stop it from continuin g to happen, typically by doing something drastic – that is, with a lot of force, power, or strength.  Well, the company put a clamp on those rumors pretty, or very, quickly. 

Lillian says, “Wasn’t the new line supposed to come out n ext month?”  The phrasal verb “to come out,” in this case only, means to be  released, to be introduced to something, to be made available to the p ublic.  So a company that has a new thing it is selling will say the new phone, fo r example, is coming out in July, meaning that’s when you can buy it – in July.   

Augie says, “That was the original plan, but since McQ Cor p. is coming out with its own line of phones soon, we wanted to get a jump on them.”  “To get a jump on (someone)” means to do something before someone else does it before you,  

 to do something faster or sooner than another person, o ften when you are competing with that other person.  You may decide to ge t a jump on your schooling by taking classes in the summer, when everyone else will start in the fall.  You’re doing it before everyone else.  Lillian  says, “And steal their thunder.” So, Augie is saying that their company is releasing their  phone now, before the McQ Corp. releases their new phone.  The reason, Lilli an says, is to steal their thunder.  “Thunder” is normally the sound that is made when there is a big storm and there is what is called lightning, which are very po werful electrical charges that appear sometimes in a big storm.  In this case, ho wever, “to steal (someone’s) thunder” means to take attention away from s omeone else, or to get the praise of other people before the other person can .  It’s normally something you don’t want to do, unless you don’t want to be nice to someone.  In this case, the company wants to make sure that its new product gets pu blicity before McQ Corp.’s new phone. 

Augie says, “Yes, and steal their thunder.  We had to scr amble to get the phones ready ahead of schedule, but I think it was worth it.”  “To scramble” here means to do something very quickly, to do it faster than you wou ld normally do it. “Scramble,” however, has a couple of different meanings in English, and those are in the Learning Guide.  They were scrambling to ge t the phones ready “ahead of schedule,” meaning before the deadline, bef ore the day that it was supposed to be done.  If your schedule says you’re finishing  the product or the project next Tuesday, and you decide you want to finish it  on this Friday, you are finishing it ahead of schedule, before the original p lan.   

Augie says the new phones are really going to make a splash  (splash).  “To make a splash” means to do something that attracts a lot of attention, that many people look at or notice.  Lillian says, “I hope so.  I h ope all of this hype has been justified.”  “Hype” (hype) is things that are said about a product that make people more interested in wanting to buy it, often before it  is even available.  You could talk about the hype over a new movie: people are talking  about it; people are saying how good it is.  Hype is always a positive thing – at  least positive things being said about this new thing that is not yet availabl e.  However, it’s also sometimes used to mean that people are exaggerating – a re saying things that are better about it than it really is. 

Lillian says she hopes the hype has been justified, meaning  something that you can support, something for which there’s evidence, somethin g that shows that it really is what it says it is.  Augie says, “Oh, it will be.   I’ll know soon enough,” meaning very quickly, soon.  Lillian says, “How?”  Augie says,  “You’ll be begging  

 me to get one.”  “To beg” (beg) means to plead, to ask someone to do something in a very urgent way.  “Please help me.”  You’re beggin g for help. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
