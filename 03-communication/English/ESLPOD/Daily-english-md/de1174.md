This episode is a dialogue between Amelia and Victo r about how we describe the quality of video, such as what you watch on televis ion or perhaps on your computer. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Amelia: I wish we had hired a professional videogra pher to film it instead of asking your friend Lenny to do it.

Victor: This video isn’t so bad. The production qua lity isn’t the best, but he did a pretty good job.

Amelia: It’s not bad if you like your video out of focus. There are no transitions between scenes and the lighting is terrible. At bes t, it looks like a rough cut.

Victor: It is a little rough, I admit.

Amelia: There are problems with the audio, too. The re are sections of dead air when the audio cuts out. And when there is audio, the volume isn’t uniform.

Victor: That’s true, too, I guess . . .

Amelia: And the handheld camera footage is so shaky  that I feel ill watching it.

Victor: Lenny was just having a good time, getting into the spirit of it.

Amelia: Is that why he got close-up shots of all of  the pretty women and none of the other guests?

Victor: Well, you know Lenny. He’ll do better next time.

 Amelia: Next time?! How many times do you plan to g et married?

Amelia begins our dialogue by saying, “I wish we ha d hired a professional videographer to film it instead of asking your frie nd Lenny to do it.” Amelia mentions a “professional videographer” (videographe r). A videographer is a person whose job it is to make movies of certain sp ecial events – to film special events such as birthdays, but more typically someth ing such as a wedding, which is what we’re talking about in this dialogue.

Amelia and Victor asked Victor’s friend Lenny to fi lm their wedding instead of getting someone who was a professional – someone wh o knew what he was doing, basically. Notice, “videographer” is like the word “photographer.” A photographer is someone who takes photos, what we w ould now call “stills” or “still photos.” A videographer is someone who makes  or films video.

Victor says, “This video isn’t so bad,” meaning it’ s not as bad as Amelia says it is. “The production quality isn’t the best, but he did a pretty good job.” “Production quality” refers to how professional a video looks, whether it looks like it was done by someone who knew what he was doing. Victor think s his friend Lenny did a pretty good job, which means not the best job, but not a terrible job either.

Amelia doesn’t agree. She says, “It’s not bad if yo u like your video out of focus.” “Out of focus” means the same as “blurry” (blurry).  Something that is “blurry” or “out of focus” is something that you can’t see clea rly because the lens was not adjusted properly – the part of the camera that is responsible for making sure that the image is clear. The video is “out of focus .”

Amelia adds, “There are no transitions between scen es and the lighting is terrible.” A “scene” (scene) in a video is one part  or section of a video that is about the same topic or that is showing the same ar ea or people. A “transition” (transition) in a video is how you move or change f rom one scene to another. Sometimes in videos, the video will seem to move fr om right to left or top to bottom, or sometimes it will seem as though one sce ne magically fades away or goes away slowly and another one comes in slowly. T hese are called “transitions.”

Amelia says that their video doesn’t have any trans itions. In addition, the “lighting” (lighting) is terrible, meaning that you  can’t see properly. You can’t see things because there isn’t enough light or perhaps there’s too much light. “At

best,” Amelia says,” it looks like a rough cut. The  term “rough cut” (cut) refers to the first draft or the first attempt at editing a v ideo.

If someone makes a video of, say, a wedding, he may  sit down at his computer and put different parts of the wedding footage, or the things that he filmed, together, but it isn’t perfect yet. It’s only his f irst attempt to try to put the different parts of the wedding video together so that it look s good. That first attempt would be a “rough cut.” The opposite of a “rough cut” wou ld be a “final cut.” This is when you’re all done – when you finish doing all the editing on the video.

Victor says, “It is a little rough, I admit.” “Roug h” (rough) here means not perfect, still something that you’re working on. Amelia says , “There are problems with the audio, too.” The “audio” also has problems. The aud io is the sound, of course, of the video. “There are sections of dead air when the  audio cuts out.” “Dead air” (air) is when there is no sound, either on a radio or on a television program or in a video. This is when there is no sound, usually by  accident. There should be sound but there isn’t any.

To say the audio “cuts out” means that it stops sud denly. You are listening to some audio and then suddenly . . . and then you don ’t know what happened. That’s what we mean by the audio “cutting out.” “To  cut out” can also be used in other circumstances meaning simply to stop somethin g. “I’m going to cut out pizza and hot dogs from my diet.” I’m going to stop  eating them completely.

Amelia says, “And when there is audio, the volume i sn’t uniform.” The “volume” (volume) is how loud something is. “To be uniform” (uniform) here means to be constant or the same. If the volume isn’t uniform, sometimes it’s really loud and sometimes it’s what we would call really “soft.” Yo u can barely hear it. Victor says, “That’s true, too, I guess.”

Amelia isn’t finished with her problems, her compla ints. “And the handheld camera footage is so shaky that I feel ill watching  it.” “Handheld” (handheld) means, of course, that you are holding something in  your hand, such as a camera. “Footage” (footage) refers to part of a rec ording, part of the video. So, “handheld camera footage” would be part of the vide o that the person who was the videographer filmed not by using a special inst rument called a “tripod” to keep the camera still and steady, but rather by usi ng his hand and walking around with the video camera in his hand.

When you use a handheld camera, sometimes the foota ge is “shaky” (shaky). “Shaky” means that it’s not steady. It looks like the camera is moving back and forth all the time, and so it’s hard to watch the v ideo because everything keeps

moving up and down and from side to side. Lenny, ac cording to Victor, “was just having a good time, getting into the spirit of it.”  “To get into the spirit” (spirit) of something means to get involved or interested in so mething in such a way that you are excited about it.

Amelia says, “Is that why he got close-up shots of all the pretty women and none of the other guests?” A “close-up shot” (shot) is w hen you bring the camera very close to someone’s, usually, face so that you can s ee them very, what we would say, “close-up” – very near. The term “close-up” us ed as a noun refers to when the camera is right next to a person’s face. You ca n see the face very clearly. Apparently Lenny has a close-up of all the pretty w omen at the wedding and nobody else.

Victor says, “Well, you know Lenny. He’ll do better  next time.” Amelia says, “Next time?! How many times do you plan to get married?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
