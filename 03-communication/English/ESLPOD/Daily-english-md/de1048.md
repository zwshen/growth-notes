This episode is a dialogue between Zoe and Midas ab out initial public offerings. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Zoe: What are you looking at?

Midas: It’s the prospectus for Boogle’s IPO. I wish  I could get in on the initial public offering, but since I can’t, I’ll buy stock as soon as the company becomes publicly traded.

Zoe: I’m not really familiar with how the stock mar ket works. You mean you’re going to buy shares in Boogle?

Midas: That’s right. An IPO is a way for a privatel y owned company to become a publicly owned one. The owners of the company do it  to raise capital, or sometimes it’s for early investors to cash in.

Zoe: Why can’t you buy stock in the initial public offering?

Midas: A company like Boogle works with an underwri ter, like a major investment bank, to help set the share price and to find buyer s for the initial offering.

Zoe: Okay, I’m following you so far.

Midas: Well, that first sale of stock is usually do ne in bulk, and I don’t have a few million dollars lying around to buy that much stock . Luckily for me, those first buyers then turn around and sell that stock in smal ler amounts.

Zoe: And that’s when you’ll buy.

Midas: That’s right. You should get in on it, too.

Zoe: You mean buy some Boogle stock?

Midas: Sure, why not?

Zoe: And risk losing my shirt? No, thanks!

Zoe asks Midas, “What are you looking at?” What are  you reading? Midas says, “It’s the prospectus for Boogle’s IPO.” A “prospect us” (prospectus) is a printed document, usually, that provides information about some investment opportunity.

One of the laws here in the United States requires that companies who want to sell stock or sell partial ownership in their compa nies have to print out or give people written information about the company and the possible risks involved – the possible ways that you might lose your money. T his document, which is probably now communicated to people more by PDF tha n by mail, is called a “prospectus.”

Midas is looking at a prospectus for a company’s IP O. IPO stands for “Initial Public Offering.” “Initial” (initial) here means the first time it’s done. A “public offering” is when a company decides it’s going to s ell “stock” – partial ownership in the company – allowing the average person, or at  least some people, to buy partial ownership in the company. This is abbreviat ed “IPO,” and it stands for Initial Public Offering.

Midas says, “I wish I could get in on the initial p ublic offering, but since I can’t, I’ll buy stock as soon as the company becomes publicly t raded.” “To get in on” something means to participate in something that us ually only a small group of people are allowed to participate in. Sometimes whe n a company has an IPO and they start to sell stock, it will only be avail able to a certain group of people. However, eventually the company becomes “publicly t raded,” allowing anyone to buy stock in it.

“Publicly traded” means that the shares in the comp any, stock in the company, is sold to the public, usually through what’s called a  “stock exchange,” such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchan ge. Yeah, they have a stock exchange in Toronto. Of course they do. Many countries have stock exchanges. There are a couple here in the U.S. and several in Europe and in other countries as well.

Well, we’re talking about a publicly traded company  here. Zoe says, “I’m not really familiar with how the stock market works.” T he “stock market” refers generally to the financial market in which people b uy and sell shares in companies. The “stock market” often refers to a par ticular exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. However, it can also be us ed to refer to the activity of all the different exchanges in the country or even around the world.

People sometimes say, “I’m going to put money in the stock market” – I’m going to buy stocks. I’m going to buy partial shares in c ompanies. Zoe doesn’t understand how the stock market works. She says, “Y ou mean you’re going to buy shares in Boogle?” A “share” is your small perc entage of ownership of a company. It’s an equal part; if you own more shares , you own more parts of the company. The share is, if you will, the unit of own ership.

Midas says, “That’s right. An IPO is a way for a pr ivately owned company to become a publicly owned one.” If we say something i s “privately owned,” we mean that the average person on the street can’t bu y partial ownership in the company. The company is owned, say, by one family o r one group of investors. “Publicly owned companies” are companies that sell partial ownership, sell stock, in their companies, and these companies have differ ent regulations, different rules they have to follow, because they are publicl y owned.

An initial public offering is a way for a privately  owned company to get more money – for selling more of its product or for doin g research or for expanding the business somehow. Midas says, “The owners of the co mpany do it” – that is, have an IPO – “to raise capital.” “Capital” (capita l) refers to money that is used for some business purpose. “To raise (raise) capita l” means to get more money, to get money from people for some particular busine ss project.

Midas says, “Sometimes the IPOs are for early inves tors to cash in,” or perhaps “to cash in on.” An “early investor” is someone who  gives money for partial ownership in the company when the company is still relatively new or young. A privately owned company can get money from people w ho help it grow, and then when there’s an IPO and the company’s stock is wort h a lot of money, these

initial investors – these early investors – often c ash in. “To cash in” means to make a lot of money by selling what you have.

So, you sell your shares in the company in order to  get your money back plus a lot of other money. At least, that’s the idea. Zoe then asks, “Why can’t you buy stock in the initial public offering?” Midas says, “A company like Boogle works with an underwriter, like a major investment bank.”  An “underwriter” (underwriter) is an individual – but more commonly, a company – t hat purchases shares from a company and then resells them to people who want to  buy them, to investors.

Usually, this is done through something like an inv estment bank. An “investment bank” is a large bank that has investments and that  helps companies raise capital through selling stocks. Midas says that the  underwriter helps set the share price and find buyers for the initial offering. The  “share price” is how much that one unit of partial ownership is worth, how much it  will cost you. Zoe says, “Okay, I’m following you so far,” meaning I understand wha t you mean up to this point.

Midas continues, “Well, that first sale of stock is  usually done in bulk.” “In bulk” (bulk) means in a large quantity, when you buy a lo t of something at once. Some people, when they see a good sale on, I don’t know,  paper towels or toilet paper or cans of tuna, will buy them in bulk. They’ll buy  lots of them because the price is good. I buy my coffee in bulk whenever it goes o n sale at the grocery store; I buy as many as I can at a cheap price.

That’s what Midas is talking about when he says tha t the sale of stock is done “in bulk,” meaning it’s sold in large quantities. That means that you have to have a lot of money, typically, in order to buy it. Midas says, “I don’t have a few million dollars lying around to buy that much stock.” When we talk about something “lying (lying) around,” we mean available – somethi ng, typically money, that you can just access, get the use of, quickly, that’s no t being used for anything else.

Midas says, “Luckily for me” – fortunately for me –  “those first buyers then turn around and sell that stock in smaller amounts.” The  phrasal verb “to turn around” here means to immediately do something else, usuall y buy or sell. For example, I could buy a new computer today and then turn around  and sell it tomorrow to someone else for a higher price. Or, I could sell m y computer today and turn around tomorrow and buy a new computer. So, it usua lly refers to buying and then selling, or selling and then buying – the two actions being done very close together in time.

Zoe says, “And that’s when you’ll buy?” meaning whe n the initial investors who have a lot of money start selling their stock in sm aller amounts. Midas says,

“That’s right” – that’s correct. “You should get in  on it, too.” Zoe says, “You mean buy some Boogle stock?” Midas says, “Sure, why not? ”

Zoe says, “And risk losing my shirt? No, thanks.” “ To lose (lose) your shirt (shirt)” means to lose all your money, typically in some sor t of investment. You could, for example, loan your money to a friend who’s starting  a business, and then the business is not successful and you don’t get your m oney back. If you loaned him all of your money or most of your money, you could lose your shirt – that is, you could go broke. You could have no money left.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
