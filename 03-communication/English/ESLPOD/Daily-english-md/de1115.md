This episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogue b etween Samantha and a butcher about buying meat. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Butcher: Good morning. What can I get for you?

Samantha: I’d like some lamb chops, pork chops, and  some beef, but I’m not sure which cuts I want yet.

Butcher: You’ve come to the right butcher shop. Eve rything here is fresh. Everything comes straight from the slaughterhouse.

Samantha: Um, I’m glad to hear that.

Butcher: In fact, we got in a shipment of game and poultry just this morning. You can buy them bone-in, boneless, or whole. They’re a s fresh as if you got them from your own farm or brought them down with your o wn shotgun.

Samantha: Uh, that’s great. I see that you sell mar inated and stuffed meats, too.

Butcher: Yes, we do. We even make our own sausages.  We use only the freshest ingredients. They’re so fresh I wouldn’t b e surprised if they got up and walked across the floor.

Samantha: Right. I think I’ll just take the chops f or now.

Butcher: Are you sure? I can show you some of the b est prime cuts of beef you’ll ever see. They’re so fresh you could . . .

Samantha: No, no, that’s all for now. I suddenly fe el like a salad for dinner instead.

[end of dialogue] Our dialogue begins with the butcher saying to Sama ntha, “Good morning. What can I get for you?” A “butcher” (butcher) is a pers on whose job it is to cut meat and usually sell the meat to people who want to buy  it. Technically, the butcher is the person who cuts the meat away from the animal o r cuts the meat into smaller pieces. Samantha is talking to a butcher who is ask ing her what she wants, what kind of meat she wants to buy.

Samantha says, “I’d like some lamb chops, pork chop s, and some beef, but I’m not sure which cuts I want yet.” “Lamb” (lamb) – no tice the “b” is silent when we pronounce the word – is meat that comes from a youn g sheep. A “sheep” is a kind of animal that you also take to hair from in o rder to make clothing. The hair is called “wool” (wool). “Lamb,” then, is meat that  comes from a young sheep.

When we talk about “chops” (chops), we’re referring  to a thick slice of meat, a thick piece of meat that you can cook. Usually, it is made of pork or lamb. We talk about “lamb chops” and “pork chops.” “Pork” is meat  that comes from a pig. Samantha says she wants lamb chops, pork chops, and  some “beef” (beef). “Beef,” you may already know, is meat that comes fr om a cow.

Samantha says she’s not sure which “cuts” she wants  yet. A “cut” (cut) refers here to a section of an animal’s body that we get m eat from. Often we’re talking about specific areas in the animal’s body. An anima l such as a cow has many different sections, and there are four different cu ts of beef that you can get from it. Samantha isn’t sure which cut she wants yet.

The butcher says, “You’ve come to the right butcher  shop.” A “butcher shop” is a store that sells meat and meat products. There aren ’t a lot of butcher shops left in the United States. In most cities, you buy your mea t from a grocery store that sells all kinds of food, but there are still butche r shops. Here in Los Angeles, there’s a butcher shop about two miles from my hous e, but most of the people who buy meat nowadays go to a grocery store, and so  there are butchers who work in grocery stores.

The butcher says, “Everything here is fresh.” To say food is “fresh” means the meat has recently been cut from the animal or that it isn’t old, it isn’t spoiled. The

butcher says, “Everything comes straight from the s laughterhouse.” “To be straight from” means it has come directly from a ce rtain place. It hasn’t been sitting in a warehouse, a storage facility. It has come directly from, in this case, the “slaughterhouse.”

A “slaughterhouse” (slaughterhouse) is a place wher e animals are killed, animals such as pigs and cows and sheep. I grew up in an ag ricultural state in the Midwest, in Minnesota, where there are lots of slau ghterhouses. In fact, there are slaughterhouses, or at least there used to be, not too far from where I lived in St. Paul. The verb “to slaughter” means to kill an anim al, and that’s where you get the word “slaughterhouse.”

Samantha says, “I’m glad to hear that.” She’s glad to hear that the meat is fresh because it comes straight from the slaughterhouse. The butcher continues, “In fact, we got in a shipment of game and poultry just  this morning.” “We got in” means we received. A “shipment” is a large collecti on of something, usually things that are being sold by a store or are being sent to someone who is buying a large number of things.

The butcher is talking about a shipment of “game an d poultry” (poultry). “Game” refers to wild animals or birds that are killed eit her for sport or for food. When I say they’re “wild,” I mean they’re not in a farm – they’re not being raised or brought up to be used as food. They’re animals that  are out in the trees and, well, wherever birds go. “Poultry” refers to a couple of different kinds of animals – “chickens,” “turkeys,” “ducks,” and “geese” are all  what we call “poultry.” They’re birds that are eaten or whose eggs are eaten.

The butcher continues, “You can buy them bone-in, b oneless, or whole.” When you’re buying poultry, sometimes you want the meat to come with the bone still in it – that would be “bone-in.” “Boneless” (boneless)  is when you buy meat, especially poultry meat, without the bone. “Whole” (whole) refers to buying a chicken or a turkey or a duck or a goose without it  being cut up. In other words, you get the whole bird, the whole animal.

Americans love to eat turkey on the celebration in November of our Thanksgiving Day, and most Americans buy a whole turkey and then  cook the whole bird, the whole animal, inside of a large oven. The butcher i s giving Samantha different options for buying the poultry. He continues, “They ’re as fresh as if you got them from your own farm or brought them down with your o wn shotgun.” A “shotgun” (shotgun) is the kind of gun that you can use to ki ll an animal. You can kill a person with a shotgun as well.

Shotguns are used to shoot things at relatively “cl ose range,” or not too far away from you. There’s another kind of gun called a “rif le” (rifle) that would be used to shoot something that’s far away. I myself am not wh at we would call a “hunter.” I don’t go out and kill animals with guns. I did, how ever, once fire a shotgun that a friend of mine owned. He was a hunter. Where I grew  up in Minnesota, lots of people are into or interested in hunting. I was nev er one of those people.

Samantha says, “Uh, that’s great. I see that you se ll marinated and stuffed meats, too.” “Marinated” (marinated) comes from the  verb “to marinate,” which means to put uncooked meat or vegetables into some kind of liquid in order to give it more flavor, to give it a different taste. “Stuffed” (stuffed) comes from the verb “to stuff,” which means to fill a hole or an o pening in a substance.

Sometimes people “stuff” their turkeys. They put th ings inside of the body of the turkey to cook in addition to cooking the actual tu rkey. That’s very common when people prepare turkeys for Thanksgiving. In fact, w e call the food inside “stuffing” (stuffing). We also use that word “stuffing” for a pillow. The things that you stuff inside of the pillow in order to make it soft is ca lled “stuffing” as well.

The butcher says, “Yes, we do” – yes, we do sell ma rinated and stuffed meats. He continues, “We even make our own sausages.” “Sau sage” (sausage) is meat that has been cut up into very small pieces and usu ally mixed with certain spices and perhaps vegetables and then put inside a skin, what we call a “casing” (casing). Basically it’s a tube-like shape of the m eat that you can cook. The butcher is saying that his butcher shop makes its o wn sausages. “We use only the freshest ingredients.”

An “ingredient” is something you use in preparing f ood. It is a food that is part of a larger dish. The ingredients for an omelet, for e xample, would be an egg, cheese, perhaps some kind of meat. The butcher says , “The sausages are so fresh I wouldn’t be surprised if they got up and wa lked across the floor.” The butcher is saying that the sausages are so fresh it ’s almost as if they were alive, as if they could get up and walk. The idea here is that they were killed or the meat that is used in them comes from animals who we re killed very recently.

Samantha says, “Right. I think I’ll just take the c hops for now.” The butcher says, “Are you sure? I can show you some of the best prim e cuts of beef you’ll ever see.” A “prime (prime) cut” of beef, is a top-quali ty one, a very high-quality cut of beef. Samantha says, “No, that’s all for now. I sud denly feel like a salad for dinner instead.” Apparently Samantha didn’t like the butcher reminding her of where this meat comes from, and she says maybe she’ ll have a salad instead of meat for dinner.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
