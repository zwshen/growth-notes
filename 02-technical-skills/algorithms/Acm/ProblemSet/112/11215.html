<h1>Problem H</h1>
<h2>How Many Numbers?</h2>
</center>

<p>You might have heard the game of 24: given 4 integers, you're to make an expression to get 
the number 24. For example, given 4, 4, 10, 10, you can write (10*10-4)/4=24, given 1, 5, 5, 5, 
you can write (5-1/5)*5=24. </p>

<p>In this problem, your task is a little bit harder: count the number of numbers that can be 
made. Don't forget to count negative numbers and non-integers. You can use binary additions, 
subtractions, multiplications and divisions with parenthesis (unary operations are not allowed). 
Numbers cannot be concatenated to form a larger number (e.g. you cannot concatenate 1 and 2 to get 12).</p>

<p>For example, given two 1's, exactly 3 numbers can be made: 1+1=2, 1-1=0, 1*1=1. You cannot get 11 or -1.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
The input consists of at most 30 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing a single 
integer <i>n</i> (1 < <i>n</i> < 7), the number of integers given. The next line contains <i>n</i> 
non-negative integers not greater than 10. The last case is followed by a single zero, which 
should not be processed.

<h2>Output</h2>
For each test case, print the case number and the number of numbers that can be made.

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
2
1 1
3
1 4 7
4
1 2 3 5
0
</pre>

<h2>Output for the Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
Case 1: 3
Case 2: 47
Case 3: 255
</pre>
