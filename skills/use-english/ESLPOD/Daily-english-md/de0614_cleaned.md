This episode is a dialogue between Jamal and Keisha.  Th ey’re talking about something which is very common to many parts of the world,  including Los Angeles: earthquakes.  We’ll go over some of the vocabula ry related to that topic. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Jamal:  Did you feel that?   

Keisha:  Was that an earthquake?   

Jamal:  Yes, I think so.  Turn on the news.   

Newscaster:  “Reports are coming in about an earthquake  that occurred at 4:35 p.m. in the downtown area.  We spoke with a seismologi st at the Earthquake Center and learned that the earthquake had a magnitu de of 3.2 on the Richter scale.  The epicenter was near downtown, along one of t he major faults, and the seismologist warns that there will be some aftershocks.” 

Keisha:  Phew!  I’m glad the earthquake wasn’t a high -intensity one.  I wish they could predict more accurately when those earthquakes are go ing to happen.   

Jamal:  Yeah, me, too.  I’ve looked around the house an d don’t see any damage, though.  I guess our house won’t be declared a disaster a rea. 

Keisha:  Don’t be too sure.  Considering the mess you’ve m ade in kitchen, it could easily be called a disaster area.    

 Jamal:  In that case, will you be sending aid?  I think I’m too tired to do the dishes. 

Keisha:  You won’t be getting any aid from me.  If you ’re hoping for a relief effort, you’d better ask the UN. 

[end of dialogue] 

Jamal begins by saying, “Did you feel that?”  Keisha says, “ Was that an earthquake?”  An “earthquake” is a short period of time  when the ground shakes or moves because there is some sort of what we would call g eological movement underneath the ground.  Most places that experience ear thquakes often have earthquakes that are very small or minor.  I feel an ear thquake here in Los Angeles maybe once a year, usually it’s small, maybe twice a  year.  It depends on where you live exactly, but that’s about average, alth ough there are many small earthquakes that most people don’t feel that are taking place all the time, at least that’s what I’ve read. 

Keisha asks if it was an earthquake; she wasn’t sure.  Usuall y you can tell. Sometimes if you look over at, for example, a lamp and you see the string that you use to turn on the lamp is moving back and forth, wel l that’s a sign that there was something that moved the whole house or the whole a partment.  Jamal says, “Yes, I think so (I think it was an earthquake).  Tur n on the news,” meaning turn on the radio or the television to see if there i s a news report.  Nowadays, we would probably just turn on the computer and look on th e Internet. 

Next, a newscaster, who sounds surprisingly like Jamal, gives  us the news.  A “newscaster” is someone on the television or that you hear on radio that reads the news to you – tells you what the news is.  The newscas ter says, “Reports (information) are coming in about an earthquake that  occurred at 4:35 p.m. in the downtown area.”  “Reports are coming in” means we are receiving information from different places.  The earthquake “occurred” (it ha ppened; it took place) at 4:35 p.m., in the afternoon, in the downtown area.  “We spoke with a seismologist at the Earthquake Center and learned that the earthquake had a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.”  A “seismologist”  (seismologist) is a scientist who studies earthquakes – who studies the movemen ts of the earth. Here in Southern California there are seismologists at  California Institute of Technology, or what we call here Cal Tech, and usually af ter an earthquake there is a seismologist that is interviewed from this are a – this university research center.  Here, the seismologist is interviewed and says that  the earthquake had a  

 magnitude of 3.2.  “Magnitude” (magnitude) is how bi g or small something is; it’s the size of something, usually used in talking about thin gs like earthquakes.  Or, it can also be used to describe a problem: “The magnitud e of the problem is huge (is large).”  The magnitude of the earthquake is how p owerful it is, and there’s a way of measuring this called the Richter scale.  The “Ri chter,” which is the name of the person who helped invent it, is a system for measur ing the size of earthquakes.  A 3.2 is not a serious earthquake.  If it ’s 5-6-7, these are large and potentially very damaging earthquakes – earthquakes that co uld cause a lot of damage: people getting hurt, buildings falling down,  and so forth.   

Well, this was a small earthquake, a 3.2.  “The epicente r,” the newscaster continues, “was near downtown.”  The “epicenter” (epicen ter) is where the earthquakes started; it’s like the center of the earthqua ke, the place in the ground where it started.  Earthquakes are caused, as you probably know, by the movement of what we call tectonic plates.  These are part s of the earth that move back, or can move back and forth and that creates the m ovement, which is the earthquake.  The epicenter was downtown – near dow ntown along one of the major faults.  A “fault” (fault) here means or is short  for a “fault line,” which is a crack or a long hole in the earth, where the earth is m oving away from each other so it opens up the earth.  That’s a fault – that’s the manifestation, I should say, of a fault; that’s how you can see where a fault is, but t here isn’t necessarily a hole in the ground right where the fault is.  There are e arthquake faults – areas that would likely have an earthquake all around Southern Cal ifornia, as well as Northern California – although we’re less interested i n them!  The biggest fault here is called the San Andreas fault.  “Fault” has some other meanings in English, very different meanings, and those can be found  in the Learning Guide. 

The newscaster continues by saying that the seismologist warn s that there will be some aftershocks.  “Aftershocks” (one word) are small ea rthquakes that happen after a large earthquake.  So when there’s a l arge earthquake, the earth isn’t done moving – it hasn’t stopped moving completely t ypically, and there are additional earthquakes that could happen an hour, two hours, perhaps even days from the original, large earthquake. 

Now we’re back to Keisha and Jamal.  Keisha says, “Phew!” w hich is just a way of expressing relief.  “Phew!  I’m glad the earthquake wasn’t a high-intensity one.”  “High-intensity” means a strong, a powerful one.   It lasts usually a short time, but it is very powerful.  This was not a high-int ensity earthquake.  Keisha says, “I wish they could predict more accurately when those ea rthquakes are going to happen.”  “To predict” means to say what is goi ng to happen in the future.  Seismologists are trying to get better at pre dicting when earthquakes will  

 take place so that they can warn people in advance, but un fortunately the science is not yet sufficiently advanced to do that.   

Jamal says, “Yeah, me, too,” meaning I agree, I wish also  the seismologists could predict more accurately.  Jamal says, “I’ve looked arou nd the house and I don’t see any damage (any harm).”  “Damage” is what resu lts when things are broken or destroyed.  He says, “I guess our house won’t be declared a disaster area.”  “To be declared” is a formal way of saying to b e officially named something or to be put in a certain category.  A “disast er area” is an area where there has been a lot of damage – people have been hur t; people have died – usually because of what we would call a natural disaster.  A “disaster” (disaster) is when there is a large event that harms or hurts many people or causes a lot of damage.  Sometimes we use “disaster” to describe a situat ion where everything went wrong: “How was your date last night with Julie?” and you say, “Oh, it was a disaster!  She talked about her ex-boyfriend the whole night.”  Here, however, “disaster” is used in the more traditional way.  In the United States when there is a lot of damage due to a natural disaster, which wou ld be an earthquake, a flood, tornadoes, a hurricane, anything that is caused by the for ces of nature, the government will sometimes declare an area a disaster area , and that makes it eligible – that qualifies it – that means that it can  receive additional money and help from the government. 

Jamal says that the house is not damaged and will not be declared a disaster area.  Keisha says, “Don’t be too sure.  Considering the mess you’ve made in kitchen, it could easily be called a disaster area.”  Her e, we’re seeing the other use of the word “disaster” to describe a very negative situ ation.  In this case, Jamal has made a mess – he has made the kitchen dirty, and  that, Keisha says, is also a disaster area.  Jamal, joking of course, says, “In that case, will you be sending aid?”  “Aid” (aid) is help.  In a disaster it’ s usually food, medical supplies, other things that a country needs or an area needs after  a disaster: drinking water, money, and so forth.  To “send aid,” then, woul d be to send those things to the disaster area.   

Jamal is joking, saying that he needs aid to clean up the  kitchen.  He says, “I think I’m too tired to do the dishes.”  Keisha says, “Yo u won’t be getting any aid from me (I’m not going to help you).  If you’re hopi ng for a relief effort, you’d better ask the UN.”  “Relief” (relief) is a change in  a situation, in a bad situation things get better.  “Relief efforts” are when organiza tions and governments try to organize aid.  They have a committee – they have leaders t hat organize the money, the food, the medical supplies, and other things .  Usually after a major disaster – and there have been unhappily many in recent ye ars – there is a relief  

 effort organized by different countries, by organization s such as the Red Cross. The “UN” is the United Nations, which of course is the la rge international organization that tries to solve problems among nations, as well as help when there is a disaster.  Keisha, continuing the joke, says tha t there is going to be no relief effort and that Jamal should ask the United Nat ions to help him with the disaster area he created in the kitchen. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
