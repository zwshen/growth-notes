This episode is called “After Christmas Sales,” whe n you go to the store and they reduce or lower the price to get rid of the things that people didn’t buy for the Christmas holidays.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roxana:  Get up!  We’re going to miss out on the be st deals if we don’t get to the stores when they open.

Kurt:  What?  I’m sleeping.  Leave me alone.

Roxana:  You need to get up now and come with me to  the store for the after Christmas sales.  You know that they slash prices a nd everything is on sale.

Kurt:  We just spent the past few weeks shopping for Christmas presents and now you want to shop some more?

Roxana:  We can stock up for next year.  There’ll b e deep discounts on all of the Christmas decorations and supplies, not to mention all of the winter clothing and seasonal toys.  Let’s go!

Kurt:  You go.  What do you need me for?

Roxana:  I need you to run interference while I go for the best bargains and to hold all of the bags and packages while I shop.  What else?

Kurt:  When I agreed to “for better or for worse,” I didn’t anticipate this!

[end of dialogue]

 Roxana begins by saying to Kurt, “Get up!”  “Get up ” means usually to stand up from sitting or from lying down.  Normally we use t his when we’re talking to someone who is lying in bed.  They may not be sleep ing, but they are not yet out of the bed, so we say “get up.”  You may ask someon e, “What time did you get up this morning?”  They may reply, “Well, I woke up  (meaning I went from sleeping to not sleeping) at 6:00, but I got up at 6:30; I laid in bed for a half an hour.”

So, Roxana is telling Kurt to get up.  She says, “W e’re going to miss out on the best deals if we don’t get to the stores when they open.”  “To miss out on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to not be ab le to participate in something, usually something good; to not be able to have a go od opportunity to get something, usually because you didn’t know about it  or perhaps it wasn’t possible for you to be there.  “Did you go to Bill’s birthda y party yesterday?”  “No, I missed out on that.  I had to work.”  I didn’t have the op portunity to go – besides I don’t really like Bill.  Well, you don’t have to say that .

Roxanne doesn’t want to miss out on the best deals.   A “deal” (deal) is another term for a “bargain” (bargain), that’s when the pri ce of something is lower than it is normally.  I was telling my wife the other day t hat they had the Mercedes Benz car – automobile – that I like on sale.  It was a d eal; instead of being 100,000 dollars it was only 80,000 dollars.  She laughed at  me, of course, that would be crazy.  But, it is a deal, and that’s what I told h er!

Well, Roxana wants to get the best deals, and she n eeds to go to the stores as soon as they open, because what happens here, as I guess in many places, when the stores are selling things cheap people wil l go to the store as early as possible, often waiting outside of the store until it opens.  Kurt says, “What?  I’m sleeping.  Leave me alone.”  Stop bothering me.  Ro xana – I guess she has an “a” at the end of her name – says, “You need to get  up now and come with me to the store for the after Christmas sales.”  The “aft er Christmas sales” are the sales that stores have after December 25 th , which is Christmas Day; they try to sell the things that people didn’t buy for Christmas.  She s ays, “You know that they slash prices and everything is on sale.”  “To slash” (sla sh) means to cut; “to slash prices” means to cut or lower prices.  From 100,000  to 80,000 they slashed the price.  What a deal!  “Everything,” Roxana says, “i s on sale.”  “To be on sale” means to be sold at a price that is lower than what  you normally sell it at.

Well, Kurt isn’t happy.  He says, “We just spent the past few weeks shopping for Christmas presents and now you want to shop some mo re?”  He’s incredulous; that is, he can’t believe that is what Roxana wants  to do.  But Roxana has an

answer.  She says, “We can stock up for next year.”   “To stock (stock) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to go to the store an d buy a lot of something for the future.  You don’t need it right now, but you’r e getting a lot of it in case there’s a problem in the future, or perhaps because the pri ce is good now; it’s on sale, you can buy it cheaply.  People sometimes go and st ock up on toilet paper and perhaps bottled water, or anything that they know t hat they can use in the future, and that you can keep for a long time – you can sto re it, you can put it in a closet and not worry about it.  Roxana wants to stock up f or next year – next Christmas. She says, “There’ll be deep discounts on all of the  Christmas decorations and supplies.”  A “discount” is when you lower the pric e.  A “deep discount” is when you lower the price a lot; it’s the same as “slashi ng prices,” you go from a dollar to 25 cents, that’s a “deep discount,” a big discou nt.

The discounts will be on Christmas decorations.  “D ecorations” are things that you use, you put up in a room to remind someone of the holiday.  Christmas decorations would include in the United States a Ch ristmas tree perhaps, though that usually isn’t something that would go on sale after Christmas – well, I guess it would, but it won’t keep until next year, unless  you buy an artificial tree, a tree that isn’t real.  We had one of those when I was gr owing up; never had a real Christmas tree, actually.  Anyway, “decorations” are things that people put up, maybe little Santa Clauses or other things associat ed with the Christmas holiday that people put in their homes and outside of their  homes.  Here in the United States, a lot of people put lights on the outside of their house during Christmas. My neighbor just put lights on his house.  I have n ever done that; I’m a little too lazy to do that, I think.  Anyway, these are exampl es of Christmas decorations. She says, “not to mention all of the winter clothin g and seasonal toys.  Let’s go!” Something that is “seasonal” is related to a specif ic season or time of the year. We talk about the four seasons: winter, spring, sum mer, and fall.  But, “seasonal” can also refer to a time or a period of time relate d to some event; in this case, it would be the Christmas season, which in the United States begins in late November and ends in late December.  These are the toys that Roxana wants to buy – seasonal toys.  I’m not sure exactly what the y would be.

Kurt says, “You go.  What do you need me for?”  Rox ana says, “I need you to run interference while I go for the best bargains and t o hold all of the bags and packages while I shop.  What else?”  “To run interf erence” is to help another person by protecting him or her from other people, or perhaps from criticism by other people.  It’s a term that we sometimes use in  American football to talk about the people who are stopping the opposing team  from tackling or putting to the ground one of your players.  “To run interferen ce” here means, I think, that Kurt would go and prevent other people, perhaps, fr om getting to the things that Roxana wants to buy.  It’s something of a joke, I g uess.  She says she is going to

go for the best bargains.  A “bargain” (bargain), w e mentioned already, is a deal, when you have a good price on something – a low pri ce on something.  So again, Roxana says to Kurt, “I need you to run inte rference while I go for the best bargains and to hold all of the bags and packages w hile I shop.  What else?” This expression “What else?” is an informal one use d when you think that what you are explaining to someone is very obvious; it’s  as though you shouldn’t have even asked the question, it’s so obvious you should  know the answer already. Of course, Roxana wants Kurt to hold all of the bag s and packages while she goes and buys some more.

Kurt says, “When I agreed to ‘for better or for wor se,’ I didn’t anticipate this!”  The expression “for better or for worse” is often used at a wedding ceremony.  When two people are getting married they make promises t o each other; these are formally called “vows” (vows), and part of the trad itional vow in English that is said at a wedding is that you will stay with your h usband or wife “for richer or for poorer.”  The “for” is sort of poetic; it means eve n if you are rich or poor.  “For richer or for poorer, for better or for worse,” mea ning if things go well or if things go badly you’re still going to stay with that perso n, and at the end you say, “till death do us part,” meaning till both of us die or, well, one of us dies.  That doesn’t happen in a lot of marriages, but that’s wh at people promise, they just don’t keep their promises.  Kurt says, “I didn’t an ticipate this!”  “To anticipate” means to predict, to believe something will happen in a certain way in the future. Kurt is saying that when he got married to Roxana h e didn’t think that he would have to get up early for the after Christmas sales.   And, well, I guess he wasn’t thinking very clearly when he got married!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Roxana:  Get up!  We’re going to miss out on the be st deals if we don’t get to the stores when they open.

Kurt:  What?  I’m sleeping.  Leave me alone.
