This episode is called “Planting a Garden.”  It’s going to be conversation between Joni and Giuseppe talking about planting things in your  back yard in back of your house in the ground so that they will grow.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Joni:  Smell that!

Giuseppe:  Smell what?

Joni:  Smell that fresh air.  Aren’t you glad I got you  to help me plant this garden? We’re going to have so much fun today.

Giuseppe:  Uh huh.  I’m glad to help, but I don’t exa ctly have a green thumb.

Joni:  That’s okay.  As long as you can tell a shovel from a lawn mower, you’ll be fine.  Let’s start by moving these pots next to the bushes.

Giuseppe:  Okay, your wish is my command.

Joni:  Oh, this bag of fertilizer is so heavy.

Giuseppe:  Let me get that.

Joni:  Thanks.  I didn’t know we had so many large bags of  seeds, too.

Giuseppe:  Do you want me to help you with those?

Joni:  Thanks a lot.  I’ll also need someone to help me hoe this soil.

 Giuseppe:  I guess I could do that.

Joni:  And how am I going to pull all of these weeds?

Giuseppe:  Honestly, I think we need reinforcements.

Joni:  Good idea.  You start working and I’ll go see i f I can round up more help. [She leaves.]

Giuseppe:  I start working while she leaves?  Hmm…I thin k she just pulled a fast one on me.

Our dialogue begins with Joni saying to Giuseppe, “Smel l that!”  “Smell” meaning take your nose and try to smell it.  Giuseppe says, “Smell what?”  Joni says, “Smell that fresh air.”  The “fresh air” is air outside  that smells good; it smells clean.  Joni says, “Aren’t you glad I got you to help m e plant this garden?  We’re going to have so much fun today.”  To “plant,” here, me ans to put seeds in the ground so that the plants will grow.  A “garden” is u sually a small piece of land that is used to grow plants, usually flowers or vegetables,  perhaps fruit.

Joni says that she thinks they’re going to have so much (or a  lot of) fun today. Giuseppe says, “Uh huh.”  That expression, “uh huh,” means  you don’t really agree with the person; you’re saying yes but you don’t mean yes, or you mean yes but you aren’t very enthusiastic about it. Giuseppe says, “I’m glad to help, but I don’t exactly have a green thumb.”  The expression “to h ave a green thumb” means that you can make things grow well, you can make pla nts and flowers – things in the ground – you can make them grow; you are g ood at that sort of thing.

Joni says, “That’s okay.  As long as you can tell a shovel fro m a lawn mower, you’ll be fine.”  To “tell something from something el se” means to distinguish or to differentiate something from something else.  It mean s to see or understand the difference between two things.  If you’re looking at a bird you may say, “I can’t tell a male bird from a female bird.”  Hopefully you won’t  have that problem with humans!  “I can’t distinguish one from the other.”

So Joni says, “As long as you can tell a shovel from a lawn mower, you’ll be fine.”  A “shovel” (shovel) is a tool for working in a g arden, for example.  You have one long wooden piece that you hold onto, and the n usually a flat piece of metal that you push into the ground in order, for exa mple, to make a hole.  A

 “lawn mower” is a machine, usually that has an engine po wered by gasoline, that’s used to cut the lawn (to cut the grass).  So, Joni is saying as long as you know the difference between a shovel and a lawn mower,  you’ll be fine.

She says, “Let’s start by moving these pots next to the bushe s.”  A “pot” is a round container that holds dirt and usually has one or more plants that are planted in this dirt.  So it’s a container for growing  plants.  “Pot” has a couple of different meanings that are not explained in our Learning Guide – so don’t look there for any further explanations!

Joni wants to put the pots next to the bushes.  These are not the people who may have lived in the White House!  The “bushes” are lar ge, short plants that have many branches and leaves.  Giuseppe says, “Okay, your wish  is my command.”  This is an old expression: “your wish (what you want) is my command.”  I will do whatever you want me to do, that’ s the meaning of this expression: “Your wish is my command.”  It might be somethi ng a servant would say to a king or a queen, so there’s a little bit of come dy – a little bit of a joke when someone says this.

Joni then says, “Oh, this bag of fertilizer is so heavy.”  “ Fertilizer” is something that you put on the ground to make the dirt (the soil ) better so that you can grow your plants better and more quickly.  Usually fertilizer i s made from either chemicals or animal waste; that’s why fertilizer often ha s a very bad smell to it.

Giuseppe says, “Let me get that” – let me lift that up.   Joni says, “Thanks.  I didn’t know we had so many large bags of seeds, too.”  A “seed” is a small, hard piece of the plant that you put into the ground to make a new plant grow.  Giuseppe says, “Do you want me to help you with those?”  Joni says, “Thanks a lot,” meaning yes, thank you.  She says, “I also need someone t o help me hoe this soil.”  To “hoe” (hoe) means to use a special tool that has a long wooden piece that you hold onto and a piece of metal that is used to  scrape.  So it’s kind of like a shovel but smaller.  Joni wants Giuseppe to help her ho e the soil.  The “soil” is the dirt, the earth where you plant these seeds.

Giuseppe says, “I guess I could do that.”  Joni says, “And ho w am I going to pull all of those weeds?”  To “pull,” here, means to remove.   “Weeds” are plants that you don’t want.  They’re things that you don’t want to grow but are growing next to the plants that you do want.  So these are called “weeds.”  “Weed,” like the word “pot,” can also refer to marijuana, which is anoth er kind of plant that you smoke – or at least that’s what I have been told!

 Giuseppe says, “Honestly, I think we need reinforcements.”  “Reinforcements” is something or someone that helps with a project and make s it stronger or makes something stronger.  In this case, it means more people : “I think we need more people to help us.”

Joni says, “Good idea.  You start working and I’ll go see if I can round up more help.”  To “round up” something, in this sentence, me ans to find or bring something or someone.  “I’m going to go round up some of my friends” – I’m going to go out and find them and bring them back.  T o “round up” is a phrasal verb that has a couple of different meanings in English .  This time you can  go to the Learning Guide to find some additional explanati ons!

Well, Joni then leaves and Giuseppe says, “I start working while she leaves? Hmm…I think she just pulled a fast one on me.”  To “pu ll a fast one on someone” means to trick someone, to make someone do something that  he normally wouldn’t want to do, or to make someone believe somethi ng that isn’t true. That’s to “pull a fast one.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Joni:  Smell that!

Giuseppe:  Smell what?

Joni:  Smell that fresh air.  Aren’t you glad I got you  to help me plant this garden? We’re going to have so much fun today.

Giuseppe:  Uh huh.  I’m glad to help, but I don’t exa ctly have a green thumb.

Joni:  That’s okay.  As long as you can tell a shovel from a lawn mower, you’ll be fine.  Let’s start by moving these pots next to the bushes.

Giuseppe:  Okay, your wish is my command.

Joni:  Oh, this bag of fertilizer is so heavy.

Giuseppe:  Let me get that.

Joni:  Thanks.  I didn’t know we had so many large bags of  seeds, too.

 Giuseppe:  Do you want me to help you with those?

Joni:  Thanks a lot.  I’ll also need someone to help me hoe this soil.

Giuseppe:  I guess I could do that.

Joni:  And how am I going to pull all of these weeds?

Giuseppe:  Honestly, I think we need reinforcements.

Joni:  Good idea.  You start working and I’ll go see i f I can round up more help. [She leaves.]

Giuseppe:  I start working while she leaves?  Hmm…I thin k she just pulled a fast one on me.
