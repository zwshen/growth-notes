This episode is called “Preparing Food for Cooking.”  It ’s going to describe a lot of common vocabulary we use in English to talk about cookin g food.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Marissa:  How can I help? 

Juan Carlos:  Um...why don’t you iron the tablecloth and  set the table? 

Marissa:  I already did that.  I want to help with the  cooking.   

Juan Carlos:  Okay, you can scrub these potatoes, peel the ca rrots, and rinse these grapes. 

Marissa:  All right, I’ll do that, but I think you’re just giving me the scut work.  I want to do some real cooking. 

Juan Carlos:  Well okay, I guess you could cut up this chicken and then chop these vegetables.  After that, you can sauté the vegetable s in this pan. 

Marissa:  Great!  Now, how do you sauté?  I’ve never don e it before. 

Juan Carlos:  What?!  Forget it.  You can steam the vege tables instead. 

Marissa:  Okay, just show me how.   

 Juan Carlos:  Never mind.  Here, just beat these eggs and  slice these onions. When you’re done, you can toss that salad.   

Marissa:  But I want to whip up some gourmet dishes.  W hen can I cook? 

Juan Carlos:  That’s a good question.  Ask me again when you’ve learned how! 

[end of dialogue] 

The dialogue between Marissa and Juan Carlos begins by Ma rissa saying, “How can I help you,” which is a polite way of someone saying in  what way can I be of assistance – how can I help you with what you are doing.  Juan Carlos says, “Um...why don’t you iron the tablecloth and set the ta ble?”  Juan Carlos is cooking the food and his wife, I guess, is asking if she can help him.  Juan Carlos says, “why don’t you iron the tablecloth?”  “To iron” mea ns to take a piece of clothing or a piece of fabric and put a hot object on i t so that it is straight and smooth; it does not have any what we would call “wrinkle s,” or lines in it.  “To iron” is a verb; there’s also the noun “iron,” which is the thing that you heat up, usually nowadays by plugging it in.  It’s an electrical devi ce.  The “tablecloth” is a large cloth – a large piece of fabric that you put over  a table, usually for some sort of formal dining situation.  If you go to a nice r estaurant they will usually have tablecloths.  Juan Carlos also suggests that she set the ta ble.  “To set the table” means to put the plates, cups, napkins, spoons, forks, knives – all of those sorts of things that you need to eat on the table.  Usually,  this is something you do before the person brings out the food to eat.  In my f amily, growing up, it was always my job to set the table for dinner.  Probably beca use that’s the easiest thing for a child to do, and not being the brightest person, my parent’s didn’t want me to make any mistakes! 

So, Juan Carlos is asking Marissa to help him.  Marissa says, “I already did that. I want to help with the cooking.”  Juan Carlos says, “Okay, here, you cook the rest of the meal” – no, he doesn’t say that!  He actual ly says, “Okay, you can help, you can scrub these potatoes.”  “To scrub” (scrub) mea ns to move your hand or use some sort of tool and move it back and forth  against something quickly in order to clean it.  So, scrubbing the vegetabl es is putting them under water, rubbing them so that the dirt comes off of them .  Juan Carlos is asking Marissa to scrub the potatoes, peel the carrots, and rinse  these grapes.  “To peel” (peel) is a verb we use in cooking to talk about removing the skin from a fruit or vegetable, to remove the outside of something  usually with a small knife. So, to peel the carrots would mean to use a small knife  or a sharp object that we  

 would call a “peeler” to take off the outer layer – t he outer skin of the carrot.  A “carrot” is a long, orange-colored vegetable.  “Rinsing”  the grapes means cleaning them by running water over them.  “Grapes” are , of course, small pieces of fruit from which we make wine – or one way of makin g wine, anyway.  You can use that same verb, “to rinse,” when you are talking abou t, for example, washing your hair.  I could say, “I rinsed my hair this morning wh en I took a shower.”  I could say that, but I don’t have any hair so that would b e a lie! 

Marissa says, “All right, I’ll do that, but I think you’re  just giving me the scut work.” “Scut (scut) work” means work that is the most unpleasant to do, the worst job. Someone who gives you scut work is giving you something tha t is usually easy but it’s not very pleasant – it’s not very fun to do.  M arissa says, “I want to do some real cooking.”  Juan Carlos says, “Well okay, I guess you  could cut up this chicken.”  “To cut something up,” or “to cut up something ” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to cut something into smaller pieces, usually with a knife.  “Cut” has several different meanings in English; take a look at  our Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Juan Carlos also asks Marissa to chop these vegetables.  “To cho p” (chop) also means to cut something into smaller pieces, usually with a  knife, and with a very quick motion – quick, “repetitive,” we would say, motion; you repeat the same thing over and over again.  So, if you have an onion a nd you want the onion to be in very small, little pieces, you would use a knife and you  would chop the onion; you would move the knife up and down quickly several times,  using the same motion to cut the onion.  “Chop” usually means that you  are making something into very small pieces – you are cutting it into small pie ces. 

Juan Carlos says, “After that, you can sauté the vegetabl es in this pan.”  “To sauté” (sauté – with an accent over the “e” because it’s a  word that comes originally from French) means to cook something, often ve getables or meat, in hot oil or butter until it is either soft if it’s veget ables, or browned if it’s meat. Sauté is usually done in a “pan,” which is the thing you put on top of the fire in order to cook food.  Sautéing is usually something that is done very quickly in the pan. 

Marissa says, “Great!  Now, how do you sauté,” meaning how  does one sauté – how does someone who cooks sauté.  “I’ve never done it bef ore.”  Juan Carlos says, “What?!  Forget it,” meaning he can’t believe Mari ssa doesn’t know how to sauté.  He says, “You can steam the vegetables instead.”  “ To steam” (steam) something means to cook something by putting it over boil ing water.  It isn’t in the  

 water; it’s in something else, but the heat from the b oiling water – the vapor – comes up into the food and cooks it, into the pan or wha tever it is that you are using to put the food in.  But, “steaming” means that you don’t put it in water, but the heat of the water cooks the food.  We often steam vegetables, for example. You could also steam fish. 

Juan Carlos is asking Marissa to steam the vegetables, and M arissa says, “Okay, just show me how” – tell me how to do it.  Juan C arlos says, “Never mind,” meaning forget it, don’t worry about it, I do n’t want you to do it.  He says, “Here, just beat these eggs and slice these onions.”  “To beat” an egg, or to beat anything in cooking means to stir something very quickly; to mix it very quickly, often in order to put more air into the food.  “Bea t” has several different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Juan Carlos wants Marissa also to “slice these onions.”  “To  slice” (slice) is another verb we use to refer to cutting something.  Thi s is when you cut something into very thin, flat pieces.  So, you might sl ice the bread.  You have a piece of bread, what we would call a “loaf” (loaf) of  bread, and then you slice it – you cut it so that it is in thin, flat pieces.  “When you’ re done,” Juan Carlos says, “you can toss that salad.”  “To toss” (toss) something is to  mix things together – mix different pieces of food together, to stir them tog ether.  When you toss a salad, you take all of the elements – all of the ingred ients, the food that makes up the salad, and you mix them together. 

Marissa says, “But I want to whip up some gourmet dishes.  When can I cook?” “To whip up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to mak e something to eat very quickly, in very little time.  Someone says, “Oh, I’ll whi p up some food for dinner,” they mean they will cook food very quickly or get dinner rea dy very quickly. “Gourmet” (gourmet) means very good tasting, delicious, h igh quality food. “Gourmet dishes” refer to the food that you are cooking .  A “dish” is one type of cooked or prepared food.  At Thanksgiving in the United States, we have different dishes: turkey, potatoes, pumpkin pie – these a re dishes. 

Marissa wants to whip up some gourmet dishes.  Juan Carlo s says, “Ask me again when you’ve learned how!” because Marissa doesn’t k now how to do even the most basic things in cooking – kind of like me! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue]  

 Marissa:  How can I help? 

Juan Carlos:  Um...why don’t you iron the tablecloth and  set the table? 

Marissa:  I already did that.  I want to help with the  cooking.

Juan Carlos:  Well okay, I guess you could cut up this chicken and then chop these vegetables.  After that, you can sauté the vegetable s in this pan. 

Marissa:  Great!  Now, how do you sauté?  I’ve never don e it before. 

Juan Carlos:  What?!  Forget it.  You can steam the vege tables instead. 

Marissa:  Okay, just show me how.
