On this episode, we’re going to have a dialogue between Luc and Angela called “To Forgive and Forget.”  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Luc:  You’ll never guess who called and left a voicemail message today.  Angela:  Who?  Luc:  Barbara!  Angela:  Oh, really?  What did she want?  Luc:  She said she was calling to RSVP for our party this Saturday.  Angela:  Did she?    Luc:  Stop playing innocent with me.  Did you or did you not invite her to our party this Saturday?  Angela:  I may have.  Okay, I did.  Luc:  Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t you and Barbara have a knock-down, drag-out fight last month?  Angela:  We may have.  Luc:  And didn’t you say that you’d never speak to her again much less invite her over to our house?
