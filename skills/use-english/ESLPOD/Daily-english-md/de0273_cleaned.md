This episode is called “Telling Secrets to Parents,” and it's a conversation between a brother and a sister, and has some good vocabulary that we would use in a family.  Let's get started.  > Therese:  I can’t believe you told Mom and Dad about me driving the car last Saturday when I wasn’t supposed to.  I thought we had a deal.  You wouldn’t tell on me and I’d take you and Kathy to the movies this weekend.  You’re such a tattletale.  Stephen:  I swear it wasn’t me!  Why would I tell?  We do have a deal and I’ve held up my end.    Therese:  Forget it.  The deal is off.  There’ll be no movie this weekend.    Stephen:  Hey, I told you it wasn’t me who spilled the beans.  Are you sure it wasn’t Jeffrey?  Therese:  Don’t try to put the blame on somebody else.  I know it was you.  Stephen:  How?  Therese:  You’re a terrible liar.    Stephen:  Well, if I did tell on you, I didn’t mean to do it.  Come on, please!  I really want to see that movie this weekend.  What can I do?
