# Returning a DVD Player

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 101: Returning a DVD Player.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 101. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to talk about returnin g a DVD player to a store. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

I bought a new DVD player last weekend. When I got home and hooked it up, I realized that it was defective. I trudged back to t he store to return it.

Clerk: Next, please.

Jeff: Hi, I bought this DVD player last Saturday an d I'd like to return it.

Clerk: What's the reason for the return?

Jeff: It's not working properly.

Clerk: What's the matter with it?

Jeff: Well, several things. First of all, the remot e doesn't work.

Clerk: Did you put batteries in it?

Jeff: Yes, of course, but it still didn't work. I c ouldn't change any of the functions on the display. It also doesn't fast forward when I 'm playing a DVD. It rewinds but it won't fast forward while the picture is playing.  On top of that, I couldn't get the closed caption feature to work.

Clerk: Okay, I see. Anything else?

Jeff: Yes, as you can see, the casing scratches ver y easily. I just took it out of the box and put it on my entertainment unit and I got a ll of these scratches.

Clerk: Oh, are you sure you didn't scratch it with your keys or set some things on top of it?

Jeff: No, I'm sure.

Clerk: Well, I'm sure that it's just a problem with  this one player. I've never seen this with any of the models made by this brand. Do you have the receipt?

Jeff: Yes, here it is.

Clerk: Do you want to exchange it or return it?

Jeff: I'd like to return it.

Clerk: Okay, how did you pay for it?

Jeff: With a credit card.

Clerk: Can I see your card? Okay, I'll credit it ba ck to your credit card. Can you fill out this form with your name and phone number, and sign at the bottom?

Jeff: Sure.

Clerk: Great. Here's your credit card back and $95 has been credited to your credit card. Anything else I can help you with?

Jeff: Oh, there is one more thing. Can you tell me if you carry iPod Nanos?

[end of dialogue]

In this podcast, we are returning a DVD, or Digital  Video Disc, player and the reason we’re returning it is that when I came home with it from the store and I “hooked it up,” I realized that it was “defective.”  “To hook something up” means, in this case, to plug it in, to connect it to my te levision. We usually talk about “hooking up” a TV or, “I need to hook up my cable t elevision,” where you have to connect something, two pieces of machinery or two p ieces of electronics, together. You need to be a little careful about thi s expression. The expression is to “hook up something” or “to hook something up.” I f you say, “I’m going to hook up with a person,” that means that you’re going to get romantically involved with that person, so if you say, “I saw a beautiful girl  last night and I want to hook up with her,” that’s a very different, sort of connect ion. The word, “defective,” means broken, or something is wrong with it, so when I re alized the DVD player was

“defective” – means I realize there was a problem w ith the machine. And “defective” is an adjective (defective) we use with  a machine, electronic or mechanical.

I “trudged back” to the store to return it. The ver b “to trudge” (trudge) means I went back, I traveled back, but the idea is that it  was very difficult that I did it perhaps, unwillingly or reluctantly. You can use th is verb, for example, if you’re talking about going through, walking through three feet of snow. “I trudged through the snow,” or “I trudged through the mud. I t was difficult doing the walk.” That’s one way of using it. Here, we’re using it be cause we’re saying it was difficult. It was inconvenient for me to do that.

When I got to the store, the clerk – I waited in li ne and the clerk, the person working at the return or the customer service desk said, “Next please,” meaning next person. And that’s very common when you walk i nto a bank or if you’re standing in line for something, waiting for someone  at an office, a government office. The person working there, in order to call the next person, will say simply, “Next please.” I said I wanted to return or bring b ack, get my money back for the DVD player. The clerk asked me what the reason. “Wh at’s the reason for the return?” And that expression, “What’s the reason fo r,” is followed by a noun. So, “What’s the reason for you returning here?” Notice that “returning” is a gerund, and that is essentially a verb that serves as a nou n, so you can put an “ing” verb after this expression. For example, “What’s the rea son for going to the store?” means why are you going to the store.

I said that the DVD player was “not working properl y,” meaning it wasn’t functioning properly. You probably know that we use  the verb “to work” when we talk about a machine to mean that it’s functioning.  It is doing what it is supposed to do. The opposite of not working – or the opposit e of working would be “broken,” not working. The clerk then asks, “What’s  the matter with it?” “What’s the matter with it?” means what’s the problem with it. Again, this is a very common expression. You’ll hear people say, “What’s the matter with this television?” – means what’s wrong with it, what’s t he problem with it. You can also use this expression for people. “What’s the ma tter with you? Aren’t you happy?” meaning what’s your problem.

I say that there are several problems. One of which  is that the “remote” doesn’t work. The “remote” (remote) is the thing – that lit tle thing that you use to change the channels or to increase the volume or to turn i t on and off. It allows you to sit in your chair and control a machine that’s far away . “To be remote” means to be away from, detached, separate from. Here, it’s used  as a noun, “the remote,” meaning that little thing that you can change the c hannel with. The clerk asks if I

put batteries in it, which, of course, I said I did . I said that I couldn’t change any of the functions on the “display.” When we talk about a DVD or a VCR, they often have “displays,” and the “display” is the little el ectronic screen that you see that shows whether what channel it’s on or whether it’s recording or not. Those are all part of the display.

I said that the DVD didn’t “fast forward.” “To fast  forward” means, of course, to advance, to go forward. It didn’t “rewind” – I’m so rry, it did rewind,” meaning go backwards, so it could go backwards on the DVD but it won’t fast forward while the “picture is playing.” When we say, “the picture  is playing,” you mean here the DVD is playing on the screen. I also said there was  a problem with the “closed caption” feature. “Closed caption,”  two words – “c aption” is (caption) – is what many television stations put on their programming, their shows, so that people who are deaf, people who cannot hear, who are heari ng impaired, we would say, can still read what’s going on, what the people are  saying on the television, and so most televisions in the United States, you can t urn on the closed caption and see the actual words underneath. This by the way, i s a good way to follow American television if you have problems understand ing it. If you have closed caption, sometimes it‘s easier. It’s basically subt itles.

I said that the “casing” scratches very easily. The  “casing” is another word for the case or the cover or outside of a machine. “To scra tch” means that it has little marks on it so that of you put something on top of it, it will leave marks on the metal or the wood or whatever the material is. That ’s a scratch. There’s also a verb “to scratch” and that means to take your hand,  usually, and to rub it against, for example, your skin. “I have to scratch my arm.”  And we “scratch” when something “itches” and “to itch” means that it’s li ke tickling. It’s something that bothers you, usually on your skin, so it can be a v erb or a noun. Here, it’s a noun and I say that I put the DVD on my “entertainment u nit” and I got all these scratches. Your “entertainment unit” is a big cabin et where usually you have a television and a video player and a DVD player. It’ s a place where – perhaps a radio – where you keep all these things in one big cabinet or -- usually -- sometimes with doors, sometimes without doors.

The clerk said she had not seen any problems with m odels by this “brand.” A “brand” (brand) is a type of product that a company  makes. For example, Apple Computer makes an iPod. That’s one of its “brands.”  The “model” of a brand is the particular version or type of that piece of equ ipment so a video iPod or 5th generation iPod is one model in the iPod brand. The re are many other types of iPods. The clerk asked me if I have the “receipt” a nd, of course, which is what they give you when you buy something to show that y ou bought it. He asked if I want to “exchange it or return it” and I tell him I  want to return in. If I said I wanted

to “exchange it,” that means they would give me ano ther DVD player in place of the one that I am returning.

I give him my credit card and he says that he will “credit it back” to my credit card, meaning he will put the money back onto my cr edit. We can use the verb -- or the word “credit” as a verb. “To credit someone”  means to give them money or give them money back. The clerk then asked if there ’s “anything else he can help me with,” and that’s a common expression you hear i n the store at the end, after you’ve done everything that you plan on doing. The clerk may ask you, or the sales person, “Is there anything else I can help yo u with?” And I said, “Oh, there is one more thing,” meaning there’s something else.  “There’s one more thing.” I ask if they “carry” the iPod Nano. “To carry,”  for  a store, means that they have it in their store, they sell it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at nativ e rate of speech.

# Wait-Listed for a Flight

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 102: Wait-Listed for a Flight.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 102. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this podcast, we will be talking about taking an  airplane flight and being put on a wait-list. Let’s get started! > I can't believe I made it into San Francisco, at lo ng last! This morning, I went to the airport to catch my 10 a.m. flight. I got there  early to go through security. The folks at the TSA can really slow things down someti mes. Since I had an electronic ticket, I didn't have to wait at the tic ket counter to check in, but instead used a kiosk. I then went straight to the gate, but  when I got there, I couldn't believe my eyes. The flight was delayed -- for two hours!
> I decided to look at the flight monitors to see if there was an earlier flight to San Francisco. I thought maybe I could either switch to  that flight or get wait-listed. I saw that there was another flight leaving in 40 min utes and so I bolted for the gate. When I got there, I got into the back of the long line. When I got to the front of the line, I asked the gate agent if I could get on that flight instead and she said I would be wait-listed. She said that I needed to s tay in the gate area and wait for my name to be called if they have a seat available,  so I waited, and waited, and waited.
> The gate agent began calling out names over the PA system and guess what? The last name called was mine. What a relief! The l ast seat left on the plane was a middle seat and I usually prefer an aisle or wind ow, but I was just happy to get on board. I didn't want my vacation to get delayed because of a late flight.
> When the plane landed, I went out to the curb to ca tch a taxi to my hotel. I only had carry-on bags so I didn't need to wait in bagga ge claim. I was out of the airport and off on my vacation.

We’re traveling in today’s podcast. I began my stor y by saying that I couldn’t believe I made it to San Francisco “at long last.” The expression “at long last” means finally, after a long time. I said that this morning, I went to the airport to “catch” my 10:00 AM flight. “To catch a flight” mea ns to take an airplane ride, an airplane flight, but we usually say, “I’m going to catch a flight to Cleveland,” or, “I’m going to catch a flight to San Francisco.” Eit her “catch” or “take” is possible. I said I got there early to go through “security.” “S ecurity,” of course, is the guards that make sure you don’t have any bombs or anything  dangerous. In the United States, now, since 9-11, the airports all have a fe deral agency, A U.S government organization that checks for security. I t’s called the “Transportation Safety Administration,” the TSA, and people just ca ll it the “TSA.”

I said that since I had an “electronic ticket,” I d idn’t have to wait at the “ticket counter” to check in. An “electronic ticket” – most  tickets now are electronic. You sign up on the Internet and they send you an email and you don’t have a physical ticket. You just have sort of a receipt if you prin t out your email. If you have a problem with your ticket, you may have to go to the  “ticket counter” and the “ticket counter” is the desk in an airport where yo u buy tickets or you – sometimes, if you have a paper ticker, you “check i n” at the ticket counter. “To check in” means to tell them that you’re there to –  it’s kind of like registering and they give you what’s called a “boarding pass,” and a “boarding pass” is your slip – usually a piece of paper that allows you to get o n the airplane.  I didn’t have to do that. I used an electronic “kiosk,” and here a “ kiosk” (kiosk) is a machine that you can put your credit card in and it recognizes w ho you are and you get your boarding pass from the electronic “kiosk.”

I then went straight to the “gate,” and the “gate” (gate) – in an airport, a “gate” is where the plane pulls up to the building and where you get on the plane and off the plane. Getting on the plane is called “boarding ” the plane, and getting off the plane, we say, “deboarding.” So, I went to the gate  and usually, for example, at Los Angeles International Airport, there are severa l different “terminals” and each “terminal” has several “gates.” A “terminal” is lik e a wing or a section of an airport. So, I went to the “gate” but when I got th ere, I discovered that my flight was “delayed.” “To be delayed” (delayed) is a verb which means that it’s late, that my flight wasn’t going to leave on time, at the tim e it was scheduled, but two hours later. I then decided to look at the “flight monitors” to see if there was an earlier flight to San Francisco.” The “flight monit ors” are the TV screens or television screens in an airport that show you what  time the plane is either arriving, coming to the airport, or departing, leav ing the airport, and in most American airports, you’ll see one set of monitors f or arrivals and then, usually below it or on the other side, there’s a set of fli ght monitors for departures.

I was hoping that I could get “wait-listed.” The ve rb “wait-listed” (wait) (listed) – “to be wait-listed” means they put you on a list an d you have to wait to see if you can get on at a particular flight if there’s room. So, I “bolted” to the gate that was leaving, where the plane was leaving earlier. “To b olt” (bolt) – the past tense is “bolted” (bolted) – “to bolt means to go very quick ly, to run, usually to run very fast. Well, when I got to the other gate, I asked t he “gate agent” if I could get a flight – get on that flight – get a seat, that is, on that flight. The “gate agent” (agent) is the person from the airplane – the airli ne company – who works for the airline. The person who helps you at the gate is ca lled the “gate agent.” The person who works at the ticket counter is usually c alled the “ticket agent.” So, I was wait-listed for the flight and I was told I had  to stay in the “gate area” and wait for my name to be called. The “gate area,” of course, is the area – the part of the airport that is near that gate.

Well, the gate agent began calling out names, or “a nnouncing” names, and she announced them over the “PA” system. The “PA” stand s for the “public address” and that is the speakers that everyone can hear the  announcements from. I then said, “Guess what?” The expression, “Guess what?” i s something you say to someone when you’re going to tell them something su rprising or maybe something they don’t expect. “I went to the store a nd guess what? They didn’t have any milk.” Well, I had my name called and I go t the last seat on the plane. It was a “middle” seat. In most American planes – in m ost planes everywhere, there often are three seats on either side of a mid dle “aisle.” “Aisle” is spelled (aisle). That’s the walkway where you can walk back  and forth on the plane, and the seats that are right on the aisle are called the “aisle seats,” and the ones near the window are logically called the “window seats,”  and the other seat is called the “middle seat.” Sometimes, we don’t say “aisle s eat.” We just say, “aisle,” or “window,” so the gate agent might say, “Do you want  an aisle or a window?” They mean an aisle seat or a window seat.

I was happy to get on board, and we talked about the verb “to board” – means to get on an airplane, so if you are “on board,” you a re on the airplane. When I got to San Francisco, I got out of the plane. The plane  “landed” and, of course, “to land,” for a plane, means to arrive, to touch down on the ground. The opposite of “landing” is “taking off.” So, a plane “takes off” and it “lands.” When I got to the airport in San Francisco, I went to the “curb” to c atch a taxi. The “curb” is the edge of the street. That part of the street right a t the very end or edge on each side of the street is called “the curb.” So, I went  to the “curb” of the street outside the airport and I “caught a taxi.” “To catch a taxi ” means to ride in or to take a taxi cab. I only had “carry-on bags” so I didn’t need to  wait in “baggage claim.” There are two kinds of pieces of luggage – types of lugga ge, and these are called either “carry-on bags” or “check-in bags.” “Carry-on,” you  take with you on the airplane,

put it above you or in the seat in front of you, an d to “check-in” your bags, or “checked baggage,” means that you put them below the plane and then you have to get them back when you arrive at the airport by going to “baggage claim.” “Baggage claim” is where you pick up your luggage t hat you had checked.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at native r ate of speech.  > I can't believe I made it into San Francisco, at lo ng last! This morning, I went to the airport to catch my 10 a.m. flight. I got there  early to go through security. The folks at the TSA can really slow things down someti mes.

# Making a Sales Call

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 103: Making a Sales Call.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 103. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about making a telephone call for a sales person. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Last week, I was at a business luncheon and I met a  woman named Dana Okri who was heading a new start up. I have been a sales  rep for Eureka Corp. for three years now and our bread and butter is data ma nagement software. I told her briefly about our products over lunch and she h ad given me her card.

I decided to follow up with a call. I dialed her di rect line and fortunately, I got a hold of her on the first try.

Dana: Hello, Dana Okri.

Kevin: Hello, Dana, this is Kevin Abrahams from Eur eka Corp. I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Cham ber of Commerce luncheon.

Dana: Oh, yes. Hi. How are you?

Kevin: Great. Do you have a few minutes right now f or me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company ha s to offer? It won't take long.

Dana: Actually, I'm really swamped right now and I' ll be going into a meeting in a few minutes. Is there any literature you can send m e?

Kevin: Oh, sure, I understand. I'd be happy to send  you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a c ompany your size. Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any quest ions?

Dana: Let's do this. Since I'm not sure when I'll g et a chance to read the material, why don't I give you a call if I have any questions . Now, I'm really sorry, but I have to get going to this meeting.

Kevin: No problem at all. I won't keep you any long er. I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there.

Dana: Sounds good.

Kevin: Thanks for your time.

Dana: No problem. Bye-bye.

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with a man talking about how he wa s at a “business luncheon” and he met a woman named Dana who was “heading a ne w start up.” A “business luncheon” “luncheon” (luncheon) is a form al business lunch, usually with many people. The woman was named “Dana.” In ot her words, her name was “Dana,” and she was “heading a new start up.” “ To be heading something” means to be the boss, the person who is organizing and leading it. A “start up” – a “start up” is two words, it’s a noun which refers  to a new company. Particularly in the Internet world, we talk about “start ups,” m eaning new Internet companies, but it can also just mean any new company, a “start  up.”

The man says he’s a “sales rep” for Eureka Corp. A “sales rep” (rep) – “rep” stands here for “representative,” so when someone s ays they’re a “sales rep,” they mean they are “sales representative,” which is  just another name for a salesperson, someone who sells for a company. He me ntioned that the “bread and butter” of their company, his company, is data management software. The expression, “our bread and butter,”  means this is where we make most of our money. This is the most important part of our busin ess. So, a business can have many different branches or divisions or sections bu t usually, there’s one, what you might call “core” (core), or main principal, pr imary business and that’s where you make your most money. And that’s what the expre ssion here means “our bread and butter.” It means that’s what where we ea rn the money to – literally, to buy our bread and butter, is the original, I’m sure , connection.

“Data management software” is a computer program th at helps people organize information. The woman gives the sales rep her “car d,” meaning her business card, and the man decides to follow up their conver sation with a “call.” The verb, “follow up” or “to follow up,” is used when you tal k to someone or have a

conversation or an email and you agree to do someth ing or you have an appointment or something that you need to continue talking about. One of the people in the conversation may “follow up,” that is  I talk to you on Monday and you say you’re going to think about buying one of m y products. I call back on Friday to “follow up,” in other words, to check, to  see if you are still interested. And you can use this expression in lots of differen t places. Sometimes, for example, if you go to the doctor and the doctor say s, “Hmm, well, you’re okay now but I want you to come back in two weeks for a follow-up appointment.” Here it’s used as an adjective. “This is an appointment so that I can check you again.” So, that’s the meaning of follow up. “With a call,”  of course, means with a telephone call.

He says he dials her “direct line” and fortunately he got hold of her on the first try. “To dial” means, of course, to dial in a telephone.  To press the numbers means “to dial.” The “direct line” -- in a company that h as many different people working in it, often times, you have a general number where  you call, and you get a secretary or the operator, and you have to ask for somebody in the company that you want to speak with. The “direct line” would be the number directly to that person. You don’t have to go through the operator. The man says he fortunately, “got a hold of” the woman on the first try. “To get  a hold of” means to reach someone, to be able to – the other person answered the phone. “I got a hold of you,” or, “I’m trying to get a hold of you.” “I’m t rying to call you so that” – when you are there to pick up your phone. The man says t hat he got the woman on the “first try” or on the “first attempt.” The first ti me he tried, he was able to reach her.

The woman answers the phone and the man says, “Hell o Dana. This is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp. I don’t know if you’ll r emember me but we met last week at the luncheon,” at the Chamber of Commerce L uncheon. The expression, “I don’t know if you’ll remember me but,” is what y ou would use when you’re calling someone and you only met them once, maybe t wice. They may, in fact, not remember who you are so it’s kind of a polite w ay of saying, “Do you remember me?” “I don’t know if you’ll remember me b ut we talked on the telephone last week.” Now, here, they met at a “Cha mber of Commerce” luncheon – and the “Chamber of Commerce” is a priva te group of businesses that – it’s like an organization that businesses in  a specific area, usually, can belong to. So, Los Angeles has a Chamber of Commerc e and they have meetings and they do all sorts of things to help bu sinesses in a particular area. And most American cities have a Chamber of Commerce . “Commerce,” of course, is business and a “chamber” literally is a big room where everybody sits, but here it just means an organization, a business organization. The man asked Dana if she has a few minutes right now. “Do you ha ve a few minutes right now

for me to tell you a little bit more?” meaning, “Is  this a good time?” Do you have time right now to talk? Do you have a few minutes?”

The man, Kevin, says, “It won’t take long,” meaning  it won’t take up a lot of your time. I won’t talk to you very long. “It won’t take  long.” The woman says she’s really “swamped” right now. “To be swamped” means t o be very busy, to be extremely busy. “I’m swamped right now.” She asked the man if he has any “literature” he can send her, and, here, “literatur e” means information, printed information, a letter, a brochure, a catalogue that  he can send her. We also use “literature,” of course, to mean “books” and usuall y, good books, fiction books and so forth, but here it just means -- in a busine ss setting, when someone says, “Do you have any literature on it?” they mean, “Do you have anything printed, something you can give me that I can look at?”

Kevin says, “Sure.” He will send her a “promotional  packet.” A “packet” is just a collection of information, usually more than one th ing in a “packet” (packet). It’s kind of like a package, a packet is. “Promotional” – “to promote something” is like to try to give people information so that they will  buy it. The verb “to promote” means to advertise, to make known, to tell other pe ople. “We’d like to promote ESL Podcast.” We want other people to come and list en to us. The adjective is “promotional packet.” It’s a packet of information,  a set of pieces of information that are about that particular product. Kevin says he thinks he can send her information about what might “best suit” a company.  “To suit (suit) a company” means what would be appropriate from you, what woul d be correct or right for you. We use this verb in a lot of different ways. You can say, for example, about a piece of clothing – a shirt, or a pair of pants. “That doesn’t suit you,” meaning it’s not right for you. It’s not appropriate for yo u.

The man then asks, “Would it be okay if I called ag ain?” He’s asking permission. Is it okay? “Would it be okay if I call you again?”  And the woman says, “Let’s do this.” And when someone says, “Let’s do this,” they ’re proposing, they’re giving them another option, another possibility, and here,  it’s clear the woman wants to get off the telephone, so she tells the sales perso n what she wants to happen. She says, “Lets’ do this. Why don’t I give you call  if I have any questions.” That expression, “Why don’t I,” is when you are proposin g something to someone and you want them to agree to you – to your idea. “Why don’t you call me tomorrow” means could you please call me tomorrow. The woman then says she’s very busy and she has to “get going,” meaning she has to  leave, she has to go to her meeting. “I have to get going.” The man says, “Oh, I won’t keep you any longer.” When someone “keeps” you, that means that they are preventing you from going. You may hear someone say, “I don’t want to keep you ” – means I don’t want to delay you, to make you stay here. And so he says “I  don’t want to keep you any

longer.” He will mail the package or the packet in the mail and “we’ll go from there.” The expression, “we’ll go from there,” mean s I’ll send you the package. You look at it and then we’ll see what happens, so it’s a general expression to mean “We will continue on in this conversation or t his relationship,” whatever it is, after you receive, in this case, the package or som e other event happens.

The woman says, “Sounds good,” meaning, “Okay I agr ee.” “That sounds good” means that’s something I agree with. And the man, K evin, thanks her for her time and she says, “No problem.” And remember, when some body thanks you in English, it’s more common, informally, for people, instead of just say, “You’re welcome,” many people say, “Oh, no problem,” meanin g it did not cause me any problem. It’s okay.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at nativ e rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Last week, I was at a business luncheon and I met a  woman named Dana Okri who was heading a new start up. I have been a sales  rep for Eureka Corp. for three years now and our bread and butter is data ma nagement software. I told her briefly about our products over lunch and she h ad given me her card.

I decided to follow up with a call. I dialed her di rect line and fortunately, I got a hold of her on the first try.

Dana: Hello, Dana Okri.

Kevin: Hello, Dana, this is Kevin Abrahams from Eur eka Corp. I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Cham ber of Commerce luncheon.

Dana: Oh, yes. Hi. How are you?

Kevin: Great. Do you have a few minutes right now f or me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company ha s to offer? It won't take long.

Dana: Actually, I'm really swamped right now and I' ll be going into a meeting in a few minutes. Is there any literature you can send m e?

Kevin: Oh, sure, I understand. I'd be happy to send  you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a c ompany your size. Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any quest ions?

Dana: Let's do this. Since I'm not sure when I'll g et a chance to read the material, why don't I give you a call if I have any questions . Now, I'm really sorry, but I have to get going to this meeting.

Kevin: No problem at all. I won't keep you any long er. I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there.

Dana: Sounds good.

Kevin: Thanks for your time.

Dana: No problem. Bye, bye.

# Bar Hopping

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 104: Bar Hopping.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 104. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about going to bars and drinking . Bottoms up!

[start of story]

A bunch of my old college friends came into town for a few days and we went out last night, bar hopping until closing time. We star ted around 9 p.m. and were on our third bar when we closed it down. Some of us we re starving and the rest of us were peckish so we decided to get a late-night s nack. We didn't want fast food so we decided to try to find a 24-hour diner.

We passed on a chain restaurant and went instead to  a dive near downtown. The six of us went in and we sat at the counter. Since the place was dead, we had it to ourselves. One of my friends, Paul, got pretty r owdy and the waitress had to tell him to chill out. He was pretty hammered so we  had to keep an eye on him. He was a lightweight and didn't usually drink much,  but he was bummed out about a fight he had had with his girlfriend and de cided to get smashed. I felt sorry for the guy, especially since I knew that he would have a terrible hangover in the morning. I tried to get him to drink some co ffee, but he just wanted to stay buzzed.

After we left the diner, I dropped everybody off at  Paul’s, since I was the designated driver. They were all crashing at his pl ace. I made my way home and fell into bed. It was good to see my old friends bu t I'm definitely getting too old to party like we did in college. As the old saying goe s: The mind is willing, but the body is weak.

[end of dialogue]

Today we “go drinking.” “To go drinking” means to g o drinking alcoholic beverages like beer or wine or some other type of a lcohol. I began, instead of saying, “Let’s get started” before the story, I use d an expression we use when we are drinking, that is, “Bottoms up! “Bottoms up” me ans that you take the bottom of your glass and you have to drink everything in i t so that it is up – facing up. So

that’s an old expression, “Bottoms up!” when you’re  going to drink. It’s similar to “Cheers!” or other sorts of what we would call “toa sts,” and a “toast” is something you say to someone or about someone before you take  a drink, like “Cheers!” for example.

The story begins with me talking about how “a bunch  of my college – my old college friends,” meaning my friends from way back.  The expression, “a bunch” (bunch), just means “a group of” here. So, a group of my old friends “came into town,” meaning they don’t live here but they are vi siting, and they came into town for a few days and we went out last night, “bar hop ping.” “To go out” means, you probably know, to go to a restaurant or go to a bar  or a theater. We went “bar hopping.” And “bar hopping” – “hop” – (hopping) “ho pping” – “bar hopping” is to go from one bar to another bar, to another bar and you have a drink at one bar and then you go somewhere else and you have a drink  at a different bar, and maybe if you’re lucky, you’ll meet someone at one of these bars. But we went bar hopping until “closing time,” and “closing time” is  the time that the bar closes. So, in Los Angeles, I believe, closing time is 2:00 AM – 2 o’clock in the morning. In some cities in the United States, it’s 1 o’clock in  the morning. Closing times tend to be – usually, not past 2:00 AM. Most bars – ther e aren’t any, or very few 24 hour bars in the United States. Legally, the bars h ave to close at usually 1:00 or 2:00 AM.

Well, I say, “We started around 9:00 PM and we were  on our third bar when we closed it down.” To say “we were on our third bar” means that we had now gone to our third bar, and we “closed it down,” we staye d until closing time. Now, of course, there aren’t any bars open. So, I mentioned  that some of us were “starving” and the rest of us were “peckish.” “To b e starving” (starving) means to be very hungry and to be “peckish” means that you’r e a little hungry. That word, “peckish,” isn’t as common in English anymore that it means to be not very hungry, but a little hungry. Because we were hungry , we went to get a “late-night snack,” and a “snack” (snack) is a little something  to eat. “Late-night,” meaning it was very late in the night – actually, early in the  morning.

I said we didn’t want “fast food” so we tried to fi nd a “24-hour diner.” Well, “fast food,” two words, simply means restaurants like McD onald’s or Wendy’s or Burger King, any restaurant that serves food, usual ly, in a minute or two. They have it already prepared or if it’s a hamburger, th ey fix it very quickly. These types of restaurants are called “fast food” restaur ants. A “diner” (diner) is sort of an old-fashioned restaurant. Usually, in a diner, t here is a counter like a long table, and one side you can sit and on the other si de are the people who work there and they also, usually in a diner, have table s like a normal restaurant so you can sit at the counter or you can sit at a tabl e in a diner. And a diner sort of

has traditional food that you would find – usually serves breakfast and there are several “24-hour diners” in Los Angeles. These are diners or restaurants that are open 24 hours a day.

Well, I said that we “passed on” a chain restaurant  and went instead to a “dive” near downtown. “To pass on something” means to deci de not to do it or to go there, so it could be anything that you decide not to do. “My friend offered me two tickets to go to the University of Southern Califor nia football game and I passed on the tickets. I decided I didn’t want to go.” A “ chain restaurant” (chain) is a restaurant that is part of a larger group of restau rants. Again, McDonald’s is a fast food restaurant but it’s also a “chain” restau rant, and a “chain restaurant” would be any restaurant that is part – that there a re more than one of those, usually a part of a big company. We went to a “dive .” A “dive” (dive), as a noun, means a restaurant or a bar or some place that isn’ t very well maintained, maybe a little dirty, not the best environment to go to. A “dive” is a place that – it doesn’t have a lot of nice furniture and so forth. The verb  of course, “to dive” means, for example, you jump into the water, you can dive into  the water – doesn’t really have any connection here that I know of. When we us e it as a noun, in this case to mean a place, it means a not very nice place.

So, the six of us went in to this diner and we sat at the “counter,” and I mentioned before that the “counter” is that place where every one can sit next to each other and they’re all facing the same direction and there  are people working on the other side of the counter. I said the place was “de ad” and we had it to ourselves. When you describe a place as being “dead,” you mean  there’s no one there, there are very few people there. “I went to the mal l the day before Christmas and it was dead.” Well, no, that would never happen. Of  course, it’s – instead the opposite of “dead” would be, in this case, not “ali ve” but “packed,” so if you say the store was “packed” (packed), you mean it was “f ull,” and the opposite would be it was “dead.” There was no one there. To say “w e had it ourselves” means we were the only ones there.

One of my friends, Paul, got pretty “rowdy” (rowdy) . “To be rowdy” means to be loud, to be bothering other people, and we sometime s use that word to describe, for example, crowds or people at a sporting event, say a soccer game. “The crowd got rowdy” means that they got loud and noisy  and were causing problems. The waitress told my friend to “chill out ” and “chill out,” two words (chill) out, you probably know, means to calm down,  to relax. My friend was pretty “hammered” and so we had to keep an eye on h im. When we say someone is “hammered” – “hammered” (hammered) is on e of the many words in English to mean that they were drunk, that they had  drunk too much alcohol. The technical word would be they were “intoxicated.” “I ntoxicated” means you’re

drunk, in this case. And in every language, there a re many words to describe someone who has had too much alcohol and English is  no different. “Hammered” is one word you can use. There are many others. “Sm ashed” (smashed), I use in the story “to get smashed” or “to be smashed.”  “To  get smashed” means to get drunk. “To be smashed” means to be drunk.

I said we had to “keep any eye on” my friend. That means we had to watch him, we had to make sure he was okay. This is a general expression to mean to watch over something. So, if you are at a café and you have your laptop there, and you say to the person in the next table, “Could  you keep an eye on my laptop while I go to the restroom?” You’re asking them to watch it, and, of course, you come back from the restaurant and they’re gone and so is your laptop so don’t do that. The friend of mine I was talking about, I des cribed him as a “lightweight.” A “lightweight” here means someone who can’t drink ve ry much alcohol before they get sick or before they get drunk. The opposite of the “lightweight is not a “heavyweight.” You might think so. I don’t know if there’s a good opposite of “lightweight,” but a “lightweight” when it comes to  drinking is someone who can’t drink very much without passing out, without going unconscious or getting very drunk.

My friend decided to get “smashed,” to get drunk, b ecause he had a fight with his girlfriend – sounds like an old story, a familiar s tory. And he was “bummed out.” “To be bummed (bummed) out” means to be sad, to be very depressed, to be disappointed. That is to be “bummed out,” and somet imes people will just say, “I’m bummed,” and that’s an informal expression aga in, to mean I’m sad. In England, in Britain, they use the word “bum” (bum) to mean what we would call in the United States your “butt” or your rear, what yo u sit on. I was worried my friend would have a terrible “hangover” the next mo rning because he drank so much. A “hangover,” all one word (hangover), is if you feel badly or feel sick after you’ve drank too much. Often the next morning, you wake up with a headache and you may have a stomach ache. That’s called a “h angover.” It comes from drinking too much alcohol. Of course, none of our l isteners of ESL Podcast would ever do that.

The friend of mine, I said, didn’t want to drink an y coffee, and of course, traditionally, coffee is supposed to help you get o ver begin drunk. I don’t know if it does or not. But my friend said he just wanted to s tay “buzzed,” and “buzzed” (buzzed) is just like “smashed” and “hammered.” It means intoxicated, drunk. I said that after we left the diner, I dropped everyo ne off at my friend Paul’s since I was the “designated driver.” The expression, “desig nated driver,” two words, is a noun that refers to the person who decides they’re not going to drink or drink very much so that they can drive everyone else from bar to bar and then to go home.

Places like Los Angeles, there aren’t very many pos sibilities for public transportation and a taxi would be very expensive s o sometimes friends will say, “Well, you don’t drink tonight,” or, “Don’t drink v ery much so you can drive,” and this term, “designated driver,” has been around for  about maybe 20 years. When I was in college, this was something that people we re talking about.

My friends decided they were all going to “crash at  Paul’s place.” “Crashing” or “to crash” means, here, to sleep, usually temporari ly, for one night or a couple of nights. Someone who is visiting you from another st ate or city might say, “Can I crash at your place for a couple of days” – means can I stay at your house or apartment for a few days while I’m visiting. I said  that it was good to see my old friends but that I was getting “too old to party li ke we did in college.” The verb here, “to party,” means, of course, to go out, have  a good time, maybe drink. I end the story with an old saying, “The mind is will ing, but the body is weak.” This means the mind, your brain or what you want to do –  you’re willing to do something, you want to do something but your body i sn’t strong enough. Your body is weak. And when you get old, you will know w hat I mean.

Now let’s listen to the story at native rate of spe ech.

[start of story]

A bunch of my old college friends came into town for a few days and we went out last night bar hopping until closing time. We start ed around 9 p.m. and were on our third bar when we closed it down. Some of us we re starving and the rest of us were peckish so we decided to get a late-night s nack. We didn't want fast food so we decided to try to find a 24-hour diner.

After we left the diner, I dropped everybody off at  Paul’s, since I was the designated driver. They were all crashing at his pl ace. I made my way home and fell into bed. It was good to see my old friends, b ut I'm definitely getting too old to

party like we did in college. As the old saying goe s, “The mind is willing, but the body is weak.”

That’s all we have time for today. From Los Angeles , California, I’m Jeff McQuillan. We’ll see you next time on ESL Podcast.

# Driving Directions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 105: Driving Directions.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 105. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is going to be about giving someone  directions or instructions about how to drive to a certain place. Let’s get st arted!  > I was getting into my car at the mall when I notice d a man standing nearby with a map. He looked confused and I asked him if I could help. He looked up and was clearly relieved. He was from Houston, Texas, he told me, and he was visiting his daughter. She was at work that afternoon and he wan ted to take the opportunity to buy her a present before she got back, but he wa sn't accustomed to driving in L.A. and he got all turned around. His daughter liv ed near the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and he needed to find his way back.
> I was familiar with that area so I gave him some di rections:
> "When you drive out of the mall, turn left and get into the far right lane. You need to get on the 10 freeway and the on-ramp will be on  your right. Go about two blocks and you will see a sign that says 10W right after you cross under the bridge. Once you are on the freeway, look out for t he exit for La Brea Avenue. Get off at that off-ramp and you will be heading no rth on La Brea. Go straight up La Brea, past Venice Boulevard, and keep your eyes out for Wilshire Boulevard. If you get to Beverly Boulevard, you've gone too fa r. A good landmark to look for is the big Samsung sign on the corner, at the inter section of La Brea and Wilshire, atop an office building. Make a left on W ilshire, going west. Go about six blocks and you'll see the museum on the right-h and side."
> The man said that he knew his way from the museum a nd thanked me for the directions.
> I was glad I could help. I don't envy anyone who ha s to drive the freeways in L.A. It's not for the faint of heart!
> Today we’re giving driving directions to someone wh o is lost, driving here in Los Angeles, and I talk a lot about driving here in Los  Angeles because everyone has a car and everyone drives. There is not very good p ublic transportation in this city. Other cities like New York or Chicago, even S an Francisco have better public transportation than Los Angeles but here in Los Angeles, we spend a lot of time in our cars.

I started the story by saying that I was “getting i nto my car” at the mall. “To get into your car” means to enter your car, to open the  door and sit down and close the door. I said I was getting into my car at the m all or the shopping center and I noticed a man standing nearby with a map. “To be st anding nearby” means to be standing close to you, in the area that is close to  you. If we use the word “nearby,” we mean it’s in the area around us. If we  use the word “near” then we usually have to say what it is near to, so, for exa mple, “The man was standing near the door.” You would not say, “The man is stan ding near.” You have to say “near” where. You have to say where he is or she is  near to but if you say “nearby” then you don’t need to do that. It just me ans “in the general area.”

The man looked confused and I asked if I could help . “He looked up,” meaning he raised his head and looked at me. He looked up a nd was “clearly relieved.” “To be relieved” means that you feel calm because s omeone has solved a problem for you, or feeling anxious or stressed and  now you feel relaxed. The man then was relieved – he was “clearly relieved” ( clearly), which is an adverb here that means he was obviously relieved. I could tell immediately. That word – that adverb, “clearly,” we use a lot to mean very o bviously, you can tell right away. You could say, “The woman was clearly a model  because she was beautiful.” A “model,” of course, is someone who is  very beautiful and wears clothes that companies are trying to sell. Anyway, there were no models in the story.

The man was lost and he said he was from Texas, Hou ston, Texas, which is of course one of the many large cities in Texas – the state of Texas. He was visiting his daughter and he wanted to take the opportunity to buy her a present before she got back. “To take the opportunity” means to ta ke advantage of the time or the situation. “Let me take this opportunity to tha nk you for being there” means let me take advantage of the fact that I am talking to you now, to thank you. Here, the man took the opportunity to “buy a present,” me aning he had some time and now he was able to take advantage of it. The woman – or the man was going to buy a present or a gift for his daughter “before sh e got back,” meaning before she returned back to her house.

 The man wasn’t “accustomed” to driving in L.A. “To be accustomed to” means to be used to, to be familiar with. And because of tha t he got all “turned around.” “To be turned around” means to be lost. You’re driv ing, you take a right on one street, you take a left on another street and you g et “all turned around,” you get lost. He needed to “find his way back.” “To find hi s way back” means to find out how to return to the place where he left. I gave hi m some driving directions. I told him, “When you drive out of the mall, turn left and  get into the far right lane.” “To drive out of,” here means to leave, to exit. “When you drive out of the mall, turn left and “get into the far right lane.” A “lane” is  a part of a road. Usually, if it’s a regular street, there are two lanes, one for each d irection. In a freeway – on a freeway, particularly in Los Angeles, you usually h ave two, three, sometimes five or six lanes. Here in L.A, many of the freeways hav e four, five, six different lanes going in each direction. Well, I advised or told the man to “get into” -- and that’s the verb we would use, “get into the lane” – means go over to that lane, and this was the “far right lane,” meaning the lane that was  farthest to the right. The opposite, of course, would be the “far left lane.” In the United States, the “far right” – I’m sorry, the “far left lane” is usually the lane where if you want to drive faster. If you want to pass or go in front of anoth er car, you get into the “far left lane,” and if you get into the “far left lane” and you don’t drive fast, you will have many angry drivers behind you.

I told the man to “get on the 10 freeway and the on -ramp will be on your right.” As you probably know, in the United States, we have a national freeway system and these freeways all have numbers. The freeways that go east to west are even numbers and those that go north to south are odd nu mbers, so Highway 5 goes north to south and Highway 10 goes east to west. Hi ghway 10 is the major, important highway – freeway that goes from the Paci fic Ocean in Santa Monica all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, so it cuts acros s the entire country and it begins here in Los Angeles. The “on-ramp” (on ramp) is whe re you get on a freeway. A “ramp” is usually something that goes up or goes do wn. Freeways are usually above or below the level of the rest of the area ar ound them, in a city in particular, so you either go on a – you get on an o n-ramp, you’re either going to go up or you’re going to go down. In order to find the on-ramp, I tell the man to go two blocks and he will see “a sign that says 10W  right after you cross under the bridge.” “To go two blocks” means, of course, t o drive two blocks, a “block” being the distance between two streets. I said, “Go  two blocks and you will see a sign that says 10W,” and “W” here stands for 10 “We st.” “Right after you cross under the bridge,” meaning as soon as you cross und er or go underneath the bridge, you will see the sign. That expression, “ri ght after,” means immediately after something.

After he gets on the freeway, I tell the man to loo k for the “exit” for La Brea Avenue. The “exit” (exit) is where you leave the fr eeway, so he looks for the exit for this street or avenue called “La Brea,” a big a venue here in Los Angeles. I tell the man to “get off at the off-ramp” and he will be  “heading north on La Brea.” The expression, “to get off in a freeway,” means to  leave, to exit. You normally “get off at an exit” and the “off-ramp” (off ramp) is the ramp that takes you off the freeway and onto the city street, what we would pro bably call here in Los Angeles, a “surface street.” “Surface streets” are everything but the freeway. The man is told to “head north.” “To head north” means to go north, to go in the direction of north. I tell him to go straight up La  Brea, past Venice Boulevard. “To go straight” means you don’t turn, you don’t go lef t, you don’t go right. We often use the expression “ to go up a street” or “to go d own a street.” Sometimes when we say “go up,” we mean north, or “go down,” we mea n south, but people use those expressions often without referring to a part icular direction, north, south, east or west. I could’ve said, “Go down La Brea,” a nd that would’ve been understood to mean the same as, “Go up La Brea,” bu t occasionally you want to distinguish and people will use “go up” to mean go north.

I said to go “past” Venice Boulevard.” “To go past”  (past) means that you’re going to drive beyond it. You’re going to drive past it. You’re not going to stop there. I tell him to “keep your eye out” for Wilshire Boulev ard. “To keep your eye out” means to be watching carefully for. We usually use that expression when something is going to happen very soon, and in this  case, I tell him to “keep his eye out” for this particular street or boulevard. W ilshire Boulevard again, a major, important street in Los Angeles, goes east, west.

I tell him if he gets to Beverly Boulevard, “You’ve  gone too far,” meaning you’ve driven too far, you have to turn around and go back , return to where you were. A “good landmark,” I said, is a sign at the corner, t he intersection of La Brea and Wilshire. A “landmark” (landmark), all one word, is  a sign or a building or something that helps you find a place, something th at is very noticeable, that you can see very easily, so, for example, a landmark co uld be a building. It could be a sign. It could be anything that helps you find wh ere you are. “You know you have arrived at Wilshire Boulevard if you see the b ank.” Well, the bank is a “landmark.” It tells you -- it helps you figure out  where you are. That’s how we’re using it here. I tell him to look for the big “Sams ung” sign, and “Samsung” is a name of a Korean electronics manufacturer – company , at the intersection. “The intersection,” all one word (intersection), is wher e two streets cross, a north-south crosses an east-west. That’s an intersection.

The “intersection” – the sign at the intersection i s - I say, is “atop an office building” (atop) – means it’s on top off – just ano ther way to say on top of, “atop.”

I tell him to “make a left,” that is to say, “to tu rn left.” You can say “make a left.” You can say, “Go left.” You can say “Turn left.” Th ey all mean the same. And you should “go about six blocks,”  in other words, driv e about six blocks, and “you’ll see the museum on the right-hand side.” The “right- hand side,” of course, is the side to his right. We could’ve just said, “You’ll s ee the museum on your right,” and here we say – it means the same as “You’ll see the museum on the right- hand side.” The man said he knew his way from the m useum and thanked me. To say “you know your way” means you know how to ge t there. You don’t need more directions.

I ended the story by saying, “I don’t envy the man. ” “To envy someone” means to want what they have. I say, “I don’t envy him” beca use driving in L.A is “not for the faint of heart.” “The faint (faint) of heart (h eart)” means for those who don’t have courage, for those who are weak. If you are “f aint of heart,” you are not very strong, you don’t have a lot of courage.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at native r ate of speech.

[start of story]

I was getting into my car at the mall when I notice d a man standing nearby with a map. He looked confused and I asked him if I could help. He looked up and was clearly relieved. He was from Houston, Texas, he told me, and he was visiting his daughter. She was at work that afternoon and he wan ted to take the opportunity to buy her a present before she got back. But, he w asn't accustomed to driving in L.A. and he got all turned around. His daughter liv ed near the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and he needed to find his way back.

I was familiar with that area so I gave him some di rections:

"When you drive out of the mall, turn left and get into the far right lane. You need to get on the 10 freeway and the on-ramp will be on  your right. Go about two blocks and you will see a sign that says 10W right after you cross under the bridge. Once you are on the freeway, look out for t he exit for La Brea Avenue. Get off at that off-ramp and you will be heading no rth on La Brea. Go straight up La Brea, past Venice Boulevard, and keep your eyes out for Wilshire Boulevard. If you get to Beverly Boulevard, you've gone too fa r. A good landmark to look for is the big Samsung sign on the corner, at the inter section of La Brea and Wilshire atop an office building. Make a left on Wilshire, g oing west. Go about six blocks and you'll see the museum on the right-hand side."

The man said that he knew his way from the museum a nd thanked me for the directions.

I was glad I could help. I don't envy anyone who ha s to drive the freeways in L.A. It's not for the faint of heart!

# High School Jobs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 106: High School Jobs.

English as a Second Language Podcast number 106. I’ m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educat ional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about having a job in high schoo l. Let’s get started! > I got my first part-time job when I was 15, working  at a car wash in the summertime. A friend of mine, Rob, worked there and  got me the job. I think it paid $2.90 an hour, which I considered a fortune. T here were no allowances in my family, so most of my brothers and sisters start ed working as soon as they could to get spending money. I hated working at the  car wash, drying cars all day. After only about six weeks working there (thou gh it seemed much longer), I up and quit one day. I felt badly about not giving a two-week notice, but I had it up to here with the job. Luckily, another friend of  mine got me a job working at a nursing home, washing dishes in the kitchen. I star ted the day after my 16th birthday, qualifying me for a slightly higher minim um wage.
> Life scrubbing pots and pans was no picnic, let me tell you. I lasted there for only three months, working after school and on weekends while trying to keep up with my homework in high school. My next job was much be tter: Making keys at a locksmith. The working conditions were much better and I had flexible hours around my school schedule. I stayed at that job for  nearly seven years, right through my college years at the University of Minne sota. To this day I still know the names of all the common key blanks, but it does n't come in handy very often!

We’re talking about having a job, a part-time job i n high school, in this podcast. I should explain that in the United States, it’s very  common for many students to work in high school when they are still studying for their high school diploma. This is especially true among middle class and work ing class – those students who come from families with less money. It is very common to have people work after school and on the weekends and this is someth ing which can cause a problem. Sometimes you have students who are workin g fifteen, maybe twenty

hours a week and going to high school during the da y. But as I say, it is quite common and getting jobs during the summertime or du ring the school year is a fact of life. It’s a common occurrence in many, man y families, as it was in mine. I got my first “part-time job,” and a “part-time job, ” in the United States, would be anything less than forty hours a week. I had a part -time job when I was fifteen, working at a car wash. Now, I should say that norma lly, it’s not legal to work in most jobs until you are 16 in the United States. Ho wever, there are some exceptions to that rule and it is sometimes possibl e to get a job at a lower salary, at a lower “wage,” and a “wage” (wage) is how much you get paid – at a lower wage, if you are fifteen. And when I was fifteen, I  got a job at a “car wash.” A “car wash,” two words, is, of course, where you wash you r car. In this case, it was an automatic car wash so it was washed by a machine an d then it was “dried,” that is, you take a towel and you take the towel – put t he towel on the car to take the water off. It was dried by hand. Sometimes, these a re called “hand car wash” – “hand car washes,” rather, because the drying is do ne by hand.

I got this job in the “summertime,” all one word – “summertime,” “wintertime,” those two words are, of course -- mean the same as summer and winter. You can’t say, “fall time” or “autumn time” but you can  say, “springtime.”  I don’t know why but you can say “spring time,” “summertime,” “w intertime,” but not autumn or “fall time;” you just say “autumn,” or “fall.” Anyw ay, I got this job and it paid, I believe, $2.90 and I thought that was a “fortune.” A “fortune” (fortune) is a lot of money. And there is a magazine in the United States , a business magazine called “Fortune,” and every year, this company – th is magazine publishes a list of the 500 biggest companies in the United States. Thi s is called the “Fortune 500,” and if you are a Fortune 500 company, like Apple or  Microsoft, McDonald’s, then you’re a very big company. The center for Education al Development, for example, is not a Fortune 500 company.

In my family, there were no “allowances.” An “allow ance” (allowance) is money that parents give their children so they can spend it however they want to. So, in some families, each week or each month, the parents  give the child, I don’t know, 15, 20, $30 in order to spend on buying candy or go ing to a movie or whatever the child wants to do. In my family, because I come  from a family of eleven children, there were no allowances. We were lucky j ust to get food. No, I’m kidding, but there were no allowances and so, if yo u wanted to have “spending money” -- and “spending money” means, of course, mo ney that you can spend that isn’t essential. If you wanted spending money,  you had to get a job as soon as you were old enough. Even before, of course, we would work at other informal jobs like, cutting the grass of our neighbors, so w e would “mow their lawn,” that is, cut the grass. We would, in Minnesota, shovel s now and get paid for shoveling the snow off the sidewalk of our neighbors.

 The car washes, I say, was not a very happy place t o work, not a very pleasant place, so after about six weeks, I “up and quit.” T he expression, “I up and,” means I suddenly decided to do something. Usually, it has to do leaving a place. “I up and quit,” or “I up and left.” It’s just an i diomatic, strange expression. Don’t try to analyze it grammatically but it’s common – “ I up and quit” as an informal – means I quit suddenly. I didn’t even give a “two we ek notice.” Again, a common custom, at least in the United States, is that when  you leave or quit your job, you give your employer “two weeks’ notice,” meaning I t ell you two weeks before I plan on leaving. I said, “I had it up to here” with  the job. The expression, “to have it up to here,” means I was tired of the job, I cou ld no longer tolerate, I could no longer put up with the job. So, you can say, “I’ve had it up to here with the bad weather” – means I can’t take it anymore. I can’t t olerate it anymore. Luckily another friend of mine got me a job at a “nursing h ome.” A “nursing home” is where usually older people who cannot take care of themselves go, and it’s usually – there are forty, fifty maybe a couple of hundred people. It’s not a hospital. It’s a place where they live, but it has medical care. I said that because I had started after my 16th birthday, “I qualified for a higher minimum wage.” “To qualify” means that you are able to do something. You have the “qualifications.” you have certain something that allows you to do so mething. For example, we use the term, “to qualify,” often for a sports even t or in the Olympics. For example, a certain number of people qualify to be o n the Olympic team and you compete against other players, and you “qualify” if  you have what it takes to be on the team, and you can go to Torino for the winte r Olympics this year – next year. The “minimum wage” is the lowest amount that a company can legally pay you. In the United States, a company normally has t o pay you a minimum amount. They can’t just pay you a dollar or $2. It has to pay you a legal amount and each – the federal government – rather, the nat ional government has a “minimum wage.” I think it’s $6.50 or $6.75 an hour .

I said that “life scrubbing pots and pans was no pi cnic, let me tell you.” “To scrub” means to rub very hard in order to clean. “Pots and  Pans” are what you cook in, so you put soup or whatever you’re cooking and you put it on a stove. You turn on the fire – those are called “pots and pans,” the  actual things that you cook with. I said it was – “life was no picnic.” That ex pression, “it was no picnic,” means it wasn’t easy. It wasn’t fun. A “picnic” (pi cnic) is when you go to a park or somewhere, to the beach and you have a little meal and you relax. “Well, this was no picnic, let me tell you.” That is a very com mon expression. “Let me tell you, it wasn’t easy,” meaning you should listen to me. I know what I am talking about. “Let me tell you.”

“I lasted only three months there,” meaning I staye d only three months, because I was having problems “keeping up” with my homework. “To keep up with” means to be able to do it – to do my homework on time. the “working conditions” of my next job were much better. My next job was at a “lo cksmith.” A “locksmith” (locksmith), all one word, is a place where you mak e keys, car keys, house keys, and so forth. “Working conditions” is a term we use  to mean how comfortable, how nice of a place it was. It can include whether it’s a safe place, a clean place. All that is part of the “working conditions.” “I st ayed at that job for seven years and “to this day, I still know the names of all the  common key blanks.” The expression “to this day” means from then right up u ntil now or still. Okay? I still know even after all these years, “to this day.” A “ blank” – a “key blank” is a key before it is cut, so it has the shape but it doesn’ t have the cuts in it. I said that this doesn’t – this knowledge doesn’t c ome in handy very often. “To come in handy” – and “handy” is (handy) – “to come in handy” means to be useful.

Now let’s take a listen to the story this time at a  native rate of speech.

# Going to the Dentist

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 107: Going to the Dentist.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 19. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On today’s podcast, we’re going to go to the dentis t. Let’s go!

[start of dialogue]

I went to the dentist to get a check-up and cleanin g. I showed up at the dentist's office a few minutes before 10. I gave the receptio nist my name and told her that I had a 10 a.m. appointment. She said that the doct or was running a little late and that I should take a seat. After about 15 minutes, a dental assistant came out and told me to follow her. She led me to a room and tol d me to take a seat in the exam chair, and then she put a dental bib on me.

The dentist came into the room.

Dentist: Hello, how are you today? Here for your si x month check-up?

Gary: I'm fine, Dr. Meecham. Yes, just a cleaning a nd check-up today.

Dentist: Oh, fine. Let's take a look.

She probed my teeth and checked my gums.

Dentist: Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose. We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the c rown needs to be refitted. Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them.

Gary: Okay, I'll do that, but my crown was just put  on last year. Will my dental insurance cover the work?

Dentist: Since you had that done here, we'll take c are of it. There won't be a charge. And your insurance should cover the work on  the cavity. Now, I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see  you soon for the other work.

Gary: Thanks, doctor.

The hygienist came into the room and had me rinse w ith mouthwash. She began her cleaning and finished by polishing my teeth. On  my way out, I tried to make an appointment for the following week. Unfortunatel y, there were no appointments available for two weeks, and the time they had was an inconvenient one, but I said I'd manage. I have to say, going to the dentist can be a pain, in the mouth and in the butt.

[end of story]

Today we are at the dentist and we are going to the  dentist for a check-up and a cleaning. A “check-up” (check-up) is when you go to  the dentist or the doctor and there’s nothing wrong with you but you want the doc tor or here, the dentist, to look at you, to look at your teeth and to see if th ey are okay. You can also go to the doctor for a check-up where he checks your heal th. A “cleaning” is when they clean your teeth at the dentist.

I said “I showed up at the doctor’s office a few mi nutes before 10.” “To show up” means, of course, to arrive at a place. The doctor,  apparently, was “running a little late.” “To be running a little late” or “to be running late” means that they’re not on schedule. So, you have an appointment at 10 o’clock but the dentist can’t see you until 10:30 – they’re running a half hour l ate, we would say.

A dental assistant, who is someone who helps the de ntist, came and put me in one of the exam chairs – that’s the chair you sit i n at a dentist office – the “exam” or “examination chair” – and she put a dental “bib”  on me. A “bib” (bib) is what they put on you on your neck so that it covers the front of your clothing so that your clothing doesn’t get dirty. We use the same wo rd for a little baby who has a “bib” around their neck so when they’re eating, the y don’t spill food on their clothes or let food fall onto their clothes.

The dentist comes in and asked me if I’m here for a  check-up. I say, “I am.” So, she “probed” my teeth and checked my gums. “To prob e my teeth” means to take the little metal instrument that the dentist has an d they check your teeth to make sure you don’t have any “cavities.” A “cavity” (cav ity) is a hole in your tooth. Well, she probed my teeth and she checked my “gums.” My “ gums” (gums) – plural – my gums are the part of your mouth that’s below the  teeth, the red part. It’s where the skin is. The teeth are in the gums – the bottom of the teeth are in the gums.

The dentist said that I had a cavity, a hole, in on e of my teeth and that my “crown” was loose. My “crown” (crown) – when a dent ist talks about a crown, he or she means it’s like a cap that’s – something tha t’s put on top of a tooth that is falling apart, that isn’t healthy. And so, they put  a crown on. It looks just like a tooth. It’s like a little jacket for your tooth. An d the word “crown” is also used for what you put on. A king would put on his head, or a  queen would put on her head – that’s a crown – that round thing with diamonds o r whatever. Well, this is a crown for your teeth. Often, crowns are made of gol d. At least they used to be made of gold – probably too expensive now.

The dentist said that she needed to “fill” my cavit y. “To fill a cavity” or “to put in a filling” means that they take a little drill and th ey clean out the hole and then they put in something to fill the hole, so the tooth doe sn’t have more damage done to it – that the hole doesn’t get bigger. And we call that a filling – and the verb “to fill” – just like you would “fill” a glass with wat er, pour water into it and fill it. So, we use the same verb for what you put in your teeth  and the noun is “filling.”

My “crown” needed to be “refitted.” “To fit” someth ing means to put it on and make sure that it’s the right size. “To refit it” m eans they have to take it off and adjust it and then put it back on again.

I asked my dentist if my insurance, my dental insur ance, would cover the work. “Dental insurance,” of course, is insurance that yo u buy or that your company buys, that you work for, and it pays for a certain amount of your dental work. Some dental insurance plans cover half of the cost and some cover 80% of the cost. It depends on how much insurance you buy. Mos t companies, for full time employees in the United States, will have some heal th insurance – private health insurance and some dental insurance. Of course, med ical care in the United States is mostly private, and there is very little public assistance – public help for health problems.

The dentist said that there wouldn’t be a charge for the crown. A “charge,” meaning she wouldn’t – I wouldn’t have to pay money . A “charge” is like a bill. The verb “to charge me,” for example, would mean to  bill me, to give me a bill.

After the dentist left, the hygienist came in to do  my cleaning. A “hygienist” (hygienist) is someone – is responsible for cleanin g your teeth. “Hygiene” is another word that we sometimes use for the idea of something being clean, of cleanliness. So, a “hygienist” makes sure your teet h are clean. To do that, she had me “rinse” with mouthwash. “To rinse” is to tak e something like water, in this case, “mouthwash” – all one word – and not to drink  it but to put in your mouth and then move it back and forth. The “mouthwash,” w hich is usually a green or

blue, helps clean your mouth and your teeth. The hy gienist then “polished” my teeth. “To polish” (polish) is a verb which means t o – usually to put some sort of chemical on it to make it even cleaner, to remove a ny dirt or stains. For example, if you drink a lot of coffee or tea, your teeth can  get brown. So, the hygienist will clean it and then polish it. So, it’s another type of cleaning.

Well, unfortunately, I had to return to the dentist  and they didn’t have any appointments for the following week. I told them th at I would take an appointment “two weeks from now.” Even though it was inconvenie nt, I said, “I’d manage.” When you say, “I’ll manage” or “I’d manage,” “to ma nage” here means I’ll be able to take care of it. I would be able to; it won’t ca use me any great problems. I’ll manage, I can take care of the situation. I said, “ I have to say, going to the dentist can be a pain.” “I have to say” is an expre ssion we use when you’re going to say something very honest. It’s sort of like to tell the truth. “I have to say, I’m not very happy with my government” or “I have to sa y, I’m very happy that the holidays are coming up.”

The dentist, I said, “can be a pain in the mouth, a nd in the butt.” Well, to be a “pain” as a noun – a “pain” – means that it’s a pro blem. It causes me problems. “It’s a pain in the mouth;” literally, it can cause  pain in your mouth. “To be a pain in the butt” means to be very inconvenient and that ’s an informal slang expression. Your “butt,” I think you probably know,  is that thing you sit on.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

I went to the dentist to get a check-up and cleanin g. I showed up at the dentist's office a few minutes before 10. I gave the receptio nist my name and told her that I had a 10 a.m. appointment. She said that the doct or was running a little late and that I should take a seat. After about 15 minutes, a dental assistant came out and told me to follow her. She led me to a room and tol d me to take a seat in the exam chair, and then she put a dental bib on me.

The dentist came into the room.

Dentist: Hello, how are you today? Here for your si x month check-up?

Gary: I'm fine, Dr. Meecham. Yes, just a cleaning a nd check-up today.

Dentist: Oh, fine. Let's take a look.

She probed my teeth and checked my gums.

Dentist: Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose. We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the c rown needs to be refitted. Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them.

Gary: Okay, I'll do that, but my crown was just put  on last year. Will my dental insurance cover the work?

Dentist: Since you had that done here, we'll take c are of it. There won't be a charge. And your insurance should cover the work on  the cavity. Now, I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see  you soon for the other work.

Gary: Thanks, doctor.

The hygienist came into the room and had me rinse w ith mouthwash. She began her cleaning and finished by polishing my teeth. On  my way out, I tried to make an appointment for the following week. Unfortunatel y, there were no appointments available for two weeks, and the time they had was an inconvenient one, but I said I'd manage.

# Asking Someone Out

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 108: Asking Someone Out.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 108. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about asking someone out on a da te, someone you’re romantically interested in. Let’s go!

[start of story]

I walked into the coffee room and saw that Brad was  writing something on a piece of paper. When he saw me come in, he slipped the note out of sight.

Trisha: Hey, what's up?

Brad: Oh, nothing.

Trisha: What were you writing?

Brad: (Laugh) All right. You caught me in the act. I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out. I was just writing a note to put on her desk.

Trisha: You mean you're going to ask her out in a n ote? You big chicken!

Brad: I admit it. I'm a wuss. I just can't do it in  person.

Trisha: But, you work with her every day.

Brad: That's different. When I'm working, I'm in a different frame of mind. But, when I even think about asking her out, I get tongu e-tied. At least in a note, I can get the words out without turning beet red.

Trisha: You've dated a lot. What's so different abo ut Diana?

Brad: Well, for one thing, she's gorgeous. She's so  upbeat and sweet. Who doesn't like her? Oh, I don't know. All I do know i s that I think we have great

chemistry together. But, what if I'm wrong? Maybe s he's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way. Oh fo rget it. This was a bad idea.

Trisha: Well, I guess you don't want this note, the n.

Brad: What note?

Trisha: I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana. She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorro w night.

Brad: You're kidding! I can't believe you've been s tanding there this entire time and didn't say anything.

Trisha: Sorry. What can I say? Now, do you want the  note or what?

Brad: Yeah, I want the note.

Trisha: Have a great time tomorrow night.

Brad: Thanks. I plan on it.

[end of the story]

Our story today is about a man who wants to ask out  someone or ask someone out. “To ask someone out” means to go on a date, a romantic date, with someone, to spend the evening going to a movie or d inner and so forth.

Well, in this story, the woman comes in and sees th at Brad is writing something on a piece of paper. But when she comes in, he “sli ps the note out of sight.” “To slip” (slip) means to put something, but to put it either very quickly or usually underneath or through something. “So, I slipped the  piece of paper under my book.” Well, “out of sight,” as you can guess means  so that no one can see it. “Please keep out of sight” means don’t let anyone s ee you.

The woman, Trisha, says, “Hey, what’s up?” And Brad  says, “Oh, nothing.” That expression, of course, “What’s up?” means how are t hings going, what is new with you? And the common response is either “Not mu ch,” or “Nothing.” It’s possible, of course, to say, “Oh, well, I just won the lottery,” if you won the lottery, but normally, people just say, “Oh not much.” It’s similar to when people ask, “How are you?” They’re not really asking how you ar e, they’re just being polite. So, you are supposed to say, “Oh, I’m fine.”

Well, Brad says that Trisha, his friend, “caught hi m in the act.” He said, “You caught me in the act.” That means that I was in the  middle of doing something that probably I should not have been doing. So, I w as either doing  something wrong or doing something that I should not do, that  I didn’t want you to know about. For example, if I’m going to buy my wife a p resent and I want to surprise her and I’m wrapping the present up – I’m putting p aper on it so it looks nice – the box looks nice. And she comes in the room while  I’m wrapping the present. I was trying to keep it secret from her and so I coul d say, “Oh, you caught me in the act,” meaning I didn’t want you to know about t his.

Brad says that he’s “working up the nerve” to ask D iana out. “To work up your nerve” or “to work up the nerve” means to get the c ourage, to feel like you can do it without being nervous. I’m working up the nerve to ask my boss for a raise. I need some courage, some strength to do that.

Well, Trisha finds out that Brad is writing a note to ask Diana out on a date, and she calls him a “big chicken.” When someone says, “ Oh, you’re chicken” they mean you’re afraid, you’re scared. You won’t do som ething because you’re not strong enough. “Don’t be a chicken” means don’t be scared, don’t be afraid. And Brad says that “yes, I’m a wuss.” A “wuss” (wuss) i s an informal expression which means I’m a weak person. It’s the same as chi cken. It’s a little more – something that an adult would say to someone in an informal context. Chicken is something that little kids can say. Little children  even might say that, but “wuss” is something a little stronger that would probably onl y be used by an adult.

Brad says that he doesn’t want to do it, to ask Dia na out, “in person,” meaning face to face – by talking to her, by going up to he r and talking to her with her standing right in front of him. So, when we say, “I ’m going to be there in person” means I’m not just going to call or email, I’m phys ically going to be present. Brad says that even though he works with Diana every day , when he’s working, he’s in a different “frame of mind.” A “frame of mind” is y our attitude, the way that you see things. “I’m in a working frame of mind,” meani ng right now, I want to work. That’s what I’m thinking about, that’s what I’m con centrating or focusing on. “He is in a different frame of mind,” meaning he’s thin king about work, not about personal relationships. He says that when he tries to ask her out, he often gets “tongue-tied.” The expression “tongue-tied” – “tong ue (tongue) – “tied” (tied) – means that you can’t think of the right thing to say or you can’t speak very clearly. This often happens to men in the presence of women who they are interested in. They become “tongue-tied.” I know I do. Well, I did because I’m married now. So, I don’t ask other women out.

The man says that he can’t get the words out withou t turning “beet red.” The expression “to get the words out,” means, of course , to talk. So, what he’s saying is I can’t talk without turning “beet (beet) red.” Well, “beet” – a “beet” (beet) is a vegetable that is very red and that expression is c ommon in English. He turned “beet red,” meaning he turned – his face became as red as a beet. Well, Brad is asked by Trisha why this woman is so different from  other women that he has dated, and Brad says, “Well, for one thing, she’s g orgeous.” “To be gorgeous” (gorgeous) means to be very beautiful, to be extrem ely beautiful. I tell my wife that she is gorgeous and she is.

Brad also says the woman he’s interested in is “upb eat and sweet.” “To be upbeat” – one word – (upbeat) means to be happy. So meone who always looks on the positive side, who’s optimistic, that would be “upbeat.” “To be sweet” here, when a man says a girl is sweet or a woman can also  describe a man as being sweet (sweet) – it means they’re nice, they’re kind , they’re gentle. “Sweet,” of course, also is a word we use with candy, something  with sugar in it is sweet. So, similar idea – they’re nice.

Brad also says that he thinks that he and this woma n, Diana, have “great chemistry together.” “To have great chemistry” – “c hemistry” is (chemistry) – means that they get along very well, that they are very compatible, that they laugh together, and they understand each other, and  they seem to be interested in each other, also, romantically – often, that’s t he meaning. We say, “Those people have no chemistry” – means they don’t seem t o really be interested in each other, really understand each other.

Well, Brad says that he thinks that the woman may b e nice to him “out of courtesy” and doesn’t think of him that way. “Out of courtesy” – “courtesy” is (courtesy) – is to be polite. So, it’s politeness. So, when someone says, “You should do that out of courtesy” – means to be polit e, that if you want to be nice, polite, you should do that. He says that the woman doesn’t “think of him that way.” When you say, “Oh, she doesn’t think of me th at way” we mean she’s not interested in you romantically or she doesn’t see y ou as someone she could be romantically interested in. So, that’s the meaning of “that way,” meaning in a romantic way. Well, as it turns out, it happens tha t the woman has asked Brad to go to an office party by giving him a note. The “of fice party” would be, of course, be a party for a company – it’s your company party.

Well, Trisha, Brad’s friend, has been giving him a “hard time,” meaning she has been calling him a chicken and coward and making hi m feel badly for writing a note, but the woman that he’s interested in, Diana,  wrote him a note to ask him to

go to a party. And, of course, Brad isn’t very happ y that Trisha didn’t tell him this right away. He says, “I can’t believe you’ve been s tanding there this entire time” – or “standing here this entire time,” meaning all of  this time. Trisha then says, “Well, do you want the note or what?” That expressi on “Do you want to go or what?” – the “or what?” means “or not.” It’s slight ly informal. It’s usually when you are trying to get an answer out of a person and you  may be a little impatient. “Are you coming to the store with me or what?” – you mig ht say to your girlfriend or boyfriend who doesn’t seem like they want to go or who won’t give you an answer right away.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of story]

I walked into the coffee room and saw that Brad was  writing something on a piece of paper. When he saw me come in, he slipped the note out of sight.

Trisha: Hey, what's up?

Brad: Oh, nothing.

Trisha: What were you writing?

Brad: (Laugh) All right. You caught me in the act. I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out. I was just writing a note to put on her desk.

Trisha: You mean you're going to ask her out in a n ote? You big chicken!

Brad: I admit it. I'm a wuss. I just can't do it in  person.

Trisha: But, you work with her every day.

Brad: That's different. When I'm working, I'm in a different frame of mind. But, when I even think about asking her out, I get tongu e-tied. At least in a note, I can get the words out without turning beet red.

Trisha: You've dated a lot. What's so different abo ut Diana?

Brad: Well, for one thing, she's gorgeous. She's so  upbeat and sweet. Who doesn't like her? Oh, I don't know. All I do know i s that I think we have great chemistry together. But, what if I'm wrong? Maybe s he's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way. Oh fo rget it. This was a bad idea.

 Trisha: Well, I guess you don't want this note, the n.

Brad: What note?

Trisha: I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana. She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorro w night.

Brad: You're kidding! I can't believe you've been s tanding there this entire time and didn't say anything.

Trisha: Sorry. What can I say? Now, do you want the  note or what?

Brad: Yeah, I want the note.

Trisha: Have a great time tomorrow night.

Brad: Thanks. I plan on it.

# Being an Entrepreneur

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 109: Being an Entrepreneur.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  109. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about being an entrepreneur. Let ’s get started! > I had lunch today with my friend Sam. She recently quit her job with a large company to strike out on her own. She has always be en an entrepreneur in small ways, but she decided to start her own business. the start-up she launched provided technology consulting services for small- to medium-sized companies.
> At first, she considered becoming partners with one  or two of her co-workers. She wasn't sure if she could raise the seed money s he needed for the start-up costs. But, she was able to raise the capital by ta king on a silent partner, her uncle who had a lot of investment capital, but didn 't want to be involved in the day-to-day operations of a business now that he's r etired.
> One way that Sam is able to cut down on overhead is  to make this a home-based business. She converted her garage into an office w here she and her employees could work. Since most of the work would be done on  site at her client's office, she didn't need a lot of office space.
> I asked Sam if she was nervous about quitting her j ob to start her own business. She said that it's a big risk, but that she was loo king forward to the challenge. If she fails, she said, she can always audition for Am erican Idol. Well, I thought, I've heard Sam sing. I really hope her business takes of f!

The title of this podcast is “Being an Entrepreneur ” and that word “entrepreneur” (entrepreneur) is originally a French word that we have borrowed in English. In English, it means someone who starts a business or organizes businesses – normally, someone who is taking a risk, someone who  risks some money at the business to start it.

 I had lunch, according to the story, with my friend , Sam. She had quit her job to “strike out on her own.” “To strike out on your own ” – that expression means to work for yourself, to not have a boss, to have your  own business or your own operation. The expression “to strike out” is very d ifferent than “to strike out on your own.” “To strike out” means to fail. It comes from the baseball expression where you swing the bat three times and miss the ba ll – that’s called a strike out. So, “to strike out” means to fail, but “to strike o ut on your own” means to go into business usually, on your own.

The story says that “the start-up she launched prov ides technology consulting services.” A “start-up” (start-up) is a new company , a company that is just starting up or beginning. “To launch a company” means to beg in a company. “I’m going to launch a new start-up” means I’m going to begin a new business. A “consulting business” is one where you work with other companie s, usually to provide some knowledge or some particular service. The expressio n “small and medium-sized companies” – those are two adjectives we use to des cribe how big a company is. “Small” is, of course, a company that’s not big. “M edium-sized” means, of course, something not big, but not small. We probably would n’t say a “medium company.” You can say a “small company.” You can say a “big company,” but you cannot say a “medium company.” You would have t o use that word “sized” – a “medium-sized” company.

The friend that I have, thought about becoming part ners with one or two of her co-workers. And “to be a partner” (partners) in a b usiness means that you share the cost and the benefit of the business. She wasn’ t sure if she could raise the “seed money” she needed for the start-up costs. The  expression “seed money” – (seed) “money” – two words – means that money is gi ven to start a company and you get this money, usually, from someone else, fro m a bank, or from what we call a “venture capitalist.” A “venture (venture) c apitalist” is someone who has a lot of money or has an organization that has a lot of money and they give that money to start new businesses. And, of course, they  get a percentage of the profits of the business. The word “seed” (seed) you  may know, is a word that we use in gardening or in agriculture. The seed is wha t you plant or put into the ground to make something grow and that’s the idea, that this is money, like a seed, that you hope will grow a successful business . Notice too, we use the verb “raise” – “to raise money.” If you’re going to “rai se” money or “raise” seed money (raise), we mean you’re going to try to get money, usually from other people.

“Start-up costs” – well, you know what a start-up i s, and so the “start-up costs” (costs) – those are the expenses or the things that  you need to spend money on when you are beginning a business. Sam was able to raise the “capital” by taking

on a “silent partner.” “Capital” (capital) is just another word here for money, money that is going to be used for a business. And notice again, we use the verb “raise” because capital is just another word for mo ney. A “silent partner” – two words – “silent partner” is someone who wants to gi ve money to a business, wants to be a part of the business, but doesn’t wan t to be someone who actually works everyday at the business. They don’t want to be involved in the day-to-day operations. When we say the “day-to-day,” we mean t he everyday running or operating a company.

It turns out that Sam has an uncle who has investme nt capital. Again, we know what “capital” is. “Investment” is when you give mo ney to a company or someone and you hope to get that money back plus some perce ntage of that money, that profit that would be made. One way that Sam was abl e to “cut down on overhead” was to make it a “home-based” business. “ Overhead” – all one word – (overhead) – is the cost that you have to or the mo ney you have to spend in a business that doesn’t depend on how much you produc e or how much service you provide. For example, if you have to rent an of fice building or an office in a building, the “overhead’ would be the rent that you  pay every month – the water, the electricity, the telephone bill. All of these a re “overhead.” You don’t – it doesn’t matter how much money you make or how many things you make or how much work you do, you still have to pay these, what  we would call “fixed costs.” They’re fixed, they don’t change. And that is what overhead is. “To cut down on overhead” – the expression “to cut down on somethin g” means to reduce or to have less of. “I need to cut down on all the sugar that I put in my coffee.” “I need to cut down on eating too much chocolate because I love chocolate” but it’s, of course, not good for you to eat too much chocolate.  So, I have to cut down.

A “home-based business” – Sam has a “home-based” – that’s “home” – “based” – is, you can guess, a business that you run or ope rate out of your home. You don’t rent an office anywhere. And, of course, if y ou can run it or operate the business from your home, you don’t have to pay extr a overhead for an office. Sam decided to “convert” her garage into an office.  “To convert” (convert) means to change – to change something from one thing to a nother thing. She’s converting her garage where she parks her car, into  an office where she can work. And in American – in many houses in the Unite d States, there’s often a separate garage where you park your car – a small l ittle building. Sometimes, it is attached to the house. It is connected to the house . Sometimes, as in my house, where it’s a separate garage and so, people often d on’t park their car in the garage. They park it on the street and they use the ir garage for something else like storage or in the case of my neighbor, he has a recording studio where he records music, loud music, sometimes loud music at night, but that’s his right to do that.

 Anyway, enough about my neighbors. The woman conver ts this garage into an office, and that way, she can save on overhead. Mos t of the work that she does will be done on-site at her client’s office. “On-si te” means at the place of business where the client -- and the client here is a custom er – where the customer works. If you’re doing consulting, you often do work “on-s ite” – (on site) - two words – meaning you go to someone else’s company and you do  it there. A “client,” as I said, is a customer.

Well, at the end of the story, I say that if Sam fa ils, she says she can always audition for American Idol. American Idol is a tele vision program and there are other similar programs in other countries. In Brita in, it’s called “Pop Idol.” And it’s a show where people sing – amateurs – and you vote as the audience. You call in and you vote for the person that you want to con tinue and they start with, I don’t know, 12 people. And then every week, someone  leaves the show. It’s what we would call a “reality show” and American Idol is  very popular in the United States. It’s probably one of the most popular telev ision programs in the last three or four years. “To audition” (audition) means the s ame as “to try to be on the program.” “Audition” is what you do to be part of a  movie or a play. An actor or actress has to go in front of the director or go in  front of someone and they get five minutes or ten minutes to sing or to act, and then they decide whether they’re going to hire that person for that job. I s aid at the end of the story that I really hope – since Sam cannot sing – I really hope  that her business “takes off.” And here, “to take off” means to be successful.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

# Hotel Reservations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 110: Hotel Reservations.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast number 110.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is called “Hotel Reservations.”  Le t’s travel!

[start of dialogue]

I just finished a huge project at work and I needed  some down time.  I decided to take a short vacation.  I liked the idea of a long weekend out of town.  My friend Sara offered to let me crash at her place in San Fr ancisco, but I decided to stay at a hotel instead.  Sara has a couple of roommates  and I thought it might be too crowded.

I called the toll-free reservation number for a maj or hotel chain.  The reservation agent was very helpful, after I got through the lon g phone tree.

Agent:  Dutton Hotels.  How may I help you today?

Jeff:  I wanted to check rates and availability for  your San Francisco location.

Agent:  Certainly, I can help you with that.  Will that be the downtown or waterfront location?

Jeff:  The waterfront location.

Agent:  What date do you plan to check in?

Jeff:  I’d like to check in on October 12th and che ck out the 15th.

Agent:  Okay, let me see what we have.  For how man y?

Jeff:  One.  And, if possible, I’m looking for a no n-smoking room.

Agent:  Sure, we have a non-smoking queen with an o cean view for 189 dollars or a standard room with a courtyard view for 139 do llars a night.

Jeff:  I’d like to book the standard room.

Agent:  Okay, your last name?

Jeff:  Rama.

Agent:  And your first name?

Jeff:  Jeff.

Agent:  Okay, I have you booked in a standard, non- smoking queen, checking in on October 12th and departing the 15th.  What major  credit card would you like to use to guarantee the reservation?

Jeff:  A Visa.

Agent:  The number and expiration?

Jeff:  It’s 7388-2424-3535-1818, and the expiration  is 05/08.

Agent:  Your confirmation number PD672.  Is there a nything else I can help you with?

Jeff:  No, that’s all.  Thanks.

Agent:  Have a nice day, and thanks for calling Dut ton Hotels.

[end of dialogue]

In this podcast, we are making reservations for a h otel.  I started by saying that I had just finished a huge, or large, project and I n eeded some down time.  “Down time” (two words) means time to relax.  After you’v e worked hard or had a very stressful experience, we say “I need some down time ,” time that I don’t have to work.  So, I made a call because my friend Sara in San Francisco said I could crash at her place, but I decided to go to a hotel instead.  “To crash” (crash) here means to stay at someone else’s house or apartment,  usually for a short period of time.  The verb “to crash” also can mean, of cou rse, what would happen when you hit something, like two cars have an accident a nd they crash.  But this is a completely different meaning of the verb “to crash, ” it’s an informal use of the verb.

I called the toll-free reservation number of a majo r hotel chain.  “Toll-free” (toll- free), or simply as two words, “toll free,” means t hat you are not charged for it, it’s a free call.  And in the United States numbers that  begin with 800 and 866 and 877 and 888, all of those area codes, if you will, those are all toll-free numbers. You don’t have to pay to call them, the company pay s the…for the call.  A “hotel chain” (chain) just refers to a hotel that is part of a larger company where there are many hotels.  A chain of any company is a compa ny that has lots of different locations.  McDonald’s is a good example of a resta urant chain.  Hotel chains in the United States would be things like Hilton and t he Radisson and the Marriott. These are all hotel chains, there’re many different  locations for the hotels.

In calling up the reservation number, I got through  a long phone tree.  A “phone tree” (two words) is when you call and you get an a utomatic voice message that asks you to “press one” if you want one place – one  department, “press two” if you want this, “press three” if you want that, and they want you to press that number on the telephone.  Now, it’s become common, in big companies in the United States they have what’s called “voice recogn ition,” so you don’t even have to press a number, you just say the number and they  recognize it – the computer recognizes it – speech recognition.  In any case, a  phone tree is often a pain in the neck, meaning an inconvenience, because you don ’t get to talk to anyone who is a real human being.  But I eventually, in ca lling the hotel, got a “reservation agent,” and that is someone who takes the reservations for the company on the telephone.

I asked…the first thing I asked is “I wanted to che ck rates and availability.” “Rates,” of course, are how much the hotel costs – how much the rooms – what the price of the rooms are.  “Availability” means d o you have rooms available – free, open – for the dates I want to go.  So it’s c ommon when you first call a reservation agent to say, “Yes, I want to check rat es and availability.”  The reason you would say that is you may not necessaril y want to make a reservation.  If you want to make a reservation, an d you know you’re going to make a reservation, you say, “Hi, I’d like to…I’m c alling to make a reservation.” But if you say, “I’m calling to check rates and ava ilability,” well, you’re just getting the information; you may decide to make a reservati on, you may not.

The reservation agent asks me if I want the downtow n or waterfront location. Well, “downtown,” you know, is the central part of the city, usually where many businesses are located.  “Waterfront” (all one word  – waterfront) is the area that’s right next to a lake or an ocean.  So, a waterfront  hotel would usually have a view of the ocean.  I said I wanted the waterfront locat ion, and the agent asked me when I planned to check in.  Of course, to “check i n” (two words) means to arrive at the hotel.  The opposite would be to “check out, ” which is to leave the hotel.

 The agent said that they had available a non-smokin g queen with an ocean view for 189 or a standard room with a courtyard view for 139 a night.  A “queen,” of course, is a size of the bed.  There are double bed s, which fit two people very…but not very much room; queen bed is bigger.  A king bed is the biggest kind of bed, and the queen bed is the second bigges t.  A “ocean view” would, of course be a room with a view, or you can see the oc ean from your room.  “Non- smoking,” in most American hotels there are rooms t hat are designated, or are labeled non-smoking; you can’t smoke in the room.  The “courtyard view” (courtyard – all one word), a courtyard view would be a room that looks onto other rooms in the hotel, into the center of the ho tel.  A “courtyard” is when you have a building that has a space in the middle of t he building, and parts of the building go around a central area that we call the courtyard.

I decide to book the standard room.  “To book” (boo k) here means same as to reserve or to make a reservation.  The “standard ro om” would be the normal, usually the cheapest room in the hotel – a standard  room.  If you want more expensive room you can get a suite (suite), those a re usually bigger rooms.

The reservation agent asks me my name and I tell he r.  Then she says, “What major credit card would you like to use to guarante e the reservation?”  A “major credit card” (three words), “major” here…well, you know what a credit card is.  A major credit card” would be from a…from a big compa ny, and the two biggest are, of course, Visa and MasterCard.  In other coun tries there are, for example in Japan there is the JCB card, there’s also the Ameri can Express card, and there are a few others as well.  These are major credit c ards.  To “guarantee the reservation” means that I have to put money…they ta ke my credit card number in case I don’t cancel and I don’t show up to the hote l, they’re going to charge me anyway.  So, it’s a way for the hotel to protect it self so it doesn’t lose money.

I then give the women my Visa credit card number.  Of course, that isn’t actually my Visa credit card that you heard in the dialogue.   In fact, that wasn’t even a Visa credit card number, it was just a made up numb er.  I give the credit card number, usually in groups of four numbers, there are 16 numbers on a credit card, and I give the expiration date as “05/08,” me aning May 2008; “05” for the month, “08” for the year.

The agent gives me a “confirmation number,” and tha t’s a number that the hotel computer gives her so that I can…they can find my r eservation if I have a problem.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a na tive rate of speech.

# Last Minute Holiday Shopping

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 111: Last Minute Holiday Shopping.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 111. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan from the Center for Educational Deve lopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to talk about last min ute holiday shopping. Let’s go! > Every year, I tell myself that I won't procrastinat e in doing my holiday shopping. And, every year, I end up with a shopping list as l ong as your arm and about 24 hours to get it all done. Waiting until the last mi nute means that I have to brave the crowds out doing their last minute shopping.
> First, I have to find a place to park in the parkin g lot, which is always packed. Then, I have to fight off the bargain hunters who a re there for the holiday markdowns. With so many shoppers, the shelves are u sually a mess and a lot of items are out of stock. When I've finally picked ou t what I want to buy, there are usually long lines at the register. Just when I'm a bout to check out, I always remember that I've forgotten one last thing. It nev er fails!
> When I get home with the presents, I have to wrap t hem. Hopefully, I haven't forgotten to get gift wrap, ribbons and bows, and h oliday cards. By the time I'm finished, I'm exhausted and I feel like Scrooge. Ba  humbug!
> Why do I do this to myself every year? Next year, I 'm starting my holiday shopping in September. Then again, I said that last  year.

Today we are doing some last minute holiday shoppin g. When we say we’re doing something at the “last minute,” we mean we’re  doing it right before it has to be done. We’re waiting until we have no more time l eft. This is, of course, about holiday shopping and that usually is around Christm as or Hanukkah or whatever it is you celebrate. I mentioned that every year, I  tell myself I won’t “procrastinate” in doing my holiday shopping. “To procrastinate” (p rocrastinate) means to wait until the last minute. Another expression we’d say is “to put it off.” “To put

something off” means to say, “Oh, I’ll do it later,  not right now, maybe later” – that’s procrastinating. Students, for example, who wait until the night before a big exam to start studying, are procrastinating.

I say that I “end up with a shopping list as long a s your arm” every year. The expression “to end up with” means that as a result of or because of something. For example, here because I procrastinate, I end up  with a long shopping list. The shopping list, I mentioned, is as long as your arm. And that’s an expression meaning something that’s very, very long. Usually, we use that expression in talking about a list of things or a listing of item s of some sort – basically, a long list. I said that waiting until the last minute mea ns that “I had to brave the crowds out doing their last minute shopping.” Well, we’ve talked about what it means to wait until the last minute. “To brave the crowds” –  “to brave” (brave) – means to have to put up with or tolerate the crowds of peopl e. A “crowd,” of course, is many people. So “to brave the crowds” means that I have to go out with – or go out to a store with many people and I have to be ab le to put up with that – to tolerate it, to not let it bother me.

“Last minute shopping,” of course, is what we’ve be en talking about here, shopping at the last minute. Now, when you go the s tore near the holidays in December, they’re always “packed.” And to be “packe d” (packed) means that they’re full – full of people. The opposite of “pac ked” would be that they were dead – that is, there was no one there.

I said I had “to fight off the bargain hunters who were there for the holiday mark- downs.” “To fight off” literally means that someone  is attacking you, and you have to defend yourself. But, of course, we’re not using  this literally. This is a metaphor – it’s an analogy. You’re not actually fighting peo ple. Well, sometimes, if it’s a lot of difficult people you might be fighting, but normally, “to fight off” here is not to be taken literally. We don’t mean we actually fight  people.

“Bargain hunters” are people who are looking for a bargain. And a “bargain” (bargain) is a low price on something – what we wou ld call a “good deal.” Someone says, “Oh, that’s a bargain” – means that’s  a good price – a low price. A “hunter” is someone, normally, who, for example, hunts animals like deer or whatever animal – geese – but here again, it’s not literally a hunter. It’s someone who is looking for. So, to hunt can also mean in th is context, to look for. A “markdown” (markdown) is when a store reduces or lo wers the price. So, often, during the holiday shopping season there will be lo wer prices at the store and these are called “markdowns.”

Well, I said that with so many shoppers, “the shelv es are usually a mess and a lot of items are out of stock.” The “shelves” are t he place where, in a store, they put the things that you want to buy. You can have a  shelf – is the singular – “shelves” (shelves) is the plural. The idea of it b eing a “mess” (mess) means that nothing is in order, that everything is thrown toge ther and it’s not very neat. “To be a mess” is the opposite of to be neat. “Out of s tock” – three words – “out of stock” – means that the store doesn’t have any more  left. It runs out, we would say. “To run out” means that you sell all of the on es you have and you don’t have any more to sell.

I said that I finally “picked out” what I wanted to  buy. “To pick out” means to select, to choose, but there are usually long lines  at the “register.” The “register” – sometimes called the “cash register” – is where y ou go in a store to pay for what you are going to buy. And when you are going t o pay for your merchandise, your items, you are going to check-out. “I want to check-out at the register” means I want to pay for my things at the register.

I said that usually, I always forget at least one t hing. And I use the expression “It never fails” – means it always happens. “It never f ails. It always rains when you go to the beach,” meaning every time I go to the be ach, it rains – “It never fails.”

When I get home with the presents or the gifts, I h ave to “wrap” them. And to “wrap (wrap) a present or a gift” means to put pape r – colored paper usually – around it and you tape it up so it looks nice. The paper is called “gift wrap” – two words – “gift” “wrap.” Ribbons and bows are also so metimes used on presents. A “ribbon” is usually a half-inch, maybe one inch pie ce of material that you – It’s like a big piece of string or rope that you put around t he present. And a “bow” is like a little flower that sits on top of the present that is made out of, usually, the same material as the ribbon.

A “holiday card” – when you have a gift, you often give a holiday card – and whatever holiday you celebrate. I said, “By the tim e I’m finished, I’m exhausted.” “To be exhausted” means to be very tired, to be so tired, you can’t do anything else. “I often feel like scrooge. Ba humbug!” Well,  “scrooge” (scrooge) is a fictional person. He is a symbol for someone who do esn’t like Christmas or who doesn’t like the holidays. Charles Dickens wrote a story called “The Christmas Carol” and the main character – the main person in the story – was “Scrooge.” “Scrooge” was an old business owner who was mean an d didn’t like Christmas, didn’t like children. So, someone says, “Don’t be a  scrooge” they mean don’t be like Scrooge – mean and hate Christmas or hate New Year’s or whatever the holiday. The expression “Ba humbug” – and that’s tw o words – “ba” (ba) and “humbug” (humbug) – was something from the story th at Scrooge would say.

Someone would say, “Merry Christmas!” and he’d say,  “Oh, ba humbug!” – means I don’t like it. I don’t believe in it. I thi nk we shouldn’t bother doing it. And it’s usually related to someone talking about Chris tmas and not liking Christmas or not wanting to celebrate Christmas.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech. > Every year, I tell myself that I won't procrastinat e in doing my holiday shopping. And, every year, I end up with a shopping list as l ong as your arm and about 24 hours to get it all done. Waiting until the last mi nute means that I have to brave the crowds out doing their last minute shopping.

# Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 112: Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 112. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is very appropriate. It’s called Ch ristmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa. Let’s get started! > The holidays in my family are very diverse. Our cus tom is to celebrate Christmas every year as a religious observance, complete with  Advent wreathes and Midnight Mass. Most of my in-laws observe Christmas  purely as a secular holiday, with the focus on exchanging gifts, stocki ngs, a Christmas tree, and other traditional customs. There is a lot of listen ing to Christmas music‚ my favorites are the carols sung by Nat King Cole ‚ an d sometimes even some eggnog. My nieces and nephews enjoy the day the mos t, especially when they get to open the gifts under the tree from Santa Cla us.
> One of my brother-in-laws is Jewish, and so he cele brates Hanukkah, the festival of lights, when he lights a candle each of the eigh t nights on the menorah. My niece gets a small gift each night of Hanukkah, and , of course, spins the dreidel. With both celebrations in the same family, we somet imes call it Chrismukkah.
> But the holidays are no longer just Christmas and H anukkah in the United States. More recently, there are some people who celebrate a new holiday, Kwanzaa. This is a mostly African- American event, with para des and other parties to highlight African-American heritage. Started here i n Los Angeles, this celebration runs for 1 week after Christmas, and is a mostly se cular celebration.
> Whatever tradition you celebrate, December is alway s a festive time of year.

Today, we are talking about the holidays. When some one says, at least in the United States, “the holidays” – with the definite a rticle “the” – they’re usually referring to Christmas, Hanukkah, and possibly Kwan zaa. These are December

holidays, for the most part, celebrated by differen t groups in the United States, and, of course, all over the world.

The holidays, I said, in my family, are very “diver se.” And to be “diverse” or “diverse” (diverse) means that there are many diffe rent types, many different varieties. Our custom in the family where I grew up  – and a “custom,” of course, (custom) is like a tradition. Our custom is to cele brate Christmas as a religious observance. A “religious observance” means that we celebrate it as a religious holiday. So, a “religious observance” could be a ho liday. It could be another religious event. Part of the traditional religious observances of Christmas include “Advent wreathes and Midnight Mass.” An “Advent wre ath” – well “Advent” (Advent) – is the four week period before Christmas , which in some Christian churches, is celebrated as a special time of prepar ation. “Advent” means the coming or to come and “wreathes” are circular, roun d pieces of usually, some sort of parts of a tree or branches – green and the  wreath has a place in it for four different candles, each candle representing on e of the weeks before Christmas. “Midnight Mass” – a Mass (Mass) is relig ious ceremony in the Catholic Church, as well as in some other churches,  call their religious celebration a “Mass.” “Midnight Mass” is, of course , Mass at midnight - the very first moment of Christmas. And it is traditional in  many churches in the United States and other places, to have a Mass at midnight  with a full choir and so forth.

I said that many of my “in-laws” observe Christmas purely as a secular holiday. “In-laws” (in-laws) refers to anyone that you are r elated to by marriage. So, my wife’s mother is my mother-in-law. My wife’s brothe rs and sisters are my brothers and sisters-in-law. The expression “purely as a sec ular holiday” – “purely” (purely) means solely or only. “Secular” (secular) means it’s not religious. So, when someone talks about a “secular” event, they me an a non-religious event. In a traditional secular Christmas, there is, of cours e, exchanging of gifts and stockings and a Christmas tree. “To exchange gifts”  means you give me a gift and I give you a gift. So, we exchange. Each person  receives something. “Christmas stockings” is also a very common custom in the United States. Most of these customs come from Europe, particularly Nor thern Europe. And Christmas stockings are literally big socks that pe ople either put on their fireplace – hang on their fire place or put somewhere in the house. And the idea is that you are supposed to put gifts inside of this big so ck or stocking. “Stocking” is just another word for a big sock.

A “Christmas tree” is you, I’m sure know, a large g reen tree that people decorate. They put things on it – lights and what we call “or naments.” An “ornament” (ornament) is a decoration that you hang or put on a Christmas tree. The Christmas music that I like to listen to are “carol s.” And “carols” (carols) is a

Christmas song. And my favorite singer of Christmas  songs is Nat King Cole. Nat (nat) King Cole (cole) is a famous – in the United States anyway – a famous singer from the 1940’s and 50’s. He has a wonderful  deep voice. So, if you have a chance, try to listen to some songs sung by Nat K ing Cole.

One of the things that some families use to celebra te Christmas is “eggnog.” “Eggnog” (eggnog) is a drink that’s made of eggs an d cream and usually a little alcohol, although, you can have non-alcoholic eggno g – eggnog without alcohol – as well. I said that my nieces and nephews enjoy this holiday because they get to open their gifts under the tree from “Santa Clau s.” It’s traditional to put Christmas gifts underneath the Christmas tree and t hen either on Christmas Eve in some families, or on Christmas morning, the 25th , we open up the gifts or the presents. “Santa Claus,” of course, is a mostly com mercial symbol of Christmas. And Santa Claus is supposed to go around and give g ifts to all the good boys and girls in the world. So, hopefully, you will get  something from Santa Claus this year.

I mentioned that the other – one of the other holid ays we celebrate in December, is called “Hanukkah.” And “Hanukkah,” which can be spelled in English a couple of different ways, is a Jewish celebration. It’s so metimes called the “Festival of Lights.” A “festival” is another word for a celebra tion. And it is a celebration, a commemoration where they – the Jewish community – r emembers a famous event in Jewish history and the celebration is usua lly observed by lighting a candle each of 8 nights. So, Hanukkah lasts or take s 8 days. It’s an eight-day celebration. And each night of Hanukkah, you light another candle on what’s called a menorah. And a “menorah” (menorah) is a ca ndle stick holder. It’s a name of the thing that you put the candles into to hold them.

My niece gets a gift every night of Hanukkah and I said, she, of course, spins the “dreidal.” A “dreidal” (dreidal) is a Yiddish word,  a word from the Yiddish language (Yiddish) and “Yiddish” was a language tha t was popular among Jews in Europe and is still spoken in parts of the Unite d States where immigrants came speaking this language. Yiddish is a combination of  German with Hebrew and other language words as part of it. And many Yiddis h words are very well known to Americans – some very common words in Yiddish. A nd someday we’ll do a podcast about words in Yiddish in American English.  I mentioned that the “dreidal,” then, is something that my niece spins. And a “dreidal” – another word for “dreidal” is a “top” (top). And a “top” as a to y, is something that you spin or you twist quickly and then it continues spinning on  its own. And it’s a very poplar toy among children, of course.

One of the terms that has been invented in the last  few years to talk about the holidays, particularly in families where there’s bo th a Christian and a Jewish member, is a term called “Chrismukkah,” which is a combination of Christmas and Hanukkah. Of course, it’s not a real celebratio n. It’s sort of a joke word, to talk about celebrating these two important holidays .

There is a new holiday – relatively new holiday tha t is celebrated in some parts of the United States, and that is called “Kwanzaa.” “K wanzaa” (Kwanzaa) is celebrated by many, or at least some, African Ameri cans. And “African Americans” or blacks – the more common term now is African American – have a celebration that begins the day after Christmas, De cember 26th, and continues on until – for one week. This is mostly a secular n on-religious celebration, and it is a celebration of the African American heritage o r the history and the culture of the African American people. December 26th is the b eginning of Kwanzaa. December 26th is also called “Boxing Day” in Canada  as well as in Great Britain. It’s not called “Boxing Day” in the United States, but if you live in Great Britain, or in Canada, you will know that the day after Christm as is called “Boxing Day.” And it is a public or national holiday in these countri es. I’m not exactly sure why it’s called “Boxing Day.” Some people think it’s because  the gifts were given the day after Christmas to the servants in a rich household  – the people who worked for them got their Christmas gifts in boxes on the day after Christmas – that’s one theory.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech.

[start of story]

The holidays in my family are very diverse. Our cus tom is to celebrate Christmas every year as a religious observance, complete with  Advent wreathes and Midnight Mass. Most of my in-laws observe Christmas  purely as a secular holiday, with the focus on exchanging gifts, stocki ngs, a Christmas tree, and other traditional customs.

# New Year's Party

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 113: A New Year’s Party.

Hello and welcome to English as a Second Language P odcast episode 113. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from t he Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. T oday’s podcast is going to be, appropriately enough, about New Year’s. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

I walked into the office and saw Rob with his head down on his desk. I tapped him on the shoulder.

Christy: You look like you had a good New Year's.

Rob: Yeah, too good. I'm trying to catch up on slee p.

Christy: Oh yeah? What did you do?

Rob: I went to a New Year's party at the Key Club o n the Sunset Strip with a few buddies of mine. The fireworks at midnight were gre at. I met this great girl there, too. Champagne was flowing everywhere and I had a g reat time.

Christy: Sounds like fun. What was the girl's name?

Rob: Uh, it was Rosa or Rebecca, or something.

Christy: I see you really got to know her well. But , I thought you and Vince were going to the Rose Bowl Parade.

Rob: Yeah, we did. After we left the Key Club, we c hanged and took our stuff down to the parade route. We managed to find a plac e to camp out. There were tons of people there already. We ended up striking up conversations with some out-of-towners from Cleveland, and a couple who kne w the grand marshal for this year's parade.

Christy: How was the parade itself?

Rob: It was great, I think. I fell asleep half way through it, but the floats I saw were pretty amazing.

Christy: It sounds like you need a few days to reco ver.

Rob: Yeah, definitely. Wake me up when the boss com es in, will you?

Christy: Yeah, right. Hey, heads up. Here she comes .

[end of dialogue]

Today we are talking about the tradition of the New  Year’s Eve party on December 31st – if you celebrated that. I used to c elebrate New Year’s Eve, but as I get older, I don’t – I’m not as interested in going out to a bar or restaurant with friends. Mainly because there are a lot of not  very intelligent people who drink too much and it’s not that safe anymore on the roads – at least that’s my opinion. So, I usually stay at home. I don’t go out . I don’t go to a restaurant or a bar. I just stay at home. But the person in our sto ry here, Rob, did go out and celebrate.

Our story begins with Christy, the woman, saying th at she walked into the office and saw Rob with his “head down” on his desk. To ha ve your “head down on the desk” means, of course, that you are sleeping or re sting with your head sitting on top of your desk. So, Christy tapped him on the sho ulder. “To tap” (tap) means to touch lightly. Usually, it’s just a small touch tha t’s quick on the arm or the shoulder and it’s to get someone’s attention. You d on’t punch them. You don’t hit them hard. You just take your fingers and you touch  them to their shoulder, usually once or twice, to get their attention.

Well, she tapped him on the shoulder and she said, “It looks like you had a good new year’s,” meaning a good New Year’s Eve celebrat ion. Rob says, “Yeah, too good.” When we say – someone asks us a question and  they say, “Was it good?” “Yeah, too good,” meaning it was – I did too much. I celebrated too much, in this case. He says he’s trying to “catch up on sleep.” “ To catch up on sleep” means that you didn’t get enough sleep and now you’re try ing to make up or catch up – you’re trying to get that sleep back, if you will. “To catch up to someone” or “to catch up on something” means that you are behind wh ere you should be and you are trying to get further along to a certain place – here means, just to get more sleep.

Christy asks Rob what he did for New Year’s Eve, an d Rob says he went to the “Key Club on Sunset Strip.” “The Key” (key) – like the key to your car – “The Key

Club” is a famous nightclub, a place where you can dance and drink and celebrate. It’s a very exclusive club – very diffic ult to get in to the Key Club. It’s located in an area of Los Angeles that’s fairly fam ous in the United States called the “Sunset Strip.” “Sunset” (sunset) is the name of the street or the avenue and “The Strip” (strip) just means – when we talk about  a strip on a street we mean a part of the street usually where there are lots of businesses, restaurants, entertainment, bars, that sort of thing. So, any st reet can have a strip. But the “Sunset Strip” is very famous. It’s in Hollywood. I t’s actually in the neighborhood of Hollywood in California. Some people don’t know that Hollywood is not a separate city. Hollywood is just the name of one re gion or one part of the city of Los Angeles. So, Sunset Strip is in the neighborhoo d of Hollywood. It’s also part of another city called “West Hollywood.” And this i s where all of the celebrities and stars, ESL Podcast hosts – all of us go up ther e to mix and talk to the rich and famous, right? And so, Sunset Strip is a place where there are a lot of famous restaurants and night clubs and so forth and  one of them is “The Key Club.” And it’s always very crowded. The street is always very crowded on Sunset Strip. It’s as famous – well, not almost qui te as famous but it’s sort of like Times Square in New York City where they have the b ig New Year celebration every year. Sunset Strip is sort of like that for L os Angeles, except it’s mostly cars, not people like you find in New York.

Rob says that he watched the “fireworks.” The “fire works” – all one word – (fireworks)  is what we sometimes call “Pyrotechnic s.” They are colorful lights and you shoot them up into the air. They’re actuall y – go up in the air and they explode and you have fireworks for any big celebrat ion in the United States, like the 4th of July, and in this case, for New Year’s E ve. At least in big cities, they often have fireworks. And they’re very beautiful to  watch.

Rob says that the “champagne was flowing everywhere .” “Champagne,” of course, is originally -  or the true champagne is f rom a region in France, but there are many different types of what people call “champ agne.” Basically, it is a type of wine that has bubbles in it and it’s used for ce lebrations. And traditionally, on New Year’s Eve, you drink champagne to celebrate. “ The champagne was flowing” (flowing) – “to flow” that is a word we us e for a river – “a river flows” – means it goes forward. It moves forward and there’s  a lot of water. So when we say, the champagne was “flowing” we mean there was a lot of champagne being served, being poured and being drunk by people.

Rob says he also met a girl at the party, but he do esn’t remember her name, which of course, is not a very gentleman thing to d o. I would never do that, but then again, I am married. So, I don’t talk to other  women. Well, I talk to other women, I just you know.

 Christy says – asked what Rob did and said that she  thought he and his friend Vince were going to the “Rose Bowl parade.” “The Ro se Bowl parade” is an annual celebration on the 1st of January in the cit y of Pasadena, which is located right next to Los Angeles. It’s very famous in the United States, everyone has heard of the Rose Bowl parade. It takes place on Ne w Year’s Day and it’s a parade to celebrate the New Year’s, but also it’s a  parade that is connected to a football game – American football game – that is pl ayed in a stadium called “The Rose Bowl” – that’s where we get the Rose Bowl para de. The parade is sometimes called the “Tournament of Roses.” I’m not  sure how it exactly started. It was probably a way for people in Southern Califo rnia to celebrate. Now, it is nationally televised. So, anywhere in the United St ates, you can watch the Rose Bowl parade as well as the Rose Bowl game. And in A merican Football, the game is between two college teams and these are con sidered the two best teams. So, it’s sort of like – now, it is sort of l ike the national championship for American college football. This year, the Universit y of Southern California (USC), which is where I went to school, is in the Rose Bow l – playing against I don’t remember – some other team, but it’s not important because the other team will lose.

Anyway, Rob says that after they left the Key Club on the Sunset Strip, he and his friend changed and took their stuff down to the  parade route. When someone says, “I changed” they mean they changed their clot hes, they took off their clothes and put on new clothes. “Stuff.” You probab ly know (stuff) is just a general word in English for things. So, they took o ff their stuff and went down to the parade route. There are literally hundreds of t housands of people who watch the Rose Bowl parade on the street. So, if you want  to get a good seat, you have to go the night before or no later than midnight an d you have to camp – you have to sleep on the street – in order to get a good pla ce to watch the parade the following day. It takes place the following morning .

Well, Vince and Rob decided to camp out. And to “ca mp out” – two words – means basically the same as to camp, to go somewher e outside and to sleep. He says there were “tons of people” there already. Thi s is a very informal but common expression. When people mean a lot, or very many, they’ll often say, “There were tons” (tons) or “there was a ton” of pe ople. Literally, a “ton” is a unit of measurement for weight. But here, it means a lot  of people. So, when somebody says, “there was a ton of people,” they do n’t mean that all the people together weighed a ton – that’s possible. But they mean a lot of people.

He says that – Rob says that he and Vince ended up striking up conversation with some “out-of-towners.” “To strike up a convers ation” – the verb “to strike up”

here means to begin, to start conversations. And it ’s a verb that we use – “to strike up” – particularly for that idea of conversa tion, usually, with someone that you don’t know. So, I was standing on the bus, wait ing for the bus and I struck up a conversation with the person standing next to me – starting a conversation with a stranger. In this case, the strangers were “out-o f-towners.” And “out-of-towners” – that’s three words hyphenated – “out-of-towners” are people that live – that don’t live, rather – that do not live in your town,  in your city, and are visiting from another city. So, someone from Texas, coming to wat ch the Rose Bowl would be an “out-of-towner.”

The out-of-towners they talked to were from Clevela nd. “Cleveland” is a city in Ohio, which is in the eastern part of the United St ates. Rob says that a “couple” – they talked to a “couple” who knew the grand marsha l of this year’s parade. A “couple” here means a – usually, a married couple o r two people who are romantically involved – are a “couple.” The “grand marshal” in a parade – at least in the United States – there’s one person, usually a famous person, who is made the – sort of the president or the head of the para de. And the word we use for that is “grand” – two words – “grand” “marshal.” the “grand marshal” is sort of the honorary head or leader of the parade and he or she  has their own – what we call a “float.” In a parade – the Rose Bowl parade – has lots of different “floats” (floats). A “float” is usually a big car or truck a nd it’s decorated. In the Rose Bowl, all of the floats are decorated with flowers. And t hat’s what you see going down the street, and sometimes, the float will have a bi g balloon on it or something very fancy.

Christy asked Rob how the parade was “itself,” mean ing the actual parade. And he says that he “fell asleep halfway through it.” “ So, he didn’t even make it to the end of the parade.” But the floats he saw were pret ty amazing and, of course, we just explained what a float is. Christy says at the  end of our dialogue, “It sounds like you need a few days to recover.” “To recover” (recover) means to get over a particularly difficult time. For example, if you are sick, we say, “I need time to recover.” I need time to rest, to go back to normal  again. Rob says, yes he does and tells Christy to wake him up when the boss come s in. And Christy says, “Hey, heads up. Here she comes.” “Heads up” – two w ords – is an expression, an exclamation really, we use when we’re trying to warn someone. If somebody says, “Heads up!” they mean that there is something  dangerous or something that they need to be aware of, they need to look ar ound. At a baseball game, if somebody hits a ball and it’s going in to where the  people are sitting, you may say, “Heads up!” meaning look out, you may get hit by a ball. You have to be watching. And that’s the use of the expression.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

 [start of dialogue]

I walked into the office and saw Rob with his head down on his desk. I tapped him on the shoulder.

Christy: You look like you had a good New Year's.

Rob: Yeah, too good. I'm trying to catch up on slee p.

Christy: Oh yeah? What did you do?

Rob: I went to a New Year's party at the Key Club o n the Sunset Strip with a few buddies of mine. The fireworks at midnight were gre at. I met this great girl there, too. Champagne was flowing everywhere and I had a g reat time.

Christy: Sounds like fun. What was the girl's name?

Rob: Uh it was Rosa or Rebecca, or something.

Christy: I see you really got to know her well. But , I thought you and Vince were going to the Rose Bowl Parade.

Rob: Yeah, we did. After we left the Key Club, we c hanged and took our stuff down to the parade route. We managed to find a plac e to camp out. There were tons of people there already. We ended up striking up conversations with some out-of-towners from Cleveland, and a couple who kne w the grand marshal for this year's parade.

Christy: How was the parade itself?

Rob: It was great, I think. I fell asleep half way through it, but the floats I saw were pretty amazing.

Christy: It sounds like you need a few days to reco ver.

Rob: Yeah, definitely. Wake me up when the boss com es in, will you?

Christy: Yeah, right. Hey, heads up. Here she comes .

# Writing a Thank You Note

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 114: Writing a Thank You Letter.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 114. Welcome back. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, fr om the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is going to be about writing a Thank you letter. Let’s get started! > Dear Jake,
> I wanted to thank you for all of the help you've gi ven me over the past several weeks. Being laid up with pneumonia really caught m e off-guard, but you went above and beyond in taking care of me. Before I got  sick, we had only known each other as neighbors and only for a short time. That's why it's so amazing that when I called you, you came running. You pulled out  all the stops to help me in every way. You ran my errands, kept me company, and  made sure I had everything I needed. Being on my own in L.A., I'm s o grateful to have a good friend like you. You're truly one in a million.
> Have a wonderful holiday and I'll see you when you get back.
> Kate

Today we listened to a personal thank you letter. A  thank you note that you might write someone who has done you a favor – that is wh o has helped you. It begins with “Dear Jake,.” If it’s an informal note or a le tter, we usually – or email – we usually use a comma. If it’s more formal such as “D ear Mr. Johnson,” and it’s a business letter, we would use a colon (:) – two dot s. But here, as an informal letter, it is a comma.

Well, Kate, the person writing this note, says that  “I wanted to thank you for all the help you’ve given me over the past several week s. Being laid up with pneumonia really caught me off-guard.” The expressi on “to be laid-up” means that you are usually in your bed, you’re sick or ma ybe you broke your leg and you

say, “Yeah, I’m laid-up” – means I can’t get out of  my bed. I need someone to take care of me. In this case, Kate is laid-up with  “pneumonia.” And “pneumonia” which is spelled (pneumonia) is a kind of sickness that you get – often causes you to cough, have problems breathing sometimes, an d can be very serious. In this case, it wasn’t too serious. We’re never very serious here on ESL Podcast, anyway.

And Kate says that this “pneumonia” really “caught her off-guard.” “To catch someone” or “to catch you off-guard” – and “off-gua rd” is hyphenated – (off)- (guard) – “to be caught off guard” – means that you  weren’t expecting it and that usually it’s something that causes you a problem. S o, for example, I was driving today on the freeway here in Los Angeles, and sudde nly, it started to rain and I didn’t have a coat. I was caught off-guard. I was s urprised and was not prepared.

Well, Kate was caught off-guard, but her friend, Ja ke, went “above and beyond” in taking care of me. The expression “above and bey ond” is actually a short form of a longer expression “above and beyond” the call of duty (duty). “Above and beyond the call of duty” or simply, “above and beyo nd” means that you did more than what one would reasonably expect. So, you help ed me more than you had to or more than I could have expected you to. The e xpression “the call of duty” – “duty” (duty) here means your obligation. So, you d id more than what you had to. That word “duty” is also used as a tax on things th at you bring in to another country. So, if you come to the United States and y ou bring, I don’t know, several boxes of cigars – expensive cigars. Well, you proba bly will have to pay a tax when you come here and that’s called a duty. But he re, “duty” is obligation – something you have to do.

Kate says that before she got sick, she and Jake ha d only known each other as neighbors and only for a short time. But it was ama zing, she thinks, that when she called him, he “came running.” When someone – y ou say someone “comes running” they don’t really mean they’re actually ru nning. They mean that you came to my assistance – you came to help me very qu ickly. I saw a woman trying to open a door with her young baby. And I ca me running and opened the door because I’m such a gentleman. Well, that’s wha t happened here – Jake came running.

And Kate says that he “pulled out all the stops” to  help her in every way. The expression “to pull out all the stops” means to hel p someone, do everything you can to help someone. I believe the expression origi nally comes from when you play an organ like in a church. The “stops” are wha t controls the sound – the loudness of the sound in part. So, to pull out all the stops of the organ would be

to make it play as loud as you could. It’s another way of saying to do as much as you can – “to pull out all the stops.”

Well, that’s what Jake did here. He ran errands, ke pt Kate company, and made sure she had everything she needed. “To run errands ” (errands) means to go to the grocery store and buy food, to go to the post o ffice and mail a letter – anything that you – any small thing that you have to do as part of your daily life. You have to get your car washed or you have to get gas for your car – these are all “errands” – things that you have to do, usually  requiring you to leave our house. And the expression we use is to “run errands .” So, in the story, Jake “runs errands” for Kate. He also keeps her company. “To k eep someone company” means that you stay with someone who may be lonely and you talk to them. So, the boy sees the girl sitting by herself and crying . He goes over and he “keeps her company.” Kate says that since she is “on her o wn,” meaning she’s by herself, she doesn’t have probably very many famili es – or I’m sorry, many friends or family with her in Los Angeles. “To be o n your own” just means to be by yourself – to be alone.

Since she’s on her own, she was grateful to have a good friend like you. “To be grateful” (grateful) means that you are thankful, t hat you appreciate something. I am grateful that the rain stopped before I had to g et out of my car. It’s the same as saying, “I’m thankful for.” So, to be “grateful”  – in this case, she’s grateful to Jake.

She ends – towards the end of the letter, she says,  “You’re truly one in a million.” “You’re” – “you are” – “You’re truly one in a milli on.” “Truly” (truly) here means you are – in truth – It’s absolutely true that you are one in a million. And so, we use that adverb “truly” when we’re trying to emphas ize something. We’re trying to really tell the person that we really believe this.  Well, “you’re truly one in a million” – the idea here is that you’re very rare. That peop le who are so nice and so generous with their time, that’s very unusual. So, the expression “one in a million” means it’s very rare. It doesn’t happen very often.

Well, Kate ends her letter by saying, “Have a wonde rful holiday and I’ll see you when you get back” – probably Jake has left – signe d, Kate. Now, she doesn’t have a closing. You could say, if it were an inform al note, you might say “Yours” (yours) comma, or you might just say something like  “Thanks” comma. Or you might want to say, “Take it easy,” meaning hope eve rything is okay. People have different ways of closing their letters. But here, she just signs it “Kate.”

Now let’s listen to the letter this time at a nativ e rate of speech.

[start of story]

Dear Jake,

I wanted to thank you for all of the help you've gi ven me over the past several weeks. Being laid up with pneumonia really caught m e off-guard, but you went above and beyond in taking care of me. Before I got  sick, we had only known each other as neighbors and only for a short time. That's why it's so amazing that when I called you, you came running. You pulled out  all the stops to help me in every way. You ran my errands, kept me company, and  made sure I had everything I needed. Being on my own in L.A., I'm s o grateful to have a good friend like you. You're truly one in a million.

Have a wonderful holiday and I'll see you when you get back.

Kate

# New Year's Resolution

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 115: New Year’s Resolution.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 115. I am Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is going to be about making a resol ution or a promise to yourself for the New Year. Let’s go! > This is the time of year when people make their New  Year's resolutions. At the beginning of a new year, people take stock of their  lives and decide to make some changes.
> A lot of people want to get into shape. They vow to  go to the health club and work out every day. Many people also decide to go o n a diet. After overindulging at holiday meals, people feel the need to cut back and to shed some extra pounds. Many people also promise to quit smoking or  drinking to live healthier lives.
> Whatever resolution you make, don't forget the most  important one: Promise not to have to make the same resolution next year.

Well, it’s that time of the year where people often  make a New Year’s resolution. A “resolution” (resolution) is basically a promise that you make, usually to yourself. You say, “Well, this year I’m going to ex ercise everyday” or “This year, I’m going to read more books.” Whatever the idea of  improvement you have, that becomes often your New Year’s resolution.

Well, in our story, it begins by saying that people  make their New Year’s resolutions. And people like to “take stock” of the ir lives and decide to make some changes. “To take stock” – two words – “take” and “stock” (stock) – means to examine, to look at, to step back and say, “Hmm,  where is my life now?” That word “stock,” of course, is also used for – in busi ness – for finance on – “stock” is ownership – part ownership – in a company or busine ss. There is such a thing as

the “stock exchange” like the New York Stock Exchan ge where they buy and sell stocks. But this is a different meaning here. “To t ake stock” means to think about, to examine, usually some important point of your li fe or in this case, for the New Year.

One thing that people often make resolutions about is getting into shape. “To get into shape” (shape) means that you are going to do some exercise so that your body is as good physically as it can be. So that yo u can breathe easily when you run, that your muscles are strong – this is all par t of “getting into shape.” And people, for example, who run a marathon – a “marath on” (marathon) is a long race that you run and people talk about getting int o shape for a marathon or getting into shape just in general – which is a goo d idea, of course, you should try to get into shape, whatever shape you are.

People “vow” to go to the health club to work out e very day. The interesting word here, “vow,” (vow) means to promise – usually it me ans to make a very serious promise. “I vow to find the person that took my pen  this morning.” I’m making a serious promise. We often use this word in a religi ous context. For example, the nun – the religious nun – “took her vows” – meaning  her promises. So, it can be a very serious thing to take a vow. It’s also like –sort of like – taking an oath. An “oath” (oath) is a promise that you are going to do  something, or sometimes, simply that you are telling the truth.

A “health club” – two words – is the same as a gym or gymnasium. It’s usually a private company that has treadmills and weight mach ines – things you can do to exercise and there are lots of health clubs in the United States. Here in Los Angeles, many people like to make sure that their b odies look good because their, well, for a lot of reasons I suppose. So, th ere are lots of health clubs. There’s a health club just – two or three of them –  within a couple of miles where I live. So, I used to be a member of a health club that’s over in a park called “Marina Del Rey” which is close to me, but now, I h ave a treadmill at my own house, and so, I just run on that listening to podc asts, of course. Well, people vow to go to the health club and “work out.” And to  “work out” – the verb “to work out” – two words – means to exercise, to do exercis es.

People also want to “go on a diet,” meaning they wa nt to lose weight and one reason they want to lose weight is because they hav e gained weight by “overindulging” at holiday meals. “To indulge” (ind ulge) means to enjoy something. And to “overindulge” means to enjoy some thing too much. And usually, that is food – you overindulge, you eat to o much food. This morning, I went to dim sum which is a Chinese breakfast and I ate too much. I “overindulged.” It was good though. But it was too much. People feel a need then

to “cut back and shed some extra pounds.” “To cut b ack” – two words – the verb here means to reduce, to make less. And you can use  it about food – I’m going to cut back on the number of chocolate chip cookies I eat every day, or you can use it for money – “I’m going to make cut backs.” “I’m going to cut back my expenses.” “I’m not going to spend as much.” It’s a lso used as a noun – “cut backs.” “The company made “cut backs” – it means th ey reduced their spending, their expenses.

“To shed some extra pounds” – “to shed” (shed) mean s to lose here – “to lose some extra pounds,” meaning weight, of course. “I’m  going to lose weight.” Another expression we use is “to drop some pounds” (drop) – “to drop some pounds” – same thing, to lose weight. And of course , people want to lose weight so they are more healthy – to be more healthy you can also say, “healthier” – “healthier” (healthier).

Many people promise to quit smoking or drinking to live healthier lives. Well, of course, quitting smoking is probably a good idea if  you are concerned about your health. Drinking, of course, you don’t want to drin k too much. A little bit might be okay. Doctors say, I think, that if you drink just a little bit every day, it can help your heart, but I may be wrong about that so, don’t  overindulge in your drinking either.

Well, now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at  a native rate of speech. > This is the time of year when people make their New  Year's resolutions. At the beginning of a new year, people take stock of their  lives and decide to make some changes.
> A lot of people want to get into shape. They vow to  go to the health club and work out every day. Many people also decide to go o n a diet. After overindulging at holiday meals, people feel the need to cut back and to shed some extra pounds. Many people also promise to quit smoking or  drinking to live healthier lives.
> Whatever resolution you make, don't forget the most  important one: Promise not to have to make the same resolution next year.

# Holiday Travel

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 116: Holiday Travel.

You’re listening English as a Second Language Podca st episode 116. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

The topic of today’s podcast is going to be travell ing, and specifically, travelling for the holidays. Let’s go! > It's hard to avoid traveling over the holidays, but  the experience I had last week really takes the cake.
> I flew back to Tucson, Arizona to be with my wife's  family, as we do every Christmas. I got to the airport an hour and a half before my flight, which I thought would be plenty of time. When I got there, though, I saw that the security line was out the door. Because it was the holidays, people w ere traveling with a lot of extra packages. It took twice as long as it normall y would to get to the front of the line. When I finally got to the gate, I found out t hat my flight had been oversold. The gate agent was looking for people to voluntaril y give up their seats for a later flight in exchange for a $100 travel voucher. If sh e didn't get enough volunteers, she would have to bump people from the flight. Luck ily, several people took her up on the offer and the rest of us boarded.
> What a hassle! I love the holidays, but I don't lov e holiday travel.

We’re talking today about travelling, and specifica lly, about flying in an airplane. The title of our podcast is “Holiday Travel.” “Holi day” (holiday) means something different in the United States than in Great Britai n. In American English, a “holiday” is usually an official day that the gover nment says you don’t have to work. So, that would be a day like Independence Day , the 4th of July, or Christmas, or New Year’s Day – these are all offici al holidays. In Great Britain, a “holiday” is a vacation – what we would call in the  United States, a “vacation” – where you go away somewhere with your family for tw o weeks. Now, you can

take a vacation in addition to your holiday, but in  the United States, “holiday” doesn’t mean a vacation necessarily. It just means a day that you don’t have to work. Now, in December we have the Christmas holida y. There are some who celebrate Hanukkah in the Jewish calendar and there  are, of course, New Year’s Day celebrations. So, the “holidays” – when someone  uses that plural, at least in the United States, they mean the Christmas, Hanukka h, New Years – that whole time is called the holidays. In fact, some people e ven include Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving Day, at the end of November as the beg inning of the holidays.

Well, we are talking about holiday travelling and w e begin by saying that “it’s hard to avoid travelling over the holidays.” “It’s hard to avoid” means, of course, it’s difficult not to do something. And with that partic ular expression – “it’s hard to avoid” – the verb that comes after is in the “ing” form. So, “it’s hard to avoid travelling.” “It’s hard to avoid talking to my sist er.” “It’s hard to avoid paying your taxes.” “It’s very hard to avoid  dying.” So, these  are all things that take the “ing” – verbs that take the “ing.”

I also said that the experience, what happened to m e last week, really “takes the cake.” The expression “to take the cake” (cake) – “ to take the cake” means that it was the worst possible, or it was in addition to al l of the other problems. It was even more of a problem. Something that is the worst  example of an experience would really take the cake. I go to the dentist and  I have to get my teeth fixed. I have to have a work done on my teeth and when I am finished, the bill is a thousand dollars. So in addition to having pain of going to the dentist, I have the pain of paying a thousand dollars – “that really ta kes the cake” means it’s even worse than other problems.

I flew back to Tucson. And Tucson is a small city i n Arizona, which is next to California. Tucson is in the middle of the desert. Arizona is a desert state. And I was going to go back to be with my wife and her fam ily as we do, as we always do, every Christmas. And I got to the airport early , an hour and a half before my flight, which I thought would be “plenty of time.” “Plenty” (plenty) means a lot, more than enough, so, “plenty of time.” When I got there though, the “security line was out the door.” The “security” (security) l ine” is the line that you have to stand in – to be in – so that you can go through the X-ray machine and make sure you don’t have any weapons or any bombs or any thing else. Well, the line was “out the door.” When we say something is “out t he door” we mean that people are standing outside of the building – the l ine is so long it goes from inside all the way outside to the building. And at Los Angeles International Airport, there are actually eight terminals – eight  places where planes can pull up – eight different parts of the airport, and usually , during the holidays, the security line is out the door in many of those terminals – m any of those areas.

 Well, one of the reasons that it was taking so long  to get through security – “to get through,” meaning to pass through security – wa s people had a lot of “packages.” “Packages” (packages) here means boxes,  things that are gifts for other people. Usually in the holidays, that’s what the packages are. Well, it took “twice as long” as it would, normally, to get to the front of the line. “Twice as long” – three words – “twice,” meaning, of course, two. S o, “twice as long” means two times the amount of time it would normally take to get to the front or the beginning of the line. When I got to the “gate” – t he (gate) – the “gate” is – in the airport, that’s the door where you go out to get in to the airplane. So, you go to the “gate” – that area – and I found out that my flight  had been “oversold.”

“Oversold” is all one word – “over” and “sold” – (o versold). “Oversold” means that the airplane company, the airline as we would call it, has sold too many tickets and this is something that happens in the United St ates. I don’t know about other countries. The airline thinks that it can sell more  tickets than it has seats because people are always cancelling or changing their flig hts. So, they’re guessing, they’re betting that you will – some people will no t come to the flight. So, they have a hundred seats but they sell, for example, 11 0 seats. So, if all 110 people actually get on that flight or try to fly that flig ht, then they have oversold. And when they oversold, the gate agent – and the “agent ” (agent) – is the person who works for the airplane, airline – the person workin g there at the gate has to ask people if they would give up their seats. “To give up your seat” means that you will volunteer. You will say, “Okay, I won’t go on this flight.” And usually, they give you something if you do that. They give you somethi ng in exchange for your seat. The expression “in exchange for” means you give me something, I give you something. “In exchange for $10, I give you, you gi ve me your car” – that’s not a very good deal. “In exchange for a hundred dollar t ravel voucher” – and a “travel voucher” – a “voucher” is (voucher) - a “voucher” i s like a – it’s kind of like a coupon or a certificate. It’s a piece of paper that  says you have a hundred dollars. It’s not a hundred dollar bill, it’s not a  hundred dollars, but it’s worth a hundred dollars. And we use that term “voucher” for  travel – tickets that the airline gives you if you give up your seat.

Well, if you don’t have enough people giving up the ir seat then the airplane – the airline – has to “bump people.” “To bump someone fr om a flight” –“bump” (bump) – means to say you can’t go. And the airplane – air line – has the right, legally, to bump people if they sell too many tickets, which su rprises people when it happens. It has happened to me. I was flying once f rom St. Paul, Minnesota to, I think it was Dallas, Texas and I was “bumped from m y flight,” meaning I was told you can’t go on this flight. We have too many peopl e. Well, luckily, several people “took up” the gate agent’s offer – “they too k her up on the offer.” “To take

someone up on an offer” means that you accept whate ver deal, whatever idea that they present to you. So, someone says, “Why do n’t we go to the beach this afternoon because it’s a beautiful day here in beau tiful Los Angeles and I’ll buy you lunch.” And she says, “Oh, okay, I’ll take you up on your offer” – means I agree to do that. Well, after other people took up the gate agent’s offer for travel vouchers, the rest of us “boarded.” And “to board,”  means just to get on to the airplane. I end the story by saying, “What a hassle .” “What a hassle” (hassle) – “What a hassle” means what a pain, what a problem. Something that causes a lot of problems is a hassle.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech.  > It's hard to avoid traveling over the holidays, but  the experience I had last week really takes the cake.
> I flew back to Tucson, Arizona to be with my wife's  family, as we do every Christmas. I got to the airport an hour and a half before my flight, which I thought would be plenty of time.

If sh e didn't get enough volunteers, she would have to bump people from the flight. Luck ily, several people took her up on the offer and the rest of us boarded.

# Impressions of LA

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 117: Impressions of L.A.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 117. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today we are talking about the general American imp ression of the city of Los Angeles, especially compared to New York City. Let’ s get started!

[start of dialogue]

I was talking to my new friend Nicole about the dif ferences between New York City and Los Angeles. Nicole just relocated from Ne w York, where she lived all her life, and I'm a native of L.A.

Dan: So, is L.A. all it's cracked up to be?

Nicole: Well, the stereotype in the movies is that L.A. is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people. I guess, in the back of my mind, t hat's what I expected.

Dan: And, is it what you found?

Nicole: Well, it is and it's not. The city of L.A. is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected. There are people here from all  over the country and all over world, like New York. I've heard people say that in  L.A., everyone is from somewhere else. That's partly true. So, I've met al l kinds of people here. What I'm realizing is that the picture of L.A. that's in  movies only represents a small segment of the city.

Dan: You're right. Life isn't always like the movie s.

[end of dialogue]

We’re talking today about the city of Los Angeles, where I live, and the impression or the ideas that people have about Los Angeles, especially those who moved from another city – big cities like New Y ork or other cities on the other side of the United States, on the East Coast.  I live here on the West Coast of the U.S and the story begins with the person, the narrator, saying that she was

talking or he was talking to his friend about the d ifferences between New York and Los Angeles. His friend has just relocated from  New York. “To relocate” (relocate) – past tense “relocated” – is to move, t o move permanently here where you’re living from one place to another – usually f rom one city or one state to another. Often, it’s because of a job. So, the comp any you work for asks you to move from Chicago to Dallas – that would be “reloca ting” you.

Well, she had lived or rather been relocated from N ew York – New York City – where she lived all her life – that is all of her l ife – her entire life. And in the story, the narrator is a “native” of Los Angeles or L.A. A  “native” (native) – someone who was born there, someone who is from there origi nally. So the dialogue begins by Dan saying, “So, is L.A. all it’s cracked  up to be?” The expression “cracked up to be” – “cracked (cracked) up to be” –  the verb “to be” – “cracked up to be” here means is it as good as you were expecti ng or as people say it is. So, for example, if you go to a famous museum, say the British Museum in London or any of the beautiful museums in other cities and so meone says, “Well, is it all it’s cracked up to be? – meaning is it as good as people  say it is – and that’s the expression. We sometimes use this in the negative. “It’s not all it’s cracked up to be” – it’s not as good as people say it is. “To cra ck” normally means to break or to separate something – two pieces – into something  rather something into two pieces. But here “cracked up” means is it as good a s people think it is.

Well, Nicole says that the “stereotype” in the movi es about Los Angeles is that it’s a “frivolous” town. The “stereotype” – all one  word – (stereotype) – a “stereotype” is common perception, a common idea th at people have that is often false. So, for example, if you were to say, “Everyo ne from New York City is loud and talks very fast and is rude, is not very nice” – those are all “stereotypes” of people who live in New York City. And there are ste reotypes in every country about people in different regions, about people of different languages, about people with different backgrounds and so forth. Man y of these, of course, are negative stereotypes.

The stereotype about L.A – and it’s usually a negat ive thing- a stereotype – is that it’s “frivolous.” And “frivolous” (frivolous) – when we say something is “frivolous,” we mean not serious. The opposite of i mportant or of serious, something that’s just very light, not important, wo uld be frivolous.

The other stereotype about people in Los Angeles is  that they are “flaky.” “To be flaky” means to be unreliable – means that you’ll s ay one thing and then you’ll do something else. Usually, we talk about people being  “flaky” (flaky) – “flaky” – when they promise to do something, they promise to meet you, for example, at a café and – at the English Café – and they don’t arr ive, they don’t show up, they

don’t come to the café when they said they would – that would be someone who is flaky – the adjective. Or as a noun, we could sa y, “This person is a flake” (flake). “Don’t be a flake,” means keep your promis es. If you say you are going to meet someone, then you should go and be there.

Well, one of the stereotypes about L.A is that peop le here are “flaky.” And Nicole, who’s from New York, says that “in the back of my m ind” that’s what I expected. “In the back of my mind” – that expression means th at you have thought about it, that you have it in your memory, but you weren’t th inking about it actively. You weren’t – it’s something that you may have forgotte n or could only remember a little bit about. Another use of this expression or  another example of this expression would be “I was talking to my friend and  he was telling me about his mother. And in the back of my mind, I was thinking this is the fourth time he has complained to me about his mother,” meaning I start  to remember something that I might have forgotten – “in the back of my mind.”

Well, Nicole says that L.A isn’t exactly what she e xpected. She says that L.A is bigger and “more diverse” or “diverse” than she had  expected. “To be diverse” or “diverse” means – (diverse) – it’s spelled – it mea ns to have a lot of variety. And usually, when we talk about diversity – when someth ing is diverse – we’re talking about people from different backgrounds, from diffe rent, perhaps parts of the country or parts of the world. And here in Los Ange les, Nicole says, we have people from all over the world – just like in New Y ork City. Nicole says that everyone in L.A is from somewhere else and that’s t rue. They’re usually from somewhere else in the world or somewhere else in the United States. People like me, for example. In Los Angeles, I’m sure the major ity of the people who live here now, were not born here. And that is not true in other cities in the United States. Where I’m from, St. Paul, Minnesota, the ca pital of Minnesota. Most of the people you meet will be – have been born in tha t area. So, the smaller towns, the smaller cities tend to be – we would probably c all them more “stable” (stable) – means they don’t change very much – their populat ion. The people don’t move in and out. But in Los Angeles – has a very diverse  and mixed population from all over.

Nicole uses the expression “that’s partly true.” Wh en someone says, it’s “partly (partly) true” or it’s partly false, they mean it’s  sort of – not completely. “Partly” is not completely, not totally. So, “it’s partly true”  means there’s some truth, but it’s not all true.

She says that she’s met all kinds of people here. W hen you say “all kinds” you mean “many different types of people.” And she ends  by saying that her “picture of L.A” – the picture that’s in the movies only rep resents a small segment of the

city. When we use the expression “the picture” – “T he picture you get is that people are flaky” – you mean the impression, the id ea that you get. We sometimes refer to movies as pictures but here, eve n though we’re talking about a movie, the expression “the picture” – that noun –  the use of that noun here is not necessarily related to the movie. You can say, for example, “The picture that you get of London by reading Charles Dickens” – fam ous English author – “is a very dark and depressing one.” So, you can get a pi cture, an idea, of something from any sort of source of information – a movie, a  book, a conversation, television show, and so forth.

Well, the picture that Nicole has of L.A is – that she’s seen in the movies, only “represents” – means it only shows you a small segm ent of the city. A “segment” (segment) is a small part of the city.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

I was talking to my new friend Nicole about the dif ferences between New York City and Los Angeles. Nicole just relocated from Ne w York, where she lived all her life, and I'm a native of L.A.

Dan: So, is L.A. all it's cracked up to be?

Nicole: Well, the stereotype in the movies is that L.A. is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people. I guess, in the back of my mind, t hat's what I expected.

Dan: And, is it what you found?

Nicole: Well, it is and it's not. The city of L.A. is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected. There are people here from all  over the country and all over world, like New York. I've heard people say that in  L.A., everyone is from somewhere else. That's partly true. So, I've met al l kinds of people here.

# Small Talk at a Business Lunch

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 118: Small Talk at a Business Lunch.

Welcome back to English as a Second Language Podcas t episode 118. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is going to be about talking to som eone, a business person, but in an informal way – what we would call “small talk ” or talking about unimportant things as part of an informal or social meeting. Le t’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

James: Hello, are you Muriel Douglas?

Muriel: Yes, and you must be James. It's nice to me et you at long last.

James: Yes, you too. Thanks for agreeing to meet wi th us about the new account. My associate, Susan Kim, should be here an y minute. Would you like something to drink while we're waiting?

Muriel: No, thanks. I'm fine. Did you have a nice h oliday?

James: Yes, I did. My family and I went to Tahoe to  ski and the weather was great. How about you?

Muriel: I stayed in L.A. and it was sunny the entir e weekend. We spent most of the time at home, but we did go see King Kong on Ch ristmas day.

James: How did you like it?

Muriel: It was better than I expected. But, you kno w, I think I would have enjoyed skiing in Tahoe even better. Do you go there often?

James: No, not much. My wife doesn't like to ski. S he prefers vacationing where it's warmer, like Hawaii.

Muriel: I don't blame her. I really enjoyed it ther e when we went a few years ago. I'd like to go back sometime soon.

James: Yes, me too. Oh, here's Susan now. Let me in troduce you.

[end of dialogue]

We’re talking about small talk and in this dialogue , we began by one of the people, James, saying to a woman, “Hello, are you M uriel Douglas?” He obviously doesn’t know her and doesn’t know what sh e looks like, so he asked “Are you Muriel Douglas?” and she says, “Yes, you m ust be James.” The expression “you must be” is used when you don’t kno w someone. You don’t know what they look like, but the situation, the ci rcumstances, tell you that that person is probably the one you are looking for. So,  we use that expression especially when we’re meeting someone new and we do n’t know what they look like. But it’s obvious from the situation that they  are that person.

Well, Muriel says, “It’s nice to meet you” to James . “It’s nice to meet you at long last.” “At long last,” (last) means after such a lo ng time – after a very long time. So perhaps, here, they talked on the phone for many  weeks and at long last, they met each other in this meeting. James says that he thanks Muriel for meeting with him and says that his “associate,” Susan Kim, should be here any minute. An “associate” (associate) is someone that you work  with. So, someone else in your company or your organization is your associate . And the expression “should be here any minute” is what we would say when you a re waiting for someone at a meeting who isn’t there yet, but you expect that they will be there very soon. So, that’s what James is saying. “She should be her e any minute,” meaning very short time.

Muriel asked if James had a nice holiday. “Did you have a nice holiday?” – meaning did you have a good time in your holiday, s uch as Christmas or New Year’s or Hanukkah. James says he did, that he went  to “Tahoe” to ski. “Tahoe” (Tahoe) is a famous skiing place here in California  – in northern California. And then he says to her, “How about you?” – meaning did  you have a good holiday. “How about you?” – that’s an expression you can use  after someone asks about what you did, then you would say “Well, how about y ou?” – tell me about what you did.

Well, Muriel says she stayed home and they watched King Kong on Christmas day –they went to a movie. And James asks, “How did  you like it?” Again, we’re talking here about informal conversation, and so, n otice the topics that they are talking about – vacations, movies – those are good topics that Americans will talk

about with someone that they don’t know very well. They won’t talk about religion, or politics or anything controversial – a nything that may cause problems. So, James asks Muriel, “How did you like it?” – mea ning how did you like the movie, did you like it. Tell me your opinion, how d id you like it. So, if you’re asking someone – you see someone reading a book and  you want to know if they like it and why, you would say, “How did you l ike it?” or “How do you like it?” if they’re still reading it. Muriel says, “It was b etter than I expected.” “It was better than I expected,” meaning before the movie, I didn’ t think it would be very good, but after I saw the movie, then I thought, “Oh, it’ s better than I thought it was going to be.”

She says, “but you know, I think I would have enjoy ed skiing in Tahoe even better,” meaning she would rather have gone skiing.  Notice the very common use of the word “you know.” “You know” is a conversatio n filler – we would say, in English – (filler). We use that expression “you kno w” a lot. Young people sometimes use it too much. But it’s often used when  there’s a pause in the conversation. And you want to fill it with somethin g or you want to make sure that the person is listening to you. And so, when you say “you know” it gets their attention. And that’s another use of “you know.” An d here in the dialogue, Muriel says, “But you know, I think I would’ve enjoyed ski ing in Tahoe,” meaning now that I think about it – “you know,” meaning she’s c onsidering it. She’s thinking about it even more.

Well, James says, or rather, is asked by Muriel, “D o you go to Tahoe often?” and James says, “Not much,” meaning no, he doesn’t go v ery much. He prefers to go to Hawaii. And Muriel says – Hawaii, of course, is the beautiful island. It’s also pronounced, more commonly here in the United States  – “Hawaii” – “Hawaii.” But in the island of “Hawaii,” they pronounce the “W” –  Hawaii is spelled (Hawaii) – in the island itself, the people who live there call i t “Havaii,” where the “W” becomes like a “V.” James tells Muriel that his wife prefer s to go to a warm place like Hawaii and Muriel says, “I don’t blame her.” “I don ’t blame her” means I understand. I agree with her. I would do the same, the same thing. “To blame someone” (blame) means to say that they are wrong, to say that they have made a mistake. But here, she’s agreeing with James’ wif e – “I don’t blame her,” meaning I agree with her. Finally, at the end of the conversation, Susan, his associate arrives and they stop with their small ta lk. Because now, all three of the people are there for the meeting. Now they can go i nto their regular meeting and he says at the end – James says at the end of the d ialogue, “Let me introduce you,” meaning let me introduce you to Susan Kim.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

James: Hello, are you Muriel Douglas?

Muriel: Yes, and you must be James. It's nice to me et you at long last.

James: Yes, you too. Thanks for agreeing to meet wi th us about the new account. My associate, Susan Kim, should be here an y minute. Would you like something to drink while we're waiting?

Muriel: No, thanks. I'm fine. Did you have a nice h oliday?

James: Yes, I did. My family and I went to Tahoe to  ski and the weather was great. How about you?

Muriel: I stayed in L.A. and it was sunny the entir e weekend. We spent most of the time at home, but we did go see King Kong on Ch ristmas day.

# Bad Pickup Lines

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 119: Bad Pickup Lines.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast epi sode 119. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the beautifu l city of Los Angeles, in the state of California.

Today’s podcast is called “Bad Pickup Lines.” And a  pickup line is something that a man says to a woman when he’s trying to ask her o ut on a date, to show he’s romantically interested. Let’s get started! > My friend and I were at a restaurant waiting for ou r dates to arrive. We sat at the bar and tried to get the bartender's attention to o rder a couple of drinks.
> My friend, Tanya, is very pretty. She is always bei ng hit on by men. So, it was no surprise that five minutes after we sat down, a guy  got up from the other side of the bar and walked over to us. He sat down next to Tanya.
> He looked at both of us and said, "Hi, I saw you tw o beautiful ladies sitting by yourselves over here. Could I buy you two a drink?"
> Tanya looked at me and rolled her eyes and said, "N o, thanks. We're waiting for our boyfriends."
> We both thought that he would take the hint and get  lost, but he didn't.
> Instead, he looked at Tanya and said, "Do you come here often?"
> Tanya tried to ignore him, but he wouldn't give up.
> He said, "You look like an angel. Does heaven know you've escaped?"
> That pickup line was so lame that we almost burst o ut laughing. Luckily, we didn't need to keep a straight face for long. Our dates wa lked in and the guy left. Charlie, my date, apologized for keeping us waiting . I told him that it was no big deal. We had plenty of entertainment.
> Well, today we talk about a social event common in the whole world, about men who are interested in women. And this particular po dcast is one from a woman’s perspective – from a woman’s “point of view,” we wo uld say. “Point of view” being her view of it, her side of it. And in this podcast , it opens by the woman saying that “My friend and I were at a restaurant, waiting  for our dates to arrive.” “Our dates” (dates) are the – in this case, the men that  they are going out with – usually, their boyfriend. So, a “date” is someone t hat – either a boyfriend or a girlfriend. The two women sat at the bar. “To sit a t the bar” means that you are sitting in one of the seats right next to the place  where they serve alcohol, beer, wine and so forth. “To sit at the bar” is the expre ssion. Usually those chairs are called “stools” (stools). A “stool” is a type of ch air – usually a very tall chair. Anyway, they were sitting at the bar, and they trie d “to get the bartender’s attention.” “To get someone’s attention” means that  you try to get them to notice you. A “bartender” – all one word – (bartender) – i s someone who serves, who makes and serves drinks at a bar.

One of the women, named Tanya, is very pretty. And she is always being “hit on” by men. “To be hit on” – two words – (hit) (on) – “ to be hit on” – it means that men come up to her and ask her out on a date to sho w their romantic interest – this is “to be hit on.” And, of course, a man can h it on a woman – and that’s the expression – or a woman can hit on a man, when you are showing that you are interested in them romantically – that can be by sm iling or  the way you use your body, and, of course, what you say. But you know th at already.

Well, it was “no surprise” that five minutes after they sat down, someone came over to the two women. “It was no surprise” is an e xpression we use when we mean it was expected. We knew this was going to hap pen. It was no surprise that this man came over and sat next to Tanya. And he said to them, “I saw you two beautiful ladies sitting by yourselves. Could I  buy you a drink?” Well, there are two very common English phrases here that men u se in trying to approach, in trying to talk to women that they do not know – to strangers. “You two beautiful ladies sitting here by yourselves,” meaning you’re not with another man – is what he’s saying. And it’s very common in the United Sta tes, and probably, in many countries to – a man, to buy a woman a drink and th is is also the way of indicating that he is romantically interested. “Cou ld I buy you two – you two women – a drink?”

Well, Tanya looked at her friend and “rolled her ey es.” “To roll (roll) your eyes” means that you look up and look around – usually lo oking up, showing that you think that this person is not very intelligent or t hat you don’t believe something or

that you disagree with someone – those are all time s where you would roll your eyes. Well, she’s, Tanya, is rolling her eyes becau se the man’s pickup line – remember “pickup line” is the sentence or the phrase that a man uses to show a woman he’s interested – “Could I buy you a drink?” – is a very old and not very original line.

Well, Tanya says, “No, thanks” and that they were w aiting for their boyfriends. Unfortunately, the man “did not take the hint.” “To  take the hint” means to understand what the other person is saying. Usually , the other person isn’t being direct, or is trying to give them the message in a very nice, indirect, polite way. And sometimes, this doesn’t always work. People don ’t quite understand. And this is what this man in the story – “he doesn’t ta ke the hint.” He doesn’t understand that the woman is not interested in him.  He doesn’t get lost. “To get lost” here means – informal expression – it means t o leave. But it usually means that the other person doesn’t want you there. So, i f you say to someone “Get lost,” what you’re saying is I want you to leave ri ght away. I don’t like you.

Well, this man doesn’t get lost. Instead, he says t o Tanya, “Do you come here often?” – meaning do you come to this bar a lot. We ll, again, this is a very old and well known pickup line in English in the United  States. “Do you come here often?” – it’s so bad, it’s not something that any woman would be very receptive – not something that a woman would want to hear bec ause it’s almost a joke to say that to someone because it is so old and so uno riginal, so not original. But this man says it anyway, “Do you come here often?” And Tanya tries to ignore him – pretend he’s not there. But he wouldn’t “give  up.” “To give up” – two words – is to stop, to stop doing something. I tried, for  example, to learn how to play the recorder – the musical instrument – the recorder, b ut it was too hard so I gave up. I stopped trying.

Well, this man doesn’t give up. Instead, he uses an other very bad pickup line. He says to the woman, “You look like an angel. Does he aven know you’ve escaped?” Well, the first part of that expression “ You look like an angel” – an “angel” here, of course, is somebody from heaven, s omeone who is supposed to be, here, very beautiful. So, someone says, “You lo ok like an angel” they mean you look very pretty. You look very beautiful. And then he says, “Does heaven know you’ve escaped?” Well, angels are supposed to live in heaven, right? The angels live in heaven and since she is so beautiful , she must be an angel, and so he asked, “Does heaven know that you’ve escaped,” m eaning you’ve got out of heaven and now you are here at this bar. Well, the women think that that pickup line was “very lame.” They say, “It was so lame” (l ame) – “to be lame” here – it’s an informal expression – slang expression. It means  to be really bad, to be very weak, to be very unoriginal. When we say something is “lame” we mean it’s bad.

It’s very bad. We often use that in talking about e xcuses. Somebody gives a “lame excuse,” meaning they try to tell you why the y didn’t do something but it isn’t a very good reason. Well, this is a “lame” pi ckup line. In fact, it was so lame that the two women almost “burst out laughing.” “To  burst out” or “bust out laughing” – means to start laughing very hard sudde nly, usually because of something that someone else has said or done.

Well, they said they didn’t need to keep a straight  face for long. “To keep a straight face” (straight) – a straight face means n ot to smile, not to laugh. Usually means not to laugh. So, someone is telling you some thing that you don’t believe and you think is very funny, but you keep a straigh t face – means you don’t laugh because that might bother the other person or that might hurt the other person and so, “to keep a straight face” means to not laug h when you want to laugh. Well, the reason they didn’t need to keep a straigh t face for long – for a long time – or for much longer, is that their dates arrived. One of the dates – the boyfriends – says that he apologized for “keeping them waiting .” “To keep someone waiting” means they arrive somewhere first and you are late.  And you are “keeping them waiting.”

I should say too before I forget that, I said a “da te” is often your boyfriend or girlfriend. Sometimes, you can have a date, someone  you are interested in romantically, but you don’t consider that person yo ur boyfriend or girlfriend yet. So, before you have this more permanent relationshi p with them, you can have a date. So, that’s just a clarification. Well, the wo man at the end of the story tells her date that it was no big deal. The expression “i t’s no big deal” (deal) means it’s not important – not something that you should worry  about.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of story]

My friend and I were at a restaurant waiting for ou r dates to arrive. We sat at the bar and tried to get the bartender's attention to o rder a couple of drinks.

My friend, Tanya, is very pretty. She is always bei ng hit on by men. So, it was no surprise that five minutes after we sat down, a guy  got up from the other side of the bar and walked over to us. He sat down next to Tanya.

He looked at both of us and said, "Hi, I saw you tw o beautiful ladies sitting by yourselves over here. Could I buy you two a drink?"

Tanya looked at me and rolled her eyes and said, "N o, thanks. We're waiting for our boyfriends."

We both thought that he would take the hint and get  lost, but he didn't.

Instead, he looked at Tanya and said, "Do you come here often?"

Tanya tried to ignore him, but he wouldn't give up.

He said, "You look like an angel. Does heaven know you've escaped?"

That pickup line was so lame that we almost burst o ut laughing. Luckily, we didn't need to keep a straight face for long. Our dates wa lked in and the guy left. Charlie, my date, apologized for keeping us waiting . I told him that it was no big deal. We had plenty of entertainment.

Don: So how did your end-of-the-year review go?

Becky: Oh, it was okay. I had my meeting with Mitch  this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiati ve. He thinks that I need to start being more creative.

Don: Did he actually say that?

Becky: Well, not in so many words. But I know that productivity is a big issue for him. Oh, he said the usual things like "Keep up the  good work" and "Thanks for your hard work," but he also said that he's thinkin g about bringing some employees into my department. That, to me, means he 's not satisfied with what I've been doing.

Don: Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said?

Becky: No, I don’t. Either I shape up or my job is on the line.

Don: Well, I think you may be overreacting. Mitch l ikes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he w as doing.

Becky: Do you really think so?

Don: Yes, I do. If you ask around, other people wil l tell you the same thing.

Becky: Maybe you're right. Thanks, Don. I feel bett er.

Don: I'm glad to hear it.

 [end of dialogue]

The title of today’s podcast is called “Employee Pe rformance Review.” An “employee,” of course, is someone who works for a c ompany. “Performance” (performance) is how well or how hard you work. And  a “review” is when the boss sits down with you and talks about how you have don e over the past three months or six months. Here, it is the end of the ye ar – after one year. And in many companies, there is an “Employee Performance R eview” every year where each person has to talk to the boss, their boss, an d say how much they’ve done and how well they have done it.

The dialogue begins with Don asking Becky, “So how did your end of the year review go?” “End of the year” – which is usually or  often hyphenated – it could be just “end of the year.” But “end of the year review ” means, of course, in December or in January, or after one year of workin g for the company – and “review,” we know already, is when you sit down and  you talk about something. You “go over” something, we would say. “To go over”  means to talk about. Becky says it was okay – her end of the year review. She met with her boss, Mitch, and his “bottom line” was that he thinks she needs to s how more “initiative.” The “bottom line” – two words – “bottom (bottom) line ( line)” – the “bottom line” is his final message. The expression or the term “bottom l ine” refers, usually, to the profit that a company makes. They sell so much and it costs them. They spend so much and the bottom line is how much they made o r how much they lost. But here, the expression is used to mean after all sort s of discussion, after everything else is said, what’s the real message – what’s the most important idea. So the bottom line for her boss is that Becky needs to sho w more “initiative.” “Initiative” (initiative) means that you are willing to try new things. And you are willing to do things without anyone telling you to. You start thi ngs on your own. The verb “to initiate” means to begin or to start something new.  So, when her boss tells her she needs to “show” (show) more initiative – and th at’s the verb we usually use – “to show initiative” means she has to demonstrate. She has to actually do things that are new and start things on her own.

The boss also thinks that Becky needs to more “crea tive.” “Creative” (creative) here means she needs to think of new original diffe rent ideas. “To be creative” means that you come up with some intelligent and or iginal solutions to problems or ideas. Don says, “Well, did he actually say that ?” meaning is that what  her boss said to her. And she says, “Well, not in so ma ny words.” The expression “not in so many words” means not exactly. Those wer en’t his exact words, but that was the message. That was the idea that he was  telling me or he was communicating to me. So, someone says, “Well, I ask ed my wife if we could go

to a movie tonight. And she said, “Absolutely not.”  And you ask me, “Well, did she actually say that?” and I say, “Well, not in so  many words, but she turned on the television set and started watching TV.” In oth er words, she gave me the message without actually telling me that. I think s he wants me to wash the dishes and not go to the movies. So, that is telling me, b ut not in so many words.

Becky says that she knows that “productivity is a b ig issue” for her boss. “Productivity” (productivity) – “to be productive” or “productivity” means that you get a lot done. You accomplish a lot in a short amo unt of time. In companies, businesses are always wanting to “increase producti vity,” meaning their employees, their workers, do more and more for the same amount of time, so they get more done.

Well, her boss says what she calls “the usual thing s,” meaning the normal things, to her in her end of the year review. “Keep up the good work.” When you say to someone “keep up the good work,” “to keep up” means  to continue. So, it’s a very common expression, both formally and informal situations. When someone is doing a good job, you want them to continue. You  say, “Keep up the good work.” Her boss says, also, “Thanks for your hard w ork.” Once again, “thanks for” is expressing their appreciation – their thanks.

But Becky says her boss also wants to bring in some  new employees – in other words, to get or “hire” (hire) means someone gets a  new job, you hire someone into their department. She says, “That, to me, mean s he’s not satisfied.” “That, to me,” meaning in my opinion, means he’s not satisfie d. Well, Don says, “Are you sure you’re not reading too much into what he said? ” “To read into something” means that you are trying to interpret. You are try ing to figure out what someone is talking about even if they don’t say that exact thing. “To read too much into something” is to think of something as more serious  than it really is or to interpret or understand something in the wrong way because yo u are thinking about it perhaps too much. So, when my wife sits down to wat ch television and points over at the dishes that I’m supposed to wash, to cl ean – if I thought, “Hmm, I think she wants to divorce me.” “I think she wants to leave me because she wants me to do the dishes” – well, maybe, but that would be “reading too much into her actions or her words.”

Well, Becky says she doesn’t think she’s reading to o much into what her boss said. She said, “Either I shape up or my job is on the line.” “To shape up” – two words – (shape) “up” – means to improve. You say to   somebody “shape up” – means you should do better. There’s a common expres sion “Shape up or ship out.” “To shape up” means to improve. “To ship (shi p) out” means to leave; so, either you improve or you leave. She says that if s he doesn’t shape up, her job is

on the line – three words – “on the line” – means t hat she could be fired. When you say your job is “on the line” it means you may lose your job. It’s possible that you will get fired. You will lose your job at the c ompany.

Don thinks that Becky is “overreacting.” “To overre act” – all one word – means to – “to react” – means somebody does something and yo u do something because of what they did. So, if I try to punch you, if I t ry to hit you. You would react by protecting yourself or hitting me first, perhaps. W ell, “to overreact” means that you do too much. So, I try to hit you and you pull out a gun and you shoot me. Well, that’s overreacting and overreacting also can  happen when somebody says something to you and then you get very angry or you  think something very bad or serious is going to happen.

Mitch, according to Don, Becky’s boss, likes to giv e “constructive criticism.” “Constructive criticism” (constructive) – “construc tive” and “criticism” (criticism) – “criticism” – “constructive criticism” – means that  you are giving someone comments in order to help them, not to punish them,  not to say they are bad but you want them to do better. So, “criticism,” which is something negative, you often say to someone. “Constructive criticism” mean s good criticism – things that will help the person. And Becky’s not sure and Dan says, “Well, if you ask around, other people will say the same thing.” “If you ask around” – “to ask around” means to ask other people, to talk to other  people.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a native rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Don: So how did your end-of-the-year review go?

Becky: Oh, it was okay. I had my meeting with Mitch  this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiati ve. He thinks that I need to start being more creative.

Don: Did he actually say that?

# Cooking Dinner

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 121: Cooking Dinner.

Hello and welcome to episode 121 of English as a Se cond Language Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you fr om the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about me cooking dinner. Let’s g et started! > I'm not a very good cook, but I decided to surprise  my wife by making a three- course meal. I went to the supermarket to get the d essert, and I stopped by the farmer's market to get some fresh vegetables, my in gredients for the salad.
> The meal would start with a salad. I washed the veg etables in the sink, chopped them up, and mixed them in a bowl with a light dres sing. That was pretty easy.
> The next course was going to be more difficult. The  main dish would be salmon. I put the oil and the fish in the pan, but it was dif ficult to know when it was done, not underdone or overcooked.
> The last part of the meal would be the dessert. I d ecided to buy a small chocolate cake. The meal turned out pretty well and my wife e njoyed it. After dinner, we went into the kitchen and saw all of the dirty dish es that needed washing. I realized that cooking isn't the hard part, it's the  cleaning up!

Our story begins with me telling you that I am not a very good cook and that is true; that is not just part of the story. I am not a very good cook, but I decided to surprise my wife. “To surprise someone” is to do so mething they don’t expect. I decided to surprise my wife by making a three-cours e-meal. A “three-course- meal” – “course” (course) means that there are thre e different parts of the meal. The first part is what we call the “appetizer” or t he salad. We have salad first in a meal, or soup. The second course would be what we w ould call the “main course” where you would have, for example, meat or sea food, fish, etc. – that would be the main course. And usually, you’ll have some vegetables and maybe some potatoes or rice or something else. And then t he third course would be the

dessert course where you would have cake or somethi ng sweet. So, that’s a “three-course-meal,” (meal) – of course, is what yo u eat – a meal. This is a dinner meal.

I decided to go to the “supermarket.” And a “superm arket” – all one word – (supermarket) is a big store where you buy lots of different types of food. Some people call it just a “grocery store.” A “grocery s tore” – “grocery” is (grocery) – that is the same thing as a supermarket. “Groceries ” is another word for food. Well, I go to the supermarket to get the dessert, t he third course, and I stopped by the farmer’s market to get some vegetables. “To stop by” – two words – “to stop by” (by) – means that you were going from one place to another and you decided to stop and do something along the way befo re you got there. So, if I’m going to the bank and I also need to go to the libr ary, I may stop by the library first and then go to the bank – means I go there an d then I go somewhere else.

Well, I stopped by the “farmer’s market.” “Farmer” (farmer’s) – a “farmer,” of course, is the person who grows food, and in the Un ited States, at least in California, I know, there are lots of farmer’s mark ets and these are usually on one day of the week in a different part of the city . And people who sell food – who make, who grow their own food – come in and they se ll their food directly to people. There is no market, there is just a farmer’ s market. They’re just a group of people together who are selling food. We have – boy, three or four farmer’s markets on different days around where I live and u sually the food is a little fresher, especially the vegetables. It’s mostly veg etables. Things like lettuce and carrots and grapes and those sorts of things you wi ll find in a “farmer’s market.” Well, I went to the farmer’s market to get some veg etables and also, these vegetables were my “ingredients” for the salad. “In gredients” (ingredients) – “ingredients” are the things that you put into food  where the different parts of the food. So, the ingredients, for example, for macaron i and cheese – which is a favorite American food, especially for children – “ macaroni” is a type of pasta. Macaroni and cheese are the two ingredients for “Ma caroni and cheese.” So, an “ingredient” is anything that you put into the food .

Well, the meal would start, I decided, with a salad  – that would be the first course. So, I washed the vegetables in the sink. the “sink” (sink) is where you can run water and the water goes down into a pipe ( pipe) – that’s part of the sink. Well, in the sink I washed the vegetables and I “ch opped them up.” “To chop up” (chop) (up) – two words – “to chop up” means to cut . So, I cut them up in small pieces – that’s usually chopping up – usually means  doing it, cutting it in small pieces. I mixed them in a bowl with a light dressin g. So, I put them together with a light dressing. A “dressing” is something that – a liquid that you put on salad. Usually, it has oil – sometimes oil, and vinegar, d ifferent ingredients go into

dressing. It’s sometimes also called a “salad dress ing” or a “dressing” here is the same thing.

The next meal was going to be the main dish – the m ain course. And “dish” (dish) has two meanings. At least, “dish” can be the physi cal plate that you put something on or the bowl you put something in. A “d ish” also can mean the same as the course or a part of the meal. Well, the main  dish was going to be fish and the fish was “Salmon,” which is spelled (salmon) – in English, salmon. I put oil and the fish into a pan (pan). The “pan” is the met al thing that you put over the fire – over the flame (flame) – that’s the fire und er on the stove. And you heat up the pan and you put the oil and fish.

But I said it was difficult to know when it was don e – not “underdone or overcooked.” When we say the food is “done” (done) we mean it’s cooked just right. It’s cooked correctly. When we say it’s “und erdone” – all one word – “underdone” (underdone) – that means it isn’t cooke d enough. You need to cook it more and “overcooked” – also one word – “overcoo ked” means you’ve cooked it too long. You’ve cooked it too much.

 Well, the last part of the meal was going to be a dessert and I bought a small chocolate cake because, c’mon, I can’t do everythin g, right? So, the last part of the meal was a chocolate cake. And I say that the m eal “turned out” pretty well. “To turn out” means to result – what happens at the  end. You can use that expression and it’s two words – “turn” “out” (turn)  (out) – you can use that expression to talk about anything, how anything end ed or how anything resulted. For example, “How did that movie turn out?” means w hat happens at the end? Here, the meal turned out “pretty well,” meaning the result was pretty good. My wife enjoyed it. Of course, after dinner, we went i nto the kitchen and saw all the dirty dishes – all the plates, cups, the pans, the glasses – all of those were dirty and those are dirty dishes. Remember “dish” has tho se two meanings – here it means the actual plate and spoons and forks etc.

I say at the end that I realized that cooking isn’t  the hard part. It’s the cleaning up. And “to clean (clean) up” is to – really it’s the s ame as to clean. But again, in English, we often add the second word or making som ething – giving something emphasis. So, the “cleaning up” here would be the c leaning of the dishes.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech.

# Packing Toiletries for a Trip

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 122 – Packing Toiletries for a Trip.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 122. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about packing for a trip. Let’s go! > It was going to be my wife's 30th birthday, and I w as surprising her with a trip to San Diego for the weekend. Since it was going to be  a surprise, I needed to pack both of our bags before picking her up from work an d hitting the road.
> Packing my stuff was easy, of course. I knew that t he hotel would have shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion, so I didn't pack any.  I packed my wife’s brush, comb, hair dryer, nail clippers, and emery board. I  made sure that I didn't forget any of her makeup: foundation, mascara, eye shadow,  blush, and lipstick.
> I had everything we needed for our little trip. I w as sure my wife would be surprised, and I know she loves surprises!

Today we’re talking about going on a trip, and befo re going on a trip – going somewhere else – you have to “pack.” “To pack” (pac k) means to put clothing in a bag or in a suitcase. A “suitcase” (suitcase) is a bag in the shape of a box that you put your clothing into to carry it when you’re going on a trip. Some of the things you need to pack are “toiletries.” “Toiletri es” (toiletries) are all the things that you need for your teeth and for your hair and for washing and so forth.

In the story, my wife’s 30th birthday was coming up , and “I was surprising her with a trip to San Diego.” “To surprise” someone me ans to do something unexpected, something they don’t expect. I was goin g to surprise her by taking her on a trip to San Diego. “San Diego” is a city i n California about a hundred miles south of Los Angeles. It takes about two hour s to drive from my house here in Los Angeles to San Diego. San Diego is a popular  place for people in Los Angeles to go for the weekend because it’s a smalle r town and a very nice area.

The trip was going to be a surprise, so “I needed t o pack both of our bags” – my suitcase and her suitcase – before “picking her up from work.” “To pick someone up” means to go to the place where that person is a nd to give him or her a ride in your car – to drive that person somewhere in your c ar. After I picked her up from work, we would be “hitting the road.” “To hit (hit)  the road” means to begin your trip, to start travelling, to start driving. “What time are you going to hit the road tomorrow?” “Well, I have to be at work by eight o’c lock, so I will hit the road at seven thirty.”

I said that “packing my stuff was easy, of course.”  “My stuff” (stuff) here means my things. I knew the hotel would already have “sha mpoo, conditioner, and body lotion.” “Shampoo” (shampoo) is a liquid soap for w ashing your hair. “Conditioner” (conditioner) is what you can put on your hair after you use the shampoo to make your hair softer. I don’t use “cond itioner.” I don’t use shampoo either, because I don’t have any hair. “Body lotion ” is a kind of “lotion” (lotion), which is something you put on your skin to make it soft and smooth. “Body lotion” is for your body, “face lotion” is for your face, a nd so forth.

I had to pack my wife’s things, so I packed her “br ush,” “comb,” and “hair dryer.” Both a “brush” (brush) and a “comb” (comb) are thin gs that women and men can use to arrange their hair, to make their hair neat.  A brush is wide and has many rows of what are called “bristles” that go through your hair. A comb is thin and flat with little pieces of plastic called “teeth” that a lso go through your hair. And a “hair dryer” – two words, (hair) (dryer) – is a lit tle machine that blows hot air. It is like a heater that blows hot air to dry your wet ha ir after you wash it.

I also packed my wife’s “nail clippers” and “emery board.” “Nail (nail) clippers (clippers)” are for trimming or cutting your “nails ,” which are the same as “fingernails.” Fingernails grow at the ends of your  fingers, and “toenails” grow at the ends of your toes. And “to clip” means to cut. So, a “nail clipper” is for cutting your nails. An “emery board” – two words, (emery) ( board) – is used to “file” your nails, or to make the edges of your nails smooth so  there aren’t any rough parts.

(I have to say that I had no idea about many of these things; I had to ask my wife to explain them to me to do today’s episode . Most men don’t, I think, know much about these things.)

Finally, “I made sure that I didn’t forget any of h er makeup.” “Makeup” (makeup) is a general word for all of the things that women and sometimes men put on their faces. I packed my wife’s “foundation,” “masc ara,” and “eye shadow.” “Foundation” (foundation) can either be a powder, w hich is loose and dry, or it can be a liquid, which is wet. Foundation makes you r skin look all the same color

and very smooth-looking, and it is the first step i n putting on makeup – that’s what my wife tells me.

”Mascara” (mascara) is the makeup that you put on y our eyelashes. Your “eyelashes” (eyelashes) are the little hairs that g row out of your eyelids. Your “eyelid” is the skin that covers your eye when you close your eye. So, your eyelashes grow out of your eyelids, and you put mas cara on your eyelashes to make them darker and to make them look longer. And “eye shadow” (shadow) is a powder that you put on your eyelids. Eye shadow c omes in all different colors , I’m told .

I also packed her “blush” and “lipstick.” “Blush” ( blush) is what you put on your cheeks. Your “cheeks” (cheeks) are the part of your  face below your eyes, and some women use blush to make this area look more pi nk or red. And finally, there is “lipstick.” “Lipstick” (lipstick) goes on your lips, which are the parts of your mouth that are pink or red. Lipstick is most often a pink or red color, but it also comes in many other colors, as well.

I now had everything for our trip, and we were read y to go!

Now let’s listen to the story again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of story]

It was going to be my wife's 30th birthday, and I w as surprising her with a trip to San Diego for the weekend. Since it was going to be  a surprise, I needed to pack both of our bags before picking her up from work an d hitting the road.

Packing my stuff was easy, of course. I knew that t he hotel would have shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion, so I didn't pack any.  I packed her brush, comb, hair dryer, nail clippers, and emery board. I made sure that I didn't forget any of her makeup: foundation, mascara, eye shadow, blush, and  lipstick.

I had everything we needed for our little trip. I w as sure my wife would be surprised, and I know she loves surprises!

# Pop and Jazz Music

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 123: Pop and Jazz Music.

Hello and welcome to episode 123 of English as a Se cond Language Podcast. I am your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center f or Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This podcast is going to be about popular music or pop music, as well as jazz. Let’s listen!

[start of dialogue]

Abby: Hey, what are you listening to?

Bill: Right now I'm listening to the Foo Fighters' latest album. There are some really good tracks on this CD, including their new single.

Abby: Let me see your iPod for a minute. It looks l ike you've got a ton of good stuff loaded up. I like Gwen Stefani, too, and what 's this? Shakira? I had no idea you were a fan of hers.

Bill: I think she's a really talented singer and so ngwriter. And, well, she's hot, too.

Abby: Yeah, I bet. Let's see. You've got some great  jazz and blues standards here, too. Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington, and Bill ie Holiday. This one is a live recording, and these are compilations. You've got t heir greatest hits and some bootleg stuff, too. I never knew you were such a ja zz buff.

Bill: Yeah, I like all kinds of music. Now, where a re you going with my iPod?

Abby: I thought I'd just borrow it for a little whi le.

Bill: Yeah, right. Hand it over. I've got to downlo ad my favorite podcast.

[end of dialogue]

Well, today’s podcast is about listening to differe nt types of music and the vocabulary that we use to talk about that. The dial ogue begins with Abby saying, “Hey, what are you listening to?” Notice that this is an informal conversation and

the use of “Hey” (hey) is very common, particularly  among the younger people. “Hey, what are you listening to?” And Bill says, “W ell, right now I’m listening to the Foo Fighter’s latest album.” “The Foo Fighters”  are a popular music group in the United States or used to be anyway. “The latest  album” (album) – an “album” is – can also be called a “record” (record). Now, w e often call it a “CD” – a compact disc – those are all – mean the same thing now. An “album” used to be something that was big and black  and made out of a material called “vinyl.” But now, it’s all digital and we st ill, however, use the term “album.” So, when a group releases – and that’s the verb we use – when they first put out an album, when they first sell an album, we say the y “release” an album. We still use that term.

“There are some good tracks on this CD,” Bill says,  “including their new single.” A “track” on a CD or on an album – (track) – is a son g. So, a song can be called a “track.” A “single” (single) is a song that a popul ar group writes in order to have it played on the radio in order that it will be popula r. And usually, songs or rather albums or CD’s have a number of singles that the mu sician – that the band hopes will become popular and so, they’ll make a vi deo. a music video, for it. And they will send it to the radio stations.

Well, Abby says, “Let me see your iPod for a minute .” That expression “let me see” is very common to mean give it to me so I can look at it. “Let me see” means that you have to actually give the thing to t he person. They don’t mean just hold it. Usually it means to give something to  someone. So, “let me see your pen” means give me your pen so I can look at it or whatever I’m doing. Well, Abby says, “Let me see your iPod for a moment” – for a minute rather. She says, “It looks like you’ve got a ton of good stuff loade d up.” A “ton” (ton) is just an informal expression – informal use here – means a l ot. If you have a lot of something, you can say, “You have a ton” (ton). “To n” (ton) is also a way of measuring weight in English. And a “ton” is the sam e as 2,000 pounds, depending on the kind of ton. There are actually di fferent kinds of tons. But normally we talk about a ton as 2,000 pounds. But h ere it just means a lot – a large number.

So, you have a ton of good stuff or good things loa ded up. “To load up” (load) up your iPod, or your mp3 player, means to put things on it. So if you go to your iPod and you load up some podcasts, so you can list en to them on your drive to work, for example. Well, Abby likes Gwen Stefani wh o is a female rock singer – rather Bill likes Gwen Stefani because it’s Bill’s iPod. And he also likes Shakira. Shakira is a Colombian singer who is very popular i n the United States. She records in Spanish and in English. Well, Abby says,  “I had no idea you were a fan of Shakira.” “I had no idea” means I didn’t kno w. I had absolutely no idea. I

didn’t know that you were a “fan.” A “fan,” of cour se, (fan) – someone who likes a particular group here. Bill says, “I think she’s a really talented singer and songwriter.” A “songwriter” is all one word – (song writer) – is, of course who writes songs and that’s the noun – a “songwriter.” Then Bill says, “And well, she’s hot too.” This is an informal – kind of a slang exp ression. When you say a woman is hot or a man is hot, you mean they’re very beaut iful. And usually, you also mean that they are very sexually attracted – that t hey are very good looking, very pretty, very beautiful. To say something is “hot” n ow has become a common slang term to say, “Oh that’s hot” – means that’s r eally great, that’s wonderful. Mostly a rich American girl, woman, by the name of Paris Hilton, has made that expression very popular, but the expression “She’s hot” or “He’s hot” is actually – goes back several years.

Well, Abby says, after Bill tells her that Shakira is hot, Abby says, “Yeah, I bet.” “I bet” (bet) means I’m sure that’s true. Here it mean s I’m sure that’s true. It actually, when someone says, “Yeah. I bet” – means that yes, I agree. I’m sure that’s true. But there’s also this idea that they d on’t really like the idea that it is true or there’s some negative meaning, some negativ e idea that they are trying to convey. “To convey” (convey) means to tell you. Som etimes, we use that expression “I bet” when you don’t believe someone. Someone says, “I hear it is going to rain tomorrow.” and you say, “Yeah, I bet.” – means you don’t beli eve it’s going to rain tomorrow. So, it can be very confusing. Usually, however, it means that you agree it’s true even though you don’t particularly like the fact th at it is true.

Well, Abby says to Bill, “You’ve got some great jaz z and blues standards here. “Jazz,” (jazz) of course, is a style of music that began in the 20’s and 30’s that was originally very popular among African American or black musicians. “Blues” (blues) is even older and is also – comes from the African American people who were living in the early 20th century. Of course, t here are still jazz and blues players. “Blues” tends to be a little more – usuall y a little sadder type of music. Jazz – there’s lots of different kinds of jazz with  all different sorts of instruments – musical instruments. A “standard” – when we are tal king about a song. A “standard” (standards) – a “standard” is the same a s a classic. It’s a song that was very popular many years ago. And that it was – the fact that it was very popular means that people still listen to it. So, a  jazz standard or a blues standard would be a song from the past that’s still  very popular today.

Bill’s iPod has Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington, those are two jazz artists, and Billy Holiday, who was a blues artist. When we say an “artist” (artist) – just like an artist who paints a picture, you can also be a “rec ording artist,” meaning you make – you’re a singer or a musician who makes albu ms. Abby also says that

Bill has some “Greatest Hits” and some “bootleg stu ff” too. “Greatest Hits” – two words – are the most popular songs of a group and o ften the group after several years, will put out an album. “To put out” means the same as to release an album, to start selling an album. They’ll put out a n album of “Greatest Hits” – their best, most popular songs. “Bootleg” (bootleg) – all  one word – is an illegal recording, usually at a concert where someone recor ds the band and then sells it even though they do not have permission – they’re n ot supposed to. Abby also says that she didn’t know Bill was such a “jazz buf f.” To be a “jazz buff” (buff) means the same as a jazz fan – someone who likes ja zz music.

Well, Abby says that she wants to borrow Bill’s iPo d and Bill says, “Yeah, right.” “Yeah (yeah) right” – when someone says, “Yeah, rig ht” they mean no you can’t or I don’t believe that. “It’s going to rain tomorr ow.” “Yeah, right” means no, it’s not going to rain tomorrow. You don’t think it’s go ing to rain tomorrow. Instead Bill says, “Hand it over.” “Hand (hand) it over” means g ive it back to me. “Hand it over” – it’s kind of a – there’s some negative conn otation. Negative idea behind hand it over. You’re demanding, you’re almost forci ng the person to give it back to you- to give something to you. Someone who is go ing to steal your wallet might say, “Hand it over” because you don’t have a choice. Bill says, “Hand it over.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Abby: Hey, what are you listening to?

Bill: Right now I'm listening to the Foo Fighters' latest album. There are some really good tracks on this CD, including their new single.

Abby: Let me see your iPod for a minute. It looks l ike you've got a ton of good stuff loaded up. I like Gwen Stefani, too, and what 's this? Shakira? I had no idea you were a fan of hers.

Bill: I think she's a really talented singer and so ngwriter. And, well, she's hot, too.

Abby: Yeah, I bet. Let's see. You've got some great  jazz and blues standards here, too. Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington, and Bill ie Holiday. This one is a live recording, and these are compilations. You've got t heir greatest hits and some bootleg stuff, too. I never knew you were such a ja zz buff.

Bill: Yeah, I like all kinds of music. Now, where a re you going with my iPod?

Abby: I thought I'd just borrow it for a little whi le.

Bill: Yeah, right. Hand it over. I've got to downlo ad my favorite podcast.

# Asking for Clarification in a Business Meeting.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 124: Asking for Clarification in a Business Meeting.

Hello, and welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 124. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, and as always, comin g to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, C alifornia.

Today’s podcast is about asking for clarification w hen you don’t understand something at a business meeting. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

I was negotiating a contract with a new business pa rtner, and we had a meeting to clarify the terms.

Bill: If I understand the terms correctly, the leng th of the contract would be one year with a one-year option. Is that correct?

Ms. Samuels: Do you mean the contract for equipment  rental or the one for training?

Bill: I was under the impression that both contract s had the same terms.

Ms. Samuels: Yes and no. Let me see if I can clarif y that. The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a cl ause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months.

Bill: Could you elaborate on that?

Ms. Samuels: Sure. What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in wr iting.

Bill: Let me see if I have that right. This contrac t is for six months of training, but if it isn't cancelled, continues for another six month s. Is that right?

Ms. Samuels: Yes, that's right.

Bill: Okay, that's clear enough. Let's move on to t he other terms

[end of dialogue]

In today’s podcast, we’re talking about asking for clarification or trying to get someone to explain something to us that we don’t un derstand. “To clarify” (clarify) means to explain something you don’t unde rstand. Well, in the dialogue today, the story begins by Bill talking about how h e was negotiating a contract. “To negotiate” (negotiate) means to talk to someone  and try to come to an agreement, try to create an agreement between two p eople. Usually, this is a business term – you negotiate. You can always use t his in politics – two countries can negotiate. Well, here we’re negotiati ng a contract.

A “contract” (contract) is an agreement – a legal a greement between two people or two companies. In this story, the man is trying to negotiate a contract with a new business partner, someone he is going to work w ith. And they had a meeting to clarify the terms. Well, clarify – we already kn ow, to explain something you don’t understand. “Terms” (terms) - in business whe n we talk about the terms, we’re talking about the conditions or the parts of the contract – what the contract or agreement actually says. For example, one term of a contract could be how long the contract will last – one year, six months,  and so forth. Another term of the contract or part of the contract could be how m uch you are going to spend – how much money you are going to spend. So, those are all terms of a contract.

Well, Bill begins the conversation by saying, “If I  understand the terms correctly.” This is an expression that we would use before summ arizing or giving our interpretation or understanding of something. For e xample, someone is explaining a contract to you or someone is explaini ng anything to you. And you want to make sure that you understood. You want to check with that person. You say, “If I understand you correctly.” And here Bill  says, “If I understand the terms of the contract correctly.” He goes on then to give  his understanding – “The length of the contract would be one year with a one  year option.” An “option” (option) in a business contract means that you have  a possibility for continuing the contract for a longer time. And once the contra ct is over, you can continue it for more time.

Bill then says, “Is that correct?” – which is a way  of asking am I correct, do I understand correctly, is that correct. And Ms. Samu els says, “Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for traini ng?” “Do you mean” is a way you ask people to tell you more information – to ge t more information. You’re not quite sure what they don’t understand. You don’t un derstand what they don’t understand. So, you say, “Did you mean,” or “Do you  mean this or that?” “Training” (training) is sort of like classes for e mployees, for people who work for a company, it’s education – it’s giving them some m ore information about

something. So, you can go to a training to learn ho w to use the Macintosh PowerBook G4, for example – that’s my computer. I c ould go to a training about that – a class about that.

Bill then says, “I was under the impression that bo th contracts had the same terms.” “I was under the impression” (impression) –  when you say to someone, “I was under the impression,” you mean that is how I u nderstood it. “My understanding of this was,” and then you give your understanding. “I was under the impression that this girl loved me, but it turn s out she did not love me at all.” How sad huh? “I was under the impression that” – I understood, that’s what I understood.

Well, Ms Samuels says, “Let me see if I can clarify  that.” When somebody says, “Let me see if I can,” they mean give me the opport unity, allow me, let me do something. Here, it’s “Let me see if I can clarify”  – make it clear for you. And she says, “The terms of the contracts are the same” – t he two contracts or equipment rental – renting equipment and training. But that t he contract for training has a “clause” that allows for the cancellation after the  first six months. A “clause” is a part of the contract. It’s usually a sentence or tw o sentences or some part of the contract that is very – has a specific terms. A “cl ause” is one of the terms. But usually, it has to do – often has to do with an exc eption or something that’s different about the contract. So, the clause here a llows for or means that you can have a cancellation. And “to cancel,” of course mea ns to end something. So, a “cancellation” is an ending. So, what they’re sayin g here is that for one contract, they can end the contract after only six months.

Bill then asks Ms. Samuels to give him more informa tion. And one way to do that is to say, “Could you elaborate on that?” “Could yo u elaborate?” “To elaborate” (elaborate) means to give more detail, to give more  information, to elaborate. And Ms. Samuels says, “Sure” – yes. “What I mean is  that either side or either side – either pronunciation is correct – that eithe r side could cancel the training contract after six months as long as it’s in writin g.” “What I mean is” is another way of introducing an explanation. When someone doe sn’t understand you and you can say, “Well, what I mean is,” and then you t ry to explain it in a different way. In this case, the contract can be cancelled if  it is “in writing.” And when we say, “I want it in writing,” we mean I want it writ ten down on a piece of paper.

Bill says, “Let me see if I have that right.” This is another way of saying to the other person, “Okay, let me see if I understand you  correctly. Let me see. I’m going to tell you again what I think the situation is.” So, “Let me see if I have that right or correct.” And then he explains his underst anding of the contract – the contract is for six months of training but if it is n’t cancelled, continues for another

six months. “Is that right?” – meaning “Is that cor rect?” And Ms. Samuels says, “Yes, that’s right.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

I was negotiating a contract with a new business pa rtner, and we had a meeting to clarify the terms.

Bill: If I understand the terms correctly, the leng th of the contract would be one year with a one-year option. Is that correct?

Ms. Samuels: Do you mean the contract for equipment  rental or the one for training?

Bill: I  was under the impression that both contrac ts had the same terms.

Ms. Samuels: Yes and no. Let me see if I can clarif y that. The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a cl ause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months.

Bill: Could you elaborate on that?

Ms. Samuels: Sure. What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in wr iting.

Bill: Let me see if I have that right. This contrac t is for six months of training, but if it isn't cancelled, continues for another six month s. Is that right?

Ms. Samuels: Yes, that's right.

Bill: Okay, that's clear enough. Let's move on to t he other terms

# Moving

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 125: Moving.

Welcome back to English as a Second Language Podcas t episode 125. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educa tional Development in, where else, beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This podcast, like all of our podcasts, is made pos sible by the work of Dr. Lucy Tse who writes the scripts and does most of the wor k involved here. I am the voice of the podcast and Lucy does all the work so,  as usual, we want to thank her for everything she does.

Today’s podcast is going to be about someone moving  from one house or one apartment to another house or apartment. Let’s go!

[start of dialogue]

Edmundo: What are you doing?

Ruth: Oh, I'm packing. My lease is up at the end of  the month and I'm moving to Vancouver for six months while my boyfriend is fini shing his degree at the university.

Edmundo: Oh, wow. Are you moving yourself or are yo u using a moving company?

Ruth: I'm renting a U-Haul and doing it myself. I'm  putting some of my furniture in storage since we plan to move back here after he gr aduates.

Edmundo: Can I help? Do you need me to forward your  mail?

Ruth: Thanks for the offer. I've submitted a change -of-address form to the post office so I hope my mail will get forwarded automat ically. One thing I have to remember to do is to shut off the utilities: gas, e lectricity, and phone‚ but I'll have two more weeks to do that.

Edmundo: Well, good luck in Vancouver. I don't envy  you. I hate moving. Let me know if you need any help with those boxes.

Ruth: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

 [end of dialogue]

We’re talking about someone who needs to move from one house or apartment or one city to another city. In this dialogue, we b egin with Edmundo saying, “What are you doing?” And Ruth, his friend, says, “ Oh, I’m packing.” “I’m packing” (packing). “To pack” means to put things i n a box or in a suitcase – in a bag – so that you can take them somewhere else. If you are going on a trip, you pack a bag or a suitcase. If you are moving, you ha ve to pack everything in your house, put things in boxes and in bags to move them .

So, Ruth says she’s packing because her “lease is u p” at the end of the month. A “lease” (lease) is a contract. It’s a legal agreeme nt when you rent an apartment or a house; you have to sign a contract. We call th at contract a “lease.” When you rent a house or an apartment or a car, anything  that you are going to use, you have this lease. So, you sign a lease. When the  lease is over, when your contract is over, we say that your “lease is up.” “ Your lease is up.” It’s just an idiom that we have. So, Ruth’s lease is up at the e nd of the month and we learnt that she is moving to Vancouver.

Well, Edmundo says, “Wow” (wow) – is an expression of surprise or when something is really amazing to you. Unusually , you  might say, “Wow.” Edmundo says, “Wow, are you moving yourself or are you usin g a moving company?” Well, “to move yourself” would mean you would put everyth ing in your own car and drive there. To use a moving company is a company w ith a big truck that comes and people put your things into the truck and the t ruck drives to your new house – your new apartment - and they “unpack.” Notice the opposite of pack is to “unpack” (unpack) – all one word. So, they take you r things and they put them into your new house. Actually, to unpack means to t ake things out of the boxes – just moving the boxes into your house – your new ho use is not the same as “unpacking,” technically. Although there are some c ompanies that if you pay them enough money, they’ll pack and unpack your hou se.

Well, Ruth says that she is going to move herself. She’s doing it by herself and she’s renting a “U-Haul.” Well, “U-Haul” is the nam e of a company that rents trucks to individual people so they can use their b ig trucks for moving. It’s just one company, but it’s a very company  in the entire  United States. So, when someone says they’re renting a “U-Haul” – and I sho uld explain U-Haul is spelled (U) – the capital (U)-(HAUL). “To haul” (haul) is s imilar to move. The verb “to haul” means to move. So, “U-Haul” means you are going to move. You are going to haul your things. So, someone says, “I’m renting  a U-Haul” – they mean a truck from the company called “U-Haul.”

 Ruth says she’s putting some of her furniture, her chairs, her tables, her couch, – couch is the same as a sofa – in “storage.” When we  say, “I’m going to put something in storage” (storage) they mean that you are going to rent a place that will keep your things for however long you want the m to. You have to pay them. So, you have a little space where you can put all of your things and there are many companies that have big buildings where you ca n rent a little part of the space – very popular in Los Angeles. And this is ca lled “storage.”

So, she’s putting some of her things in storage and  when she moves back to whatever city she is in, she will then take it out of storage and be able to use it again. Edmundo offers to help Ruth. “Can I help?” h e says. “Do you need me to forward your mail?” “To forward” (forward) – as a v erb – “to forward” – means that something – you get a letter. It comes to you and you forward it to someone else. So, you mail it again to someone else. In the  United States, there is just one government – semi-government, partially government supported company that delivers regular mail – the United States Postal Se rvice. There are many private companies which will also deliver letters, packages , boxes – companies like Federal Express or, another very popular one is cal led “UPS” – United Postal Service. Those are private companies. But for your regular mail – for your bills, for the letters, normal letters, you use the govern ment sponsored United States Postal Service. People usually just call it the “po st-office.” Well, if you are going to move, you need to tell the post-office where you r new address is and they will forward your mail. So, instead of sending it to you r old address, they will send it to your new address – this is called “forwarding” y our mail.

Ruth says to Edmundo, “Thanks for the offer,” meani ng thank you for asking me to help. She says, “I’ve submitted a change of addr ess form to the post office.” A “change of address form” (form) is just a little ca rd that says, “Hey, I’m moving. Please send my mail to this new address.” And if yo u are going to move in the United States, you usually have to send that card a t least a couple of weeks before. Some post offices, some places, it can be a  shorter time. But it’s safer to send it early. And then you tell them, “Beginning o n this day, I want my mail forwarded. “ Well, this is a change of address form  and she submitted (submitted) – means she gave, in this case, she sub mitted the form to the post- office – her local post-office – the post office wh ere she lives right now. And she, therefore, says that her mail will get forwarded au tomatically, so that she doesn’t have to do anything special.

She says, “One thing I have to remember is to shut off the utilities.” “Utilities” (utilities) are the gas, the electricity, the water , your phone – these are all your utilities at a house or an apartment. “To shut off the utilities” means to turn off.

But we use that special verb “to shut off” especial ly for gas, electricity and water. So, you shut off your utilities, you stop them. So,  you tell the gas company, “I’m leaving.” You tell the phone company, “I want you t o get rid of this number.” So, you cancel or shut off all of these different thing s and you have to do that before you move.

Well, Edmundo wishes Ruth good luck in Vancouver. S he’s moving to the city of Vancouver in Canada. He says, “I don’t envy you. I hate moving.” “To envy” (envy) means the same as to be jealous. I want what  you have. You, for example, you buy a new car – a nice car. And I want  your car. I “envy you,” meaning I want to have what you have. But Edmundo s ays, “I don’t envy you,” meaning it’s not a very pleasant good thing to have  to move. But he tells her, “Let me know if you need any help.” “Let me know” means tell me if you need any help.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Edmundo: What are you doing?

Ruth: Oh, I'm packing. My lease is up at the end of  the month and I'm moving to Vancouver for six months while my boyfriend is fini shing his degree at the university.

Edmundo: Oh, wow. Are you moving yourself or are yo u using a moving company?

Ruth: I'm renting a U-Haul and doing it myself. I'm  putting some of my furniture in storage since we plan to move back here after he gr aduates.

Edmundo: Can I help? Do you need me to forward your  mail?

# Awards Show Season

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 126: Awards Show Season.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast epi sode 126. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center f or Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

The script and research for today’s program is  pro vided by, as always, Dr. Lucy Tse.

This podcast is going to be talking about all of the awards or prizes that are given to the best songs, movies, and television shows in the United States. Let’s get started! > It's that time of year again. It's award show seaso n. No, I'm not talking about the Nobel Prizes. I'm talking about the entertainment a wards. This is the time of year when the TV shows and movies are nominated as the b est of the year. Celebrities get together at an award ceremony and t he winners are announced. My favorites are the Emmy Awards for television, the Academy Awards for the movies, and the Grammy Awards for records. But, I'm  up for almost any award show‚ The Golden Globes, the SAG Awards, even the P eople's Choice Awards.
> For some people, the best part of watching the awar d shows is the pre-show. The celebrities arrive on the red carpet and are in terviewed. Sometimes what they are wearing, made by the top designers and jew elers, gets more attention than anything they say. But, it's still fun to see all of the celebrities all in one place, and you never know what will come out of the ir mouths when they win ; better yet, when they lose.

We’re talking about awards or prizes that are given  to movies and songs, television programs in the United States. Our story  begins by saying, “It’s that time of year again.” “it’s time of ” is an expressi on that we use to say, once again, this is the weeks, the months when we do a certain thing. You can use that expression for “It’s time of the week .” You can sa y, “It’s that time of year.” You

can use it with other types of time. But when we sa y, “It’s that time of year again” we mean once again, we are going to get the same ev ent, the same thing is going to happen. But what’s going to happen here is  that there are going to be Awards Shows and the story continues, “It’s Award S how season.”

A “season” (season) is a period of time. A couple of weeks, a couple of months, whenever something is happening so, “Award Show sea son” are the weeks and months when there are these prizes given and they’r e given at a show. So, “Award Show” is usually in a big theater or in a bi g room where everyone comes together and they give out the award. Notice the ve rb there “to give out an award” – means to give someone an award.

Well, to give out the award would be the actual sho w, in this case. Well, the story says, “I’m not talking about the Nobel prizes.” And  you know the “Nobel (Nobel) Prize” is one of the most famous prizes in the worl d, given to the best scientists and the best people who are good writers, the best writers. There’s also the Nobel Peace Prize and these are given every year in  Stockholm, Sweden. Well, we’re not talking about the Nobel prizes, not that important. We’re talking about entertainment awards. And this is the time of year when the TV shows and movies are nominated. “To be nominated,” “to nomina te” (nominate) – “to be nominated” – with a “d” at the end – means that you  can win that prize. Usually, it doesn’t mean that you won – that you have won the p rize. It means that you could win the prize. You are a nominee, you are nom inated. So, for example, for the movie awards, the Academy Awards, we call them,  they have four or five films or directors or actors who are nominated in e ach category, meaning they give out lots of awards. They give one award for di fferent types of movies, for different people in the movie, the most important a ctor or actress – man, woman, so forth. Well, these are categories that have four , five nominees – people or films, movies that are nominated. Then they vote - the people who vote for the award will vote – pick one of those five as the win ner.

Well, in the award shows, there are celebrities. An d “celebrity” is a famous person – an actor, or a director, usually someone i nvolved in entertaining other people like songs, movies and TV shows. Well, these  people are all celebrities and they get together at an award ceremony. An awar d show can also be called an “award ceremony” (ceremony). A “ceremony” is a f ormal event in which you give someone something or something important happe ns. There are lots of different types of award ceremonies or award shows.  The television people have their own awards and in the United States, the awar ds are called the “Emmy” (Emmy). That word doesn’t mean anything in English.  An “Emmy” award or simply an “Emmy” is an award that is given for the best television shows, the best television actors, so forth. For a movie, they’re c alled the “Academy Awards”

(academy). Some people call them simply, the “Oscar  Awards” or “The Oscars.” “The Oscars” are the little award – what the actual  award is called. It’s a man in gold and it’s you know, maybe a foot, 12 inches, 16  inches high, and that’s called “The Oscar.” So, the “Academy Awards” or the “Oscar  Awards” are for movies. And for songs, in the United States, they’re called  the “Grammy Awards” (grammy). Again, doesn’t really mean anything in En glish – the word “Grammy.” It probably comes from “Gramophone” which is an old  type of way of playing music or sound. But the “Grammy Awards” are for son gs or for records. And a record, of course, is a collection of songs.

Well, in the story, the person says, “I’m up for al most any award show.” When you say, “I am up for something” you mean I am will ing to do or watch, in this case, that show. “I am up for swimming” means I’m i nterested in going swimming. I would want to go swimming if I had the chance. So, “I’m up for any award show” means I would watch any award show if i t were on television. And then there’s a list of some other famous award show s in the U.S. – the “Golden Globes” (globes). “Golden,” of course means that it  looks like gold. The “Golden Globes” are awards that are given to both movies an d television shows. The “SAG Awards” (SAG) – the “S” stands for screen. A “ screen” is what you go into when you go into a movie theater. You see the movie  on a movie screen – “screen.” Well, “screen” – the SAG Awards are for t he screen actor or Screen Actors Guild. And a “guild” (guild) is an old word in English. Here it just means the union or the work organization. Well, they have  the Screen Actors Guild – these are all the actors – their organization – the y have their own awards. And there’s also something called the “People’s Choice Awards” where you can, living in the United States, vote for your favorite TV sho w or movie. And that’s called the “People’s Choice Awards.”

For many people, the most interesting part of the a ward show is not the actual show, but what happens before the show. What’s some times called a “pre-show” – (pre) show. And the “pre-show” is when the stars and the celebrities arrive at the theater or the place where the award ceremony i s being held – is going on. And when they arrive, they usually walk up a carpet  that is on the ground and it is a “red carpet.” In fact, the expression in English,  “to roll out the red carpet,” meaning to put down the red carpet – means to give someone a very good treatment, to do everything you can to make someone  feel welcome. Well, the stars come up the red carpet and there are televisi on stations and reporters from newspapers that interview them, that talk to them a nd one of the  things they talk about, particularly for women, is the kind of dress  they are wearing. In fact, one question they will often get is, “What are you wear ing?” Of course, they’re usually wearing a dress – the women are – but what that que stion means is who’s the

designer, who made your dress. And people who desig n, who make dresses and figure out how they should look are called “designe rs.”Of course, stars also have diamonds and other types of jewelry, like a ring or  earrings, and these are made by people called “jewelers.” A “jeweler” (jewelers)  is someone who sells – makes and sells jewels.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech. > It's that time of year again. It's award show seaso n. No, I'm not talking about the Nobel Prizes. I'm talking about the entertainment a wards. This is the time of year when the TV shows and movies are nominated as the b est of the year. Celebrities get together at an award ceremony and t he winners are announced. My favorites are the Emmy Awards for television, the Academy Awards for the movies, and the Grammy Awards for records. But, I'm  up for almost any award show‚ The Golden Globes, the SAG Awards, even the P eople's Choice Awards.
> For some people, the best part of watching the awar d shows is the pre-show. The celebrities arrive on the red carpet and are in terviewed. Sometimes what they are wearing, made by the top designers and jew elers, gets more attention than anything they say. But, it's still fun to see all of the celebrities all in one place, and you never know what will come out of the ir mouths when they win ; better yet, when they lose.

# Answering Machine Messages

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 127: Answering Machine Messages.

Hello, and welcome back to English as a Second Lang uage Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in the beautiful city of Los Angeles, C alifornia.

Also contributing to this podcast and writing our s cripts and material is Dr. Lucy Tse.

Today’s podcast is going to be about the messages t hat you hear when you call someone and you get their answering machine or voic email. Let’s get started! > I got two tickets to a show at the last minute and I tried to find someone to go with me. First, I called Amanda. The phone rang and  rang and then her answering machine picked up.
> "Hi, I'm not in right now. Leave me a message and I 'll get back to you as soon as I can."
> Amanda wasn't home or she was screening her calls. I didn't want to leave a message and decided to try Celia. The phone rang ab out six times and then I heard,
> "This is the voicemail for Celia . Leave me a messa ge after the long beep. Or, you can try my cell phone at 213-555-1212. Have a n ice day."
> By this time, I was starting to feel discouraged. I  didn't want to go to the show by myself, so I tried one last time. I called Leslie a t work.
> "Hello, you've reached the office of Leslie Munroe.  I am in a meeting or with a client. I'm sorry to miss your call. Please stay on  the line and leave a detailed message. I will return your call as soon as I can. Thank you for calling."
> I decided to leave a message. Leslie called me righ t back and we made plans for the show. We had a great time.
> This podcast is about the kinds of messages that yo u hear – what we would call “outgoing messages” on an answering machine. “Outgo ing” because when you call someone’s telephone and they aren’t there, the y don’t answer and they have an answering machine, there is a message that goes out from the machine. And so, we call this the “outgoing” (outgoing) – the “o utgoing” message.

Well, the story begins with the person saying that they have two tickets to a show. And a “show” could be a movie, it could be a musical show, it could be any sort of entertainment – could be a play and so fort h. He doesn’t say, but he says he has tickets to a show and he got them at the las t minute. When we say, “at the last minute” we mean that it was right before t he event or right before the end of the possibility of getting tickets. So, if you a re going to a movie that starts at 8 PM and you buy your tickets at 7:55 PM, you got you r tickets at the last minute – the last possible chance.

Well, he gets tickets at the last minute and he tri es to find someone to go with him. He calls Amanda. The phone rang and rang and n otice “rang” (rang) is the past tense of “to ring.” So, you hear the phone rin g and in the past tense it’s “rang.” But she wasn’t home because her answering m achine picked up. “Answering machine” is, of course, that little mach ine or device – a piece of equipment that records messages when you’re not hom e. Nowadays, most or many people have what’s called “voicemail.” “Voicem ail” – all one word (voicemail) – it can also be spelled as two separat e words, “voice” “mail” – is an electronic recording. So, you don’t have a physical , actual machine but there is an electronic system that automatically records. An d most cell phones, cellular phones, mobile phones, for example, have voicemail on them and some people in their homes – the telephone company provides an electronic voicemail.

Well, this case, we have an answering machine – the  old kind – and the story says the answering machine “picked up.” “To pick up ” means to answer. So, if we say, “Please pick up the phone” – two words (pick) (up) – we mean to pick up literally, the receiver. And the receiver is what y ou talk into – that’s the part of the phone that has one part for your ear and one part f or your mouth. “To pick up the receiver” means to answer the phone. But here, “the  answering machine picked up,” meaning it started to play the outgoing messag e. And the message was very informal and this is the sort of message you would hear on someone’s home phone or personal phone. It said, “Hi. I’m not in r ight now.” Well, “Hi” (hi) is, of course, informal way of saying hello. So, when some one says, “Hi” in a voicemail, that is an informal address. People can also use “Hi” to start a letter or

an email. But it’s very informal and I think a litt le more common among younger people than it is among old people like me.

So, he says, “Hi, I’m not in,” or she says, I’m sor ry, “Hi. I’m not in right now.” When you say you are not “in” you mean that you are  not there to answer the phone. So, “I’m not in right now. Leave a message a nd I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.” When we say we’re going to “get bac k to someone” we mean we are going to call them back. We are going to return  their call. So, if you call, leave me a message. I will call you back. I will get back  to you. We could use that expression “to get back to” for a phone call, for a n email, for a personal meeting. Someone in your office says to you, “Please get bac k to me about this project.” You can go and talk to them face to face. So, any of those could be used with “get back to you.”

Well, Amanda wasn’t home or she was “screening her calls.” “To screen” (screen) – “to screen your calls” means that you’re  there and you hear the answering machine and you can hear the voice of the  person, but you don’t pick up the phone because, maybe, you don’t have time or  you don’t want to talk to that person – that is to “screen” your calls. And m any people don’t like when other people they’re trying to call, screen their c alls. But I think it’s pretty common. You can only do this with an answering mach ine, however, if it is a voicemail, an electronic recording, it’s not possib le to screen your calls. Although there is now a new way of seeing who is calling you  and we call that “Caller ID” or caller identification. “Caller” (caller) is a pe rson who is making the telephone call and you can get a special box that you hook up  to your telephone and as soon as someone calls, you will see their telephone  number and their name on the little screen so you can decide if you want to answer the call or not. Most cell phones – mobile phones – have this what’s called “C aller ID” feature. Now, because some people don’t like to have their inform ation on Caller ID, you can ask the telephone company to block your Caller ID i nformation. And so, for example, on my home phone, if I were to call you – if I call you on my phone at home, I have “Caller ID.” I have Caller ID blocking , so nothing would come up on the little machine.

Well, this is almost like a war between people beca use now the telephone companies here in the United States have a service – an option – that you will not accept calls for people who block their caller ID. So, if you call, for example, my brother and because I have Caller ID blocking, I  don’t want him to see who I am, he has a service which will block my call. So, when I call him I get an automatic message that says, “This caller does not accept blocked calls.” And so, I have to press a special number to unblock my calls. Well, anyway that’s Caller ID and Caller ID blocking and blocking the C aller ID blocking. It’s very

interesting. People are, of course, concerned about  their privacy. Their “privacy” (privacy) means keeping your things private – secre t – so no one else knows.

Well, Amanda wasn’t home, as I said before, and so the person in our story decides to call another friend, Celia. Celia is a w oman and the phone rang about six times and then her voicemail picked up or answe red. And you hear the outgoing message. “This is the voicemail for Cecili a. Leave a message after the long beep.” So, the message begins with identifying  who this is. This is the voicemail for Cecilia. Notice she doesn’t give her last name. Many people don’t like to give too much information on their outgoing  message. Some people do not even say their name. Some people have messages that  say, “Please leave a message after the beep,” or here, “Leave me a messa ge after the long beep.” A “beep” (beep) is the sound that you hear after or r ather before you leave your message. So, you’ll hear someone say, “Please leave  a message after the beep.” You’ll hear that sound and then you leave a message. And that’s very common to hear that on outgoing voice messages.

The message also says that you can try her cell pho ne, Celia’s cell phone, and gives the cell phone number. That’s also common for  people to give you another telephone number. Notice that the telephone number in our story has an area code which is three numbers. All parts of the Unite d States have a three number – what we call an area code (area) (code) – two wor ds. This one, 213, is the area code for downtown Los Angeles area. And then there’ s the seven number local number – this one was 555-1212. 555 is not a real t elephone number. So, if you are watching a television movie or a regular movie and you hear the person give a telephone number, usually they’ll give a number t hat is 555 which means it’s not a real number. It’s a fake or phony or false nu mber. And that’s because they don’t want to give real telephone numbers out. They  don’t want to use a real telephone number for a movie because then everyone would call that number. So, the voicemail for Celia ends with “Have a nice day.”

Well, by this time, the person calling feels “disco uraged.” And “to be discouraged” means that you’re feeling frustrated, you’re feelin g sad, you’re trying to do something, and it’s not working. So, finally he cal ls his friend Leslie. And he says, “Hello.” Well, he calls Leslie and Leslie is at wor k but she is not in her office. So, her voicemail answers. Her voicemail picks up and i t says, “Hello you’ve reached the office of Leslie Munroe” – that’s another commo n, more formal way of having a voice – outgoing voice message. “You’ve reached” means this is the person you are calling – Leslie Munroe. So, you’ve reached  Jeff McQuillan from the Center for Educational Development. You’ve reached the office of Jeff McQuillan which sounds even more formal. In this message, it’ s again common in business when you call a business and a person is not there and you get their voicemail,

they’ll tell you, “I’m in a meeting,” or “I’m talki ng to another client.” A “client” of course, is a customer – (client). In the voicemail,  Leslie says, “I’m sorry to miss your call” – means I’m sorry I wasn’t here when you  called. I missed it. Please stay on the line and leave a detailed message. “To stay on the line” means don’t hang up, wait. A “detailed message” would be a mess age which has your name, your telephone number and so forth. Leslie says tha t she will return this call as soon as she can. “To return the call,” of course, m eans the same as to get back to or to call back, but “return your call” – a litt le more formal or for a business situation. Well, the caller here leaves a message a nd Leslie calls him right back. “To call someone right back” – (right) back – means  to call them immediately, to call them right away.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of story]

I got two tickets to a show at the last minute and I tried to find someone to go with me. First, I called Amanda. The phone rang and  rang and then her answering machine picked up.

"Hi, I'm not in right now. Leave me a message and I 'll get back to you as soon as I can."

Amanda wasn't home or she was screening her calls. I didn't want to leave a message and decided to try Celia. The phone rang ab out six times and then I heard,

"This is the voicemail for Celia. Leave me a messag e after the long beep. Or, you can try my cell phone at 213-555-1212. Have a nice day."

By this time, I was starting to feel discouraged. I  didn't want to go to the show by myself, so I tried one last time. I called Leslie a t work.

"Hello, you've reached the office of Leslie Munroe.  I am in a meeting or with a client. I'm sorry to miss your call. Please stay on  the line and leave a detailed message. I will return your call as soon as I can. Thank you for calling."

I decided to leave a message. Leslie called me righ t back and we made plans for the show. We had a great time.

# Hiring Contractors

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 128: Hiring Contractors

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 128. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

The script for today’s podcast and production is, a s always, by Dr. Lucy Tse, and we thank her for help.

Today’s podcast is going to be about hiring a contr actor – someone who comes and works on your house or your office to change it  or to fix it. Let’s get started! > My company decided that it was time to remodel our offices and I was put in charge of getting bids from contractors. The troubl e was, I had heard horror stories from friends who did remodeling and I was w orried about finding a company that would get the job done on time and und er budget.
> No doubt there are many honest contractors, but som e of the people I talked to had experiences with shady companies. Some of them weren't on the level about being able to meet deadlines and some tried to get away with murder when they billed for a job. It was important that I found a c ompany that was on the up and up.
> I got bids from six companies and checked all of th eir references. In the end, I picked a company that had done work for one of the biggest companies in the city. They seemed to be the best and our company hi red them. I have my fingers crossed that everything will go smoothly.

Today we are talking about hiring a contractor. And  the word “contractor” (contractors) is, comes from rather, the word contr act, which is an agreement, of course, between two people. We would say an agreeme nt between two “parties” (parties). It’s the same word as “parties” when you  celebrate, but when we say there’s a “contract between two parties,” we mean e ither between two individuals or between two companies or groups of individuals. Well, a “contractor” – with an

“or” at the end – is the name of the person who doe s the contract. And usually, when we talk about a “contractor,” we’re usually ta lking about someone who works independently. In fact, we use the term “inde pendent contractor.” This is a person who works for him or herself, not for anothe r company and you can hire this person just to do a specific job. And when the y’re done with that job, you pay them, and that’s it. They go on to another job.

Well, in this story for this podcast, the person in  the story says that “It was time to remodel our offices.” “To remodel” (remodel) means to fix, to change, to improve, to make better. And usually, we use this verb when we are talking about a house or a building where we are going to, for example, r emodel our bathroom. That means we’re going to fix it, put in some new cabine ts, put in a new bathtub – that would be remodeling. Well, in the story, this perso n is remodeling their office and he was put in charge of getting bids from contracto rs. “To be put in charge of” – that expression means that they were responsible fo r. So, if I say, “I’m putting you in charge of finding a new gardener for our gar den,” – a “gardener” – someone who works in a garden – that means that you  are responsible for that. It’s your job to do it. You must be the leader, the  boss, for that particular task, that particular job.

A “bid” (bid) is when a company or an independent c ontractor says, “We can do that job for a thousand dollars.” In other words, a  “bid” is an offer to do a particular job. And you get many different bids and  then you find the bid that you like best. Well, he was supposed to get bids from c ontractors. The trouble was he had heard “horror stories” from friends who did rem odeling. “Horror stories” (horror) – two words – “horror stories” – a “horror  story” is normally a scary story like, for example, “Count Dracula the Vampire” is a  horror story. In this case, however, when someone says, “I heard a horror story ” they mean I heard a horrible experience. A person who had a very bad – it’s a very bad story of something that went wrong. And usually this is, for  example, you’re talking about a vacation you took. And it was a really bad hotel.  And you tell your friends that it’s a horrible hotel. They might say, “Oh, I heard  horror stories about that hotel. I heard bad stories about it.”

Well, the person in our story here, which is not a horror story, was worried about finding a company that would “get the job done on t ime.” “The job” (job) here just means the specific task. A “task” (task) is the sam e as a small job. Well, “to get the job done on time,” means to get it done when it  is scheduled to be done. So, if you promise to finish it by Friday, you must com plete it by Friday to be “on time.” The other thing that he wanted is that the c ompany would come in “under budget.” “Under budget” – “budget” (budget) – is ho w much money you are going to spend. So, when someone says they’re “under budg et” – we often use the

expression “to come in under budget” – means that i t will cost less than they had planned. So, if the contract bid is for a thousand dollars, but it only cost $750, that contract came in under budget.

The story continues, “No doubt there are many hones t contractors.” When someone uses the expression “no doubt,” they mean “ of course.” “Of course, there are many honest contractors,” or “I believe t hat there are many honest contractors.” But some of the people he talked too had experiences with “shady companies.” “Shady” (shady) would be a company that  isn’t honest. A dishonest company would be “shady.” They try to steal your mo ney or they don’t finish what they say they are going to finish – that would be a  “shady company.” In Britain, they would probably use a term like “dodgy” (dodgy) . “Dodgy” – as the Brits – someone from Britain might say it – is the same as “shady” in American English. Well, some of these contractors, according to our s tory, weren’t “on the level” about being able to meet deadlines. “To be on the l evel” (level) – that means again, to be honest. So, if someone says, “I’m on t he level with you,” they mean I am telling you the truth. I am being honest with yo u.

The companies, some of the companies, “try to get a way with murder” when they bill for a job. The expression “To get away with mu rder” (murder) – literally, “murder” means when someone kills someone else. But  the expression “To get away with murder” means that you did a terrible thi ng, a very bad thing but you get away, meaning you are able to do it without bei ng punished or perhaps, without anyone knowing. So, “To get away with murde r” is to do a very bad thing but you do not have to – you are not punished for i t.

Well, “To bill for a job” (bill) means that you ask  for money. So, “I’m going to bill you for something” means I’m going to send you a bi ll and tell you how much money you have to pay me. The company that the pers on in our story is looking for, he wants it to be “on the up and up.” The expr ession “on the up and up” – and “up” (up) – just like “up and down” – to be “on  the up and up” means once again, the same as to be on the level. It means it’ s an honest company, a company that tells the truth.

Well, the person here gets bids from six companies and checks all of their references. “To check” is the same as to investigat e. And a “references” (references) – “references” are when the names of p eople or companies that you have done work for. So, if I am a contractor, and I  worked for Mr. Jones and Mrs. Smith, I would say, “Well, here are my references.”  And I would give them the name and the telephone number of these people and y ou can call them and say, “Well did this person do a good job?” You have refe rences for contract bids. You also have references for a job, of course, people t hat you have worked for.

 Well, in the end, he decided to pick a company that  had done work for one of the biggest companies in the city, or had worked for. A nd the person in our story says that he has his “fingers crossed” that everyth ing would go smoothly. “To have your fingers crossed” (crossed) means that you  are hoping, you are praying, you’re not sure and we use that expression  when you don’t have any more control over what will happen. So, “I have my fingers crossed that it won’t rain today.” I can’t control that, but I am hoping I am lucky. And to cross your fingers, you take the first two fingers, of course,  and you put the middle finger – the second finger, not counting your thumb – the se cond finger behind the first finger. And that is “crossing your fingers.” Well, for things to go “smoothly” means that they will go without problems – that the contr actor won’t give the company any problem.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue or the story, rath er, this time at a native rate of speech. > My company decided that it was time to remodel our offices and I was put in charge of getting bids from contractors. The troubl e was, I had heard horror stories from friends who did remodeling and I was w orried about finding a company that would get the job done on time and und er budget.

# A Flaky Friend

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 129: A Flaky Friend.

Welcome to episode 129 of English as a Second Langu age Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s script is written by Dr. Lucy Tse, and wethank her always for her help in this podcast.

The title of today’s podcast is “A Flaky Friend.” L et’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Shawn: What's the matter? You look like you're abou t to blow your lid.

Rick: Yeah, let's just say I'm not happy.

Shawn: That's putting it lightly. What's up?

Rick: My friend Steve was supposed to come by here after work to give me a ride home. I lent him my car so he could take his girlfr iend out for the day. I've been waiting 45 minutes and he's a no-show. I should hav e known better than to count on a flake like him.

Shawn: Maybe something came up. Have you tried call ing him on his cell phone?

Rick: Yeah, I have and there's no answer. I can't b elieve he's left me high and dry.

Shawn: Tell you what. I'm almost done with my repor t. If you can wait another 15 minutes, I'll give you a lift home.

Rick: Really? That would be great.

Shawn: It's no big deal. But, I definitely don't wa nt to be there when you find Steve.

[end of dialog]

 The title of this episode is “A Flaky (flaky) Frien d.” The adjective “flaky” means unreliable, someone who doesn’t do what they tell y ou they will do. This is particularly true in a social obligation. Someone s ays they are going to meet you at the café at 2 o’clock and they don’t go on time or they don’t go at all. In fact, there is a noun which is a “flake” (flake) and that  is a person who is not reliable and there’s also a verb “to flake” or “to flake out ” – means that you do something – that you’re not reliable, that you don’t do what you’re supposed to do. Usually, it means that you don’t go somewhere where you are supposed to go.

In this particular dialog, we begin with Shawn, who  asks her friend Rick, “What’s the matter?” meaning what is the problem. “You look  like you’re about to blow your lid. “To blow (blow) your lid (lid)” means you  are about to get angry. “To blow your lid” means to get very, very angry. You can think of a pot of water that’s boiling. And there’s a top on it, because a “lid” (lid) is a top and if it boils too much, the lid may come off, because there’s so much  pressure. Well, here we use it just to mean to get very angry. And Rick say s, “Yeah, let’s just say I’m not happy.” The expression “Let’s just say” is used bef ore an expression of how we are feeling or what we are thinking, but we don’t want the other person to know completely. We want to make it more relaxed or more  mild. So, if I’m really angry, for example, but I don’t want to say it to the othe r person, I’m really angry, I might say, “Let’s just say I’m somewhat upset. I’m a litt le mad at you.” And the other person knows that, of course, the truth is much gre ater and much more serious and usually, we – well, often we use this expressio n when we’re angry or there’s a problem with something. And rather than give the complete truth, we say more politely and more nicely than what we are thinking.

Well, when Rick says, “I’m not happy,” Shawn replie s, “That’s putting it lightly.” “To put something lightly (lightly)” means, once ag ain, it’s like the expression, “Let’s just say.” “To put something lightly” means that you’re being very polite that you’re angry or you’re upset but you’re not express ing that, you’re not saying that to the other person. Shawn then asks Rick, “What’s up?” meaning what’s going on. Tell me what is happening. And Rick says that h is friend Steve was supposed to come by here after work. When you say someone is  going to “come by (by)” that’s one of those two word verbs in English. It m eans that they are going to go to that place. So, “Someone is going to come by my house,” means someone is going to come to my house. Usually, it means to mak e a visit, for example, or to pick someone up, to give someone a ride. I’ll come by at 7:30 and we will then go to dinner. So, I’m going to go to your house, you’r e going to get into my car and then we will go to dinner together. Well, I’m not p aying but, you know, I’ll give you the ride.

Well, Rick’s friend Steve was supposed to give him a “ride home.” And to give someone a “ride (ride) home” means that they go wit h you in your car and you are driving. So, I give you a ride to the restauran t. Rick says that he “lent” Steve his car, meaning he let him use his car so that he could take his girlfriend out for the day. And he waits for 45 minutes and says that Steve is a “no-show.” A “no (no-show)” – a “no-show” is someone who doesn’t sho w up, someone who doesn’t arrive, who doesn’t come to the place where  they are supposed to. Rick then says, “I should have known better than to coun t on a flake like him.” The expression “I should have known better” means I was  stupid, I didn’t think, I should have – I wish I would have thought. And “sho uld” has that sense of obligation. So, when we say, “I should have done so mething” that means that it was desirable or necessary that something be done, but it didn’t happen. Well, Steve says that he should have known better than to  “count on a flake.” Well, we already know what “flake” means – that’s a person w ho is flaky, who is unreliable. “To count on someone” means that we dep end on them, that we rely on them. “I’m counting on you to help me with my ho mework” would be a use of that verb. “I’m counting on winning the lottery so that I don’t have to work.” Well, good luck.

Shawn then says, “Maybe something came up” with Ric k’s friend Steve. The expression “Something came up” means that you were supposed to do something, you were supposed to, for example, go to  the restaurant at 7 P.M., but then your mother calls and tells you to come ov er and help her with something. Well, you call your friend and you say, “I’m sorry, I can’t go to the restaurant. Something came up,” meaning something e lse – there’s something else that I have to do that’s very important. Rick says that it’s possible.

 He did try calling his friend Steve on his cell ph one and then he says, “I can’t believe he’s left me high and dry.” “To leave someo ne high (high) and dry (dry)” means that you leave them without any other possibl e options. Usually, we use this expression when, for example, you are supposed  to give someone a ride, and you don’t show up, you don’t go. And that perso n doesn’t have any other way of getting where they want to go. “You leave th em high and dry,” meaning they’re stranded – would be another way of saying t hat. “To be stranded” (stranded) means that you are somewhere, but you ca n’t leave that place because you have no way of leaving.

Shawn then says, “Tell you what. I’m almost done wi th my report.” The expression “Tell you what” means I am going to offe r something to you. I’m going to give you something or offer to give you somethin g – that’s how it is used here. You could also say, “Tell you what. I’ll go to the store and buy the food if you cook it.” So, when you are making – it’s sometimes used when you are making

an agreement between two people. Well, Shawn offers  to give her friend Rick a “lift home.” A “lift” (lift) is the same as a ride home. Rick says, Wow, that’s great! And Shawn says, “It’s no big deal,” meaning it’s no t really anything difficult for me or it is not anything you need to thank me very muc h for.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

Shawn: What's the matter? You look like you're abou t to blow your lid.

Rick: Yeah, let's just say I'm not happy.

Shawn: That's putting it lightly. What's up?

Rick: My friend Steve was supposed to come by here after work to give me a ride home. I lent him my car so he could take his girlfr iend out for the day. I've been waiting 45 minutes and he's a no- show. I should ha ve known better than to count on a flake like him.

Shawn: Maybe something came up. Have you tried call ing him on his cell phone?

Rick: Yeah, I have and there's no answer. I can't b elieve he's left me high and dry.

Shawn: Tell you what. I'm almost done with my repor t. If you can wait another 15 minutes, I'll give you a lift home.

Rick: Really? That would be great.

Shawn: It's no big deal. But, I definitely don't wa nt to be there when you find Steve.

# Allergic to Cats

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 130: Allergic to Cats.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 130. My name is Dr. Jeff McQuillan, your host, coming to yo u from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, C alifornia.

Today’s podcast is about people who have problems w hen they are around animals – who are allergic to cats. Let’s get start ed. > When I was little, we had a family pet. His name wa s Jupiter and he was a kitten. I wanted a cat more than anything else, and finally , my parents gave in and said that we could have one. We went to the pound and sa w dozens of cats of different breeds. We went from cage to cage until w e saw a little kitten at the back of one of the  cages. He looked scared, but wh en I picked him up, he wouldn't stop licking my hand and I knew he was the  one we would bring home.
> When we got Jupiter home, I played with him all day . What I noticed when I played with him was that I would sneeze a lot and I  started getting hives on my arm. My nose would also be runny and my eyes would water. I tried to hide these symptoms from my mother, but she noticed them event ually and told me that I was allergic to cats! Even worse, we couldn't keep Jupiter! That was a tragic day in my young life. I thought I would never recover.
> Then, a lucky thing happened. Our neighbor down the  street was willing to adopt Jupiter and I was able to visit him all the time, a s long as I didn't get too close. In the end, it wasn't such a terrible tragedy after al l.

The title of this podcast is “Allergic to Cats.” “A llergic” comes from the word “allergy” (allergy) and an allergy is when your bod y has a negative reaction to something. Sometimes, it’s to the hair of an animal , sometimes it’s to certain kinds of plants or flowers, and what happens is oft en, you will start to, perhaps, cough – all of these – your nose can have a problem , you can start sneezing – all of these are possible symptoms, indications of an a llergy. And “allergic” is the adjective that comes from the word “allergy.”

 Well, today’s podcast is about being allergic to ca ts. And cats, and dogs, of course, are very common for people to have as pets.  And there are many Americans that have cats, sometimes many cats. My s ister has two cats. Well, in the story, we hear about how when she was a little girl, they had a family pet. And the pet’s name was Jupiter, just like the plane t “Jupiter” (Jupiter), and this pet was a kitten. And a “kitten” (kitten) is a smal l cat. Sometimes, we’ll say “kitty” (kitty). “Kitty,” “kitten” – these are all small, u sually, baby cats.

Well, the person in the story here wanted a cat, an d finally, she says, her parents “gave in.” “To give in” – two words – means that, f or example, your friend is saying, “Let’s go to a movie,” and you say, “No, I don’t want to go a movie.” And they keep asking and asking, and finally, you “give  in” – means you say “yes” to someone who you were saying “no” to before. So the parents in this story “give in” to their daughter. And that’s how we would say it, “to give in to someone.” They give in to their daughter and get a kitten. An d they go to the “pound” and see dozens of cats of different breeds. A “pound” ( pound) is, of course, can be something – a way of measuring how heavy something is. I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds, for example – not really. I wish I w eighed 120 pounds. But here the word “pound” is, as a noun – doesn’t mean the w eight or how heavy something is. It means a place where animals who do  not have an owner are kept. And most cities have a “dog pound” or an “ani mal pound” so if a dog is found on the street or a cat, they can be taken and  put into this pound, and the idea is that someone will then come and adopt the p et. And that’s the word we would use – “to adopt a pet.” We also can adopt chi ldren, but here, we use the same verb “to adopt.” So, they go to the pound and they see cats of different breeds. A “breed” (breed) for a dog or a cat, or mo st, any animal, is the type of dog. So, for example, it could be a German shepherd  – that would be one type or breed of dog.

They look for a cat in the pound by going from cage  to cage. A “cage” (cage) is where you keep an animal so that they don’t leave o r don’t escape. And they finally found a little kitten and the girl in the s tory picks up the kitten and he wouldn’t stop licking her hand. “To lick” (lick) me ans to take your tongue and put it on, usually, for example, for a cat, it would ta ke its tongue and lick your hand. So, its tongue would touch your hand and get it wet .

Well, when they got the cat home, the girl in the s tory plays with him, but she notices that when she plays with him, she starts to  “sneeze” (sneeze). “To sneeze” as I said before is to go (sneezes), usuall y because there is something bothering your nose. Well, not only did she start t o sneeze but she started to get “hives” on her arm. And “hives” (hives) are like li ttle bumps, red bumps on your

skin. And again, that’s one thing that can happen i f you are allergic to something. Well, the problems were just beginning. The girl sa ys that her nose would also be “runny” and her eyes would “water.” When we say you r nose is “runny” (runny) we meant that there is liquid coming out of your no se so that you have to get a handkerchief – what we would call a – probably a Kl eenex – which is a type of tissue – white tissue. So, you blow your nose to cl ean it out. But if your nose is running, that’s what is happening. If your eyes are  “watering” – just like to “water” (water) – when your eyes “water” that means that, o nce again, there’s liquid – it’s wet and liquid may be coming out of your eye. It’s kind of like crying but it is because of an allergy.

Well, these are all symptoms of an allergy. And a “ symptom” (symptoms) – “symptoms” – a “symptom” or “symptoms” are indicati ons, they’re signs. They are ways that you can tell if you have sickness, an ill ness or some problem. Here, it would be symptoms of an allergy. Sneezing, a runny nose – and notice we can use “runny” here as an adjective – “a runny nose,” watery eyes – once again, “water” becomes an adjective with a “y” at the end – “watery eyes” – these are all symptoms and what the girl finds out is that she is  allergic to cats. Well, she describes this as a “tragic day in her young life.”  And “tragic” (tragic) is something that’s very sad, something that is very unfortunate , something very bad happens –we say it’s “tragic.” But it’s very serious. Well,  she says this was a ”tragic day” in her life. She thought she would never “recover.” “T o recover” (recover) – “to recover” means to get over, to get better. So, if y ou are sick, when you start to feel better, you are recovering.

Well, then a lucky thing happened in the story. The  neighbor, who lived nearby, or “down the street” – “down the street” here would  mean close to where they were living. He was willing to adopt Jupiter and re member that verb “to adopt” (adopt) – we use with animals as well as with child ren. They adopted Jupiter and took him into their house and then she could go vis it the cat there. She says at the end, “It wasn’t such a terrible tragedy after a ll.” And “tragedy” (tragedy) is the noun of “tragic.” “Tragic” is an adjective – “It wa s a tragic play. It was a tragic event.” And “tragedy” would be the noun. We use tha t word, of course, and also talking about in the theater when a play such as “M acbeth” or “Othello” or a play by one of the great Greek playwrights – ancient Gre ek playwrights such as Sophocles or Euripides – has these great tragedies – plays in which something very terrible happens.

Well, nothing terrible is going to happen to you. L et’s listen instead to this story again, at a native rate of speech.

[start of story]

 When I was little, we had a family pet. His name wa s Jupiter and he was a kitten. I wanted a cat more than anything else and finally,  my parents gave in and said that we could have one.

# Sharing an Apartment

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 131: Sharing an Apartment.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 131. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to learn about what it  means to share your apartment with someone else. Let’s get started! > I've shared a two-bedroom, two- bath apartment with  my roommate for two years. He was moving to Austin and I posted a "roommate wa nted" ad in the local newspaper. I got a few calls, a couple from some ve ry weird people. Finally, I got a call from Andrew. He seemed normal on the phone a nd we agreed he would stop by today to see the apartment.
> When he got there, I showed him around. The apartme nt has a pretty large living room with a large couch and TV. It doesn't have a d ining room, but it does have an eat-in kitchen. My room is the master bedroom wi th a connecting bathroom. My roommate's room was the guest room with the bath room in the hall.
> I told Andrew that he could use any of the furnitur e that my roommate was leaving behind. He was taking his bed and dresser, but he planned to leave his desk in the bedroom. I also told him that he could use any of the appliances‚ the refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker.
> Andrew said he liked the place and we agreed on the  rent and to split the utilities. It was settled. He would move in next month. What a  relief I didn't have to talk to any more weird people!

We’re talking in this podcast about sharing an apar tment. “To share an apartment” means that two people live in the same a partment. In this story, the person is sharing a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment . And we use the term “bath” as short for bathroom. So, there’s two bedro oms and two bathrooms in a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. He’s sharing the a partment with a

“roommate.” And a “roommate” – all one word – (room mate) – a “roommate” is, of course, someone that is in the same room – altho ugh usually we use that if someone is just in the same apartment with you. We call that a “roommate.” You might also hear the term “housemate” which is also one word (housemate). Again, this would be someone who lives with you in the same house. We usually talk about roommates and housemates for people who are paying rent, that is, for someone who’s paying money to be there.

Well, the roommate of the person in our story is mo ving to Austin. And Austin is a city in the state of Texas. It’s actually the capit al of Texas. And the person in the story decided to “post a roommate wanted ad” in the  local newspaper. “To post an ad” (post) means the same as to place an ad or t o put an ad in the paper. And the ad or advertisement was for a roommate. So, “ro ommate wanted.” When you are posting an ad or putting an ad and you want som ething or someone, that’s a very common way of doing it. So you could say, “Ref rigerator wanted,” meaning you are looking for a refrigerator. Well, the same is true here, “roommate wanted.” If you’re looking for someone to work for you, you would say, it is a “help wanted.” So, the “help wanted” section of the  newspaper is where the ads are for jobs.

Well, the person in the story got a few calls, a co uple from some very “weird” people. “Weird” (weird) means strange, unusual. Los  Angeles is full of weird people and if you ever come to Los Angeles, you wil l find that out. And, of course, I am one of those weird people, I think. We ll, back to the story. Finally, the person gets a call from someone named “Andrew” and he “seemed normal on the phone,” meaning he wasn’t weird. He was normal. “On the phone” means when he talked to him on the phone. We use that exp ression “on the phone” also when somebody asks if you are talking on the teleph one. You say, “I’m sorry, I’m on the phone.” I’m talking on the telephone. Any ca se, these two agreed that Andrew would stop by to see the apartment. “To stop  by” – two words – (stop) (by) – means to go and visit and stay for a short t ime somewhere, usually at someone’s house or apartment.

Well, when Andrew got to the apartment, the man in the story showed him around. “To show someone around” means to take him to see all of the different parts, in this case, of the apartment. If someone s ays, “I’m going to show you around Los Angeles, they mean they are going to tak e you to different parts of Los Angeles to visit and to see. But “to show someo ne around in an apartment” means just to show them the different rooms of the apartment.

Now, the apartment was “pretty large.” And, of cour se, we use that word “pretty” (pretty) – “pretty” means very large here. “Pretty, ” of course, also means

beautiful. My wife is pretty, for example. But here  it just means very. So, this apartment has a pretty large living room. And a “li ving room” (living) is the main part, usually, where people sit and talk. Usually, also, in an American house, there would be a television in the living room. Wel l, the living room has a large couch and a “couch” (couch) is the same as a “sofa. ” It’s a place usually, where two or three or maybe even four people can sit and,  of course, the TV. The apartment doesn’t have a “dining room.” And a “dini ng (dining) room” is where you dine. “To dine” (dine) means to eat. Not to be confused with the verb “to die” – “To dine” with an “n” and “to die.” Although, if you eat some really bad food, I guess you could dine and then die.

The apartment has an “eat-in kitchen.” “Eat-in” is hyphenated (eat-in), and that just means that it is big – big enough so that you could put a table in there and eat in the kitchen. The rooms in the apartment incl ude the “master bedroom.” Now, the bedroom, of course, is where you sleep. the “master bedroom” is the biggest bedroom. And usually, in an American house or an apartment, the master bedroom has its own private bathroom for jus t the people. So to get to the bathroom, you have to use the master bedroom. It ha s its own separate bathroom. This story we hear it called the – a “con necting bathroom.” And a “connecting bathroom” just means the bathroom that is part of the master bedroom. It’s connected to the master bedroom. The roommate’s room was the guestroom. And the “guestroom” (guestroom) – the “g uestroom” is, of course, where you have a, normally, a guest. It just means,  in this case, the smaller of the two bedrooms. The guestroom has a bathroom in t he hall. And the “hall” (hall) is the – usually a narrow – not a wide, but a narrow space where you walk and you have the doors to the other rooms in the ha ll. It’s also called the “hallway” (hallway) – all one word – and both of th ese are – another word I guess, would be a passage. It’s a place – it allows  you to go from one part of the house to another part of the house. And usually, the bedrooms in a house are often, you get to them by going through the hallway .

Well, in this story, the person who is renting the apartment, who is looking for a roommate says that his new roommate can use any of the furniture that his old roommate was leaving behind and “to leave behind” j ust means to leave here. Usually, we use that verb “to leave behind” when we  are talking about an object or a thing that you are leaving in a place. You can  leave a thing behind or you could leave a person behind, meaning you go somewhe re else and they stay where they are.

Well, his old roommate is taking his bed and his dr esser. And a “dresser” (dresser) is a place where you keep your clothes. I t usually has three or four drawers and a “drawer” (drawer) is like a little bo x. And you have two or three

drawers – these little boxes that you put into a dr esser – a larger piece that holds the individual drawers. Sometimes, this is actually  called a “chest of drawers.” A “chest (chest) of drawers” – that means the same as  a “dresser.” It’s a place where you keep things in drawers, in these little b oxes that move in and out. Well, he plans on taking these two pieces of furnit ure and of course, “furniture” is just a general word we use for things that you use in your house that are big, like a table, chair, couch, a dresser – those are all ty pes of furniture.

He can also use any of the appliances in the house.  And an appliance (appliance) are the refrigerator where you keep foo d cold and the microwave, where you can heat up food quickly. A “coffee maker ” is a little machine that you use to make coffee. I don’t drink coffee very much anymore. I usually drink tea, but we don’t call a thing to make tea, a “tea maker .” I don’t know if there is anything like that like a coffee maker.

 Anyway, Andrew said that he “liked the place,” mea ning he liked the apartment that he was looking at. And the two men agreed on t he rent. And, of course, the rent (rent) is what you pay for an apartment or a h ouse you may be renting. They decided to split the utilities. “Utilities” (utilit ies) are the gas, the electricity, the water. The telephone, sometimes, is called a “utili ty” – usually though it’s just the gas and the water and the electricity. And when you  rent an apartment or a house or you buy a house or something like that, yo u have to pay separately for your water – that’s one government office. You also  have to pay for your electricity and in the United States, electricity i s all private companies. So, you pay a company for your electricity. Your gas, if yo u have gas, and in some parts of the country, they do not have natural gas – that  you can go to a house. But in the older cities, cities like Los Angeles, we have gas and gas lines or pipes that come to the house, and that’s also a private compan y that you have to pay. So, each of those are separate and you have to pay them  to the individual government office or private company. Well, to spli t the utilities – “to split” (split) means to divide – here divide in half. So, they’ll each pay half of the utilities. Andrew decided that he would move in next month. An d “to move in” is a verb that we use – two-word verb – “move” (move) “in” (i n) – when you are moving to a new apartment, or perhaps, even to a new office. We say we’re going to “move in” – basically the same as to move and that is wha t Andrew is going to do.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech.

[start of story]

I've shared a two-bedroom, two- bath apartment with  my roommate for two years. He was moving to Austin and I posted a "roommate wa nted" ad in the local

newspaper. I got a few calls, a couple from some ve ry weird people. Finally, I got a call from Andrew. He seemed normal on the phone a nd we agreed he would stop by today to see the apartment.

When he got there, I showed him around. The apartme nt has a pretty large living room with a large couch and TV. It doesn't have a d ining room, but it does have an eat-in kitchen. My room is the master bedroom wi th a connecting bathroom. My roommate's room was the guest room with the bath room in the hall.

I told Andrew that he could use any of the furnitur e that my roommate was leaving behind. He was taking his bed and dresser, but he planned to leave his desk in the bedroom. I also told him that he could use any of the appliances‚ the refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker.

Andrew said he liked the place and we agreed on the  rent and to split the utilities. It was settled. He would move in next month. What a  relief I didn't have to talk to any more weird people!

# Getting Through on the Phone.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast number 132: Getting Through on the Phone.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 132. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to talk about trying t o reach someone or communicate with someone on the telephone. Let’s ge t started! > I have been trying to get a meeting with the CEO of  Medofact to talk about a partnership between our company and theirs. But I'v e had a hard time trying to get through on the phone.
> First, there was the phone tree. I had to go throug h three menus before I got the option to speak to an operator. Even after I got th rough, I got the run around from the receptionist.
> Receptionist: Medofact Limited. How may I direct yo ur call?
> Thomas: I would like to speak to Maureen Kennedy.
> Receptionist: Please hold while I connect you with Ms. Kennedy's office. (Pause)
> Secretary: Maureen Kennedy's office. How may I help  you?
> Thomas: Good afternoon. I am Thomas Guarini calling  from Livatect. I would like to set up a meeting with Ms. Kennedy.
> Secretary: Will Ms Kennedy know the subject of the meeting?
> Thomas: Well, I would like to speak to her about a possible partnership.
> Secretary: May I put you on hold for one moment?
> Thomas: Yes, certainly. (I was on hold for a long t ime.)
> We’re talking about trying to make an appointment w ith someone by calling them on the telephone. The name of the podcast is “Getti ng Through on the Phone.” “To get through” means that you are able to, in thi s case, talk to the person that you want to talk to. We also use that expression “t o get through” to mean to get someone to understand us. A parent, for example, mi ght say this about their son or daughter. “I can’t get through to him” means I c an’t seem to communicate with him. He doesn’t seem to understand me, but here, “t o get through” just means to be able to reach someone, or talk to someone on the  telephone. Well, in this case, the person is trying to get a meeting with a CEO. “To get a meeting” is the same as to make a meeting, to make an appointment f or a meeting. The “CEO” is the “Chief Executive Officer” – usually the high est person in a company. The number one person in the company is often called the “Chief Executive Officer” or “CEO.”

Well, the CEO of this company is the person they’re  trying to get a meeting with. And they want to talk about a “partnership” between  the two companies. A “partnership” is, of course, when two people or mor e people come together and have some sort of agreement where they work togethe r. Well, unfortunately, he’s having a hard time trying to get through on the pho ne. First, there was the “phone tree.” And a “phone tree” (tree) – like the tree th at grows in the forest. The “phone tree” is when you call a company and you get a real  person – a live person – you get a message and the message says, “If you want to  talk to Mr. Jones, press 1,” meaning you have to press the number 1 on your tele phone. Well, that’s called a “phone tree.” And he got through, according to the story – he had to go through three menus before he got the option to speak to an  operator. A “menu” is each time you have a choice of things. So, for example, you call a company, and you get the phone tree. And you press number one and th en you get another message saying, “If you want to talk to this person , press 1. If you want to talk to

this person, press 2,” and so forth. And so, you pr ess another number and then you get another menu. So, these are menus in the ph one tree.

Well, he had to go through three of these to get the option or the opportunity – the ability – to speak to an “operator,” meaning the person who answers your call and tells you or helps you find the person you want . The “operator” in a company is the person who directs people. So, you call and you’re not sure who to talk to, the operator will find the right person for you. We ll, even after he got through, he says, he got the “run around” from the receptionist . “To get the run around” – and “run around” is two words – (run) (around) – “to ge t the run around” means that someone is not being very helpful. They’re not givi ng you the information that you need, maybe because they’re lazy or maybe because t hey don’t have time. If you call a government office, you won’t get, sometimes,  an answer. They’ll say, “Well, you have to talk to that person.” So, you call that  person and they say, “No, no. You have to talk to the other person. “ So, that’s called “getting the run around” – when people don’t answer your question or don’t do what you want to do, to have them do, not give you the information that you want .

Well, this gentleman, this person, calls and the re ceptionist answers the phone. This is, of course, the same, in this case, as the operator. She answers the phone but with the name of the company, “Medofact L imited.” That’s not a real company. I just made that name up, invented that na me. The operator says, “How may I direct your call?” That is a very common  expression you’ll hear from people – form an operator in a company. “How may I direct?” means who do you want to talk to so I can find out the right person,  or I can give you the number of the person you need to talk to. So, that’s called –  that expression “How may I direct your call?” – means tell me who you want to talk to and then I can connect you. And “to connect someone” means that you dial t hat person’s number and you connect the two people together.

Well, he says he wants to speak to Maureen Kennedy and the operator says, “Please hold,” meaning please wait while I connect you. When he gets to Ms. Kennedy’s office, the secretary answers, and again,  she answers by saying, “Maureen Kennedy’s office. How may I help you?” – v ery common way to answer the phone in a business, is to identify, to say who  you are and where you are, in this case, Maureen Kennedy’s office.

Well, the gentleman, Thomas, says his name is Thoma s Guarini, calling from “Livatect” – which is the name of his company – als o not a real company. Notice he says, “I’m calling from,” meaning this is the co mpany that I am representing. This is my company I am calling from. “I would like  to set up a meeting with Ms. Kennedy.” The verb “to set up” (set up) – two words  – means to arrange, to make

an appointment – so, to get a meeting is similar to  set up a meeting. “To set up a meeting” means really to schedule, to find a day an d time when you can meet. Well, the secretary says, “Will Ms. Kennedy know the subject of the meeting?” meaning will she know what this meeting is going to  be about. And Thomas says, “Well, I want to speak to her about a possible part nership.” The secretary then says, “May I put you on hold for one moment?” And r emember, “to put someone on hold” means that you have to wait. Usually you h ear music sometimes while you are waiting on the phone, or sometimes you don’ t hear anything. I prefer to hear nothing because usually, the music you hear wh en you are waiting on the phone is really bad. Anyway, so Thomas says, “Sure.  Yes, Certainly.” And that’s an expression we use a lot – “certainly” – it’s a p olite way of saying, “Yes, of course.”

Well, finally the secretary comes back and says, “I ’m afraid Ms. Kennedy is travelling on business.” The expression “I’m afraid ” (afraid) – “I’m afraid” – we use that in front of something that - some bad news  that we are going to tell someone else. So, someone comes up to you and says,  “Can you give me a thousand dollars?” And you say, “I’m afraid I can’t  give you any money.” I’m afraid,” meaning I’m sorry to tell you this, that I  cannot give you any money. Although, you may not be sorry to tell them, but th at’s a polite way of saying that you are going to give them some bad news. Well, the  gentleman in the dialogue says, “Sure, I’ll call back in a couple of weeks.” The secretary asks if he could call back. “To call back” means to call again, to c all on the telephone again. To “check back” means that I’m going to call and see i n two weeks, or however long, whether this person is available.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of story]

I have been trying to get a meeting with the CEO of  Medofact to talk about a partnership between our company and theirs. But I'v e had a hard time trying to get through on the phone.

First, there was the phone tree. I had to go throug h three menus before I got the option to speak to an operator. Even after I got th rough, I got the run around from the receptionist.

Receptionist: Medofact Limited. How may I direct yo ur call?

Thomas: I would like to speak to Maureen Kennedy.

Receptionist: Please hold while I connect you with Ms. Kennedy's office. (Pause)

Secretary: Maureen Kennedy's office. How may I help  you?

Thomas: Good afternoon. I am Thomas Guarini calling  from Livatect. I would like to set up a meeting with Ms. Kennedy.

Secretary: Will Ms Kennedy know the subject of the meeting?

Thomas: Well, I would like to speak to her about a possible partnership.

Secretary: May I put you on hold for one  moment?

Thomas: Yes, certainly. (I was on hold for a long t ime.)

Secretary: Mr. Guarini, I'm afraid Ms. Kennedy is t raveling on business the next two weeks. Would you like to call back?

Thomas: Sure, I'll check back in a couple of weeks.  Thanks for your help.

Secretary: It's my pleasure. Have a nice day.

Thomas: Thanks. You too!

I guess I'll keep trying.

# Going to a Wedding

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 133: Going to a Wedding.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 133. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development, here in beautiful Los Angeles, Califor nia.

On this podcast, we’re going to go to a wedding. Le t’s go! > I got an invitation in the mail last month that rea lly surprised me. My friend Ulrich was getting married! We went to college together an d he always said that he’d never get married. I guess he found his dream girl in the end.
> The church wedding was going to be at 3 p.m. and the reception would start at 7 p.m. at the reception hall.
> I arrived at the church shortly before 3 p.m. and o ne of the ushers asked me if I was a friend of the bride or the groom. I told him that I was a friend of the groom and he sat me on the left side of the church. I saw  Ulrich standing near the front of the church with the best man, and a few minutes later, the pianist started playing the wedding march. The flower girl and ring  bearer walked down the aisle, followed by the bridesmaid. Then, the bride appeared wearing a beautiful wedding dress, walking with her father who was givi ng her away. The bride and groom exchanged vows and they were married. It was a simple and traditional ceremony.
> At the reception, there was a lot of champagne. The  best man made a toast that really embarrassed Ulrich, but it was all in good f un. I got a chance to talk to Ulrich and he seemed really happy. In fact, he was trying to set me up with the bridesmaid. I guess it's true. All married people want to get all of their friends married. We'll see about that!

Today we go to a wedding. Our story begins by the p erson saying he got an “invitation” in the mail last month. An “invitation ” is, of course, when someone asks you to go to a party or a wedding or some spec ial event. You send an

invitation. And his friend, Ulrich, was getting mar ried. Now, the two of them knew each other from college. They went to college toget her, or university together, and he said he would never get married – Ulrich sai d that. But, in the story, the narrator, the person telling the story, says, “I gu ess he found his dream girl in the end.” A “dream girl” – two words – (dream) “girl” –  is the most perfect woman for you, the woman that you want to marry. She looks the way you want her to look and she acts the way you want her to act – that wou ld be your dream girl. He says he found his dream girl in the end. And that e xpression “in the end” means after some time, after some time looking, in this c ase, he found his dream girl.

The church wedding was going to be at 3 PM. And in the United States, as in many countries, you can be married in a church, or you can be married – what we call a “civil ceremony.” “Civil” is (civil) and a “civil ceremony” means that you are married by someone from the government and that  you are registered officially as “married.” Now, in the United States,  if you are married in a church, by a minister or a priest, or a rabbi or whoever is  the leader – if you are married in a church, you do not need to get married by the government. You do not need a separate ceremony to have your marriage recognize d. The ministers and priests are authorized, you could say, are able to perform a ceremony and it doesn’t need – you don’t need to do an extra one. S o, most people who do a “church ceremony” don’t do a civil ceremony and tho se who do a “civil ceremony” probably won’t do a church ceremony either.

Well, this is a church wedding, meaning it was goin g to be in a church and the reception – well, the wedding started at 3 P.M. The  reception was going to start at 7 P.M and the “reception” (reception) – that is the party – that’s the party that you have after the wedding ceremony where there’s d ancing and eating and perhaps drinking – that’s a reception and that’s a special word we use for a party after a wedding. You can also have a reception afte r another event and that, sometimes – word, is used sometimes also. The recep tion was going to be at the reception hall. And a “hall” (hall) here means a bi g building with a large – usually a large space where you can put many tables and hav e a – maybe a place for people to dance and food and there are many of thes e reception halls that you can rent for one night and some of them are run by church organizations, some of them are run by community – private community or ganizations. And there are even some governments, some city governments and co unty governments – the city government in the United States, would be, for  example, the city of Los Angeles, but all of the states in the United States  are broken up into larger units – you call them and these are called “counties.” So, the county and city government sometimes has its own places that you ca n rent for a reception.

In the story, the person arrived at the church shor tly before three, and one of the ushers asked him if he was a friend of the bride or  the groom. An “usher” (usher) – an “usher” is, at a wedding, or in a church in ge neral, church or synagogue, I should say – it’s a person who helps you to your se at so things are a little more organized, a little more orderly. So, when you come  to the back of the church, there’ll be an usher that will help you find a seat  in the church. And in weddings, it’s traditional to ask the person coming, “Are you  a friend of the bride?” And the “bride” (bride) – that’s the girl, the woman being married – or the “groom” (groom) – and the groom is the man. It depends which side of the church you sit on, if you’re a friend of the bride or a friend of the gro om. If you’re the friend of both, you have to sit outside the church. No, no, no I’m kidding – joke. They’ll put you on whichever side you want to sit on. That’s how it ’s done traditionally. “Usher,” by the way, the word “usher” is also a name of a fa mous singer in the United States.

Any case, going on with the story here, the person in our story said he was a friend of the groom and he sat on the left side bec ause that’s where the friends of the groom and the family of the groom sit. He saw h is friend Ulrich standing at the front of the church with the best man. And so, as it is probably in other countries, the tradition in the United States is th at the man – the person getting married, the groom, usually with another man – a fr iend of his – and that friend and sometimes there’s more than one, but that frien d is called the “best man” – the “best (best) man” – and he is responsible for -   legally, he’s responsible for witnessing the marriage. “To be a witness” (witness ) here means that you sign your name on the government form saying that yes, t his person was married and I was there. “To witness” in general means to obser ve or to see something – usually, something official. Although, it can also be, if you see a crime or an accident, you are a witness to the accident, a witn ess to the crime. Well, there’s no crime here. They’re just getting married and the  best man is a witness. Although, it might be an accident, the wedding, so,  maybe you can use a witness for that as well.

The flower girl and the ring bearer are the first t wo people to walk up the aisle. The “aisle” (aisle) is the center of the church. No w, again, traditionally, the flower girl is a young girl – usually 5, 6, 7, maybe 10, o r 12 years old at most and they are responsible for bringing up flowers for the bri de. The “ring bearer” – and that’s two words – (ring) “ring bearer” which is sp elled (bearer) – a “ring,” of course, is what you put on your hand and the bride and the groom both have rings. “Wedding rings,” we would call them. Well, t he ring bearer brings those rings up to the best man or to the people standing in front, and that again is usually, traditionally a small, young boy – again f our, five, six, maybe 10 or 12

years old. Often it’s a cousin or a younger sister or younger brother, depending on the family.

Well, the “flower girl” and “ring bearer” walked do wn the aisle, and notice, the verb there “to walk down the aisle” – that’s for so me reason, we say that with that particular word “aisle.” So, you walk down, or you could “run down the aisle,” if you were late I guess. And after the ring bearer an d the flower girl, there are the bridesmaids. And the “bridesmaid” is all one word ( bridesmaid). A “maid” – traditionally in English – a “maid” is (maid) – is an unmarried woman, but in a wedding, we use the term “bridesmaid” for any girl or woman that is a friend of the bride and is going to be with her, standing wit h her when she gets married.

I mentioned before that we have the best man and for the woman, we have a “maid of honor.” The “maid of honor” (honor) is her  best friend, the person that she has as her witness. And she is one of the bride smaids. Well, the bride appears, in our story, wearing a beautiful wedding dress, traditionally white dress in American weddings, and she’s walking down the ai sle with her father who was “giving her away.” Again, the tradition is if a wom an is getting married, her father, although sometimes her father and her mother, but t raditionally her father, walks with her and gives her away. Now, it’s kind of a st range expression. When we talk about the verb “to give away” - two words – “g ive away” usually means you’re giving something like you’re giving away you r pen to someone. You’re giving them your pen. But here, we use this very sp ecial case in a wedding. “To give away the bride” means you’re the person that –  the father usually that sort of gives his daughter to the husband, to the man. It’s  very old, very old tradition and some couples do that and some couples don’t do that  anymore.

The bride and groom then, are ready to get married,  finally. And they exchange “vows.” “To exchange (exchange) vows” – two words –  (vows) – “exchange vows” means that they say that they will love the o ther person and they promise to be – we’d say, promise to be faithful. “To be fa ithful” means that you will only be in love with that person and will only be with t hat person, romantically anyway, and this is called a “vow.” And a “vow” is like a p romise that you are making. And the traditional promise, you’ll see in movies and s ome very traditional weddings, the priest or the minister or the rabbi will say, “ John, do you take this woman, Maria, to be your lawfully wedded wife?” “Lawfully”  means legally and “wedded wife” is kind of – just wife would be good enough b ut the expression is a “wedded wife.” And the man says, “I do.” And of course, the  woman is asked the same question. I forgot her name – Maria – “Maria, do yo u take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?” And she says, “I do.” And  then they kiss and it’s all happy, at least for the first couple of days.

At the reception, there is a lot of champagne. “Cha mpagne,” of course, is that special alcoholic beverage – technically comes from  an area in France. But now, people use that word for things that don’t come fro m France – special kind of wine.

The best man makes a toast. A “toast” (toast), you may know, is when you raise your glass. When you lift your glass up and say som ething funny or nice, in this case, embarrassing about the groom or the bride and  groom. But even though this toast embarrassed Ulrich, the groom, “it was a ll in good fun.” “It was all in good fun,” meaning he didn’t mean it in a bad way, it was just for a joke.

Well, at the end of the story, the man talks to his  friend, Ulrich, and he says that Ulrich was trying to set him up with the bridesmaid . “To set someone up” is when you have a friend, for example, and you know anothe r friend – woman – let’s say and you think that those two would be a good couple . So, you say to your friend who’s a man, “I want to introduce you to my friend”  – my female friend, my woman friend – and the idea is that he is setting t hem up. He is helping them get together, to be romantically involved. Well, the ma n in the story says that all married people, want to have all of their friends m arried too. And the story ends with the expression “We’ll see about that.” “We’ll”  (we’ll) – as in we will – “We’ll” or “We will see about that” – that expression means  that the person doesn’t agree or doesn’t want to do whatever is being talke d about and plans on not doing it, or in this case, he plans on not getting married. “We’ll see about that” means I don’t think so. And that is a common expres sion when you want to tell someone that you don’t – you aren’t going to do wha t they want you to do, in this case.

Now let’s listen to the story again, quickly at a n ative rate of speech.

[start of story]

I got an invitation in the mail last month that rea lly surprised me. My friend Ulrich was getting married! We went to college together an d he always said that he’d never get married. I guess he found his dream girl in the end.

The church wedding was going to be at 3 p.m. and the reception would start at 7 p.m. at the reception hall.

I arrived at the church shortly before 3 p.m. and o ne of the ushers asked me if I was a friend of the bride or the groom. I told him that I was a friend of the groom and he sat me on the left side of the church. I saw  Ulrich standing near the front of the church with the best man, and a few minutes later, the pianist started

playing the wedding march. The flower girl and ring  bearer walked down the aisle, followed by the bridesmaid. Then, the bride appeared wearing a beautiful wedding dress, walking with her father who was givi ng her away. The bride and groom exchanged vows and they were married. It was a simple and traditional ceremony.

At the reception, there was a lot of champagne. The  best man made a toast that really embarrassed Ulrich, but it was all in good f un. I got a chance to talk to Ulrich and he seemed really happy. In fact, he was trying to set me up with the bridesmaid. I guess it's true. All married people want to get all of their friends married. We'll see about that!

# Dating Someone's Ex

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 134: Dating Someone’s Ex.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 134. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about going on a date with someo ne’s ex. And here “ex” (ex) means ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend – former boyfri end – someone who used to be your boyfriend or your girlfriend. Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialog]

Marco: Hello.

Claudia: Hey, Marco? It's Claudia. Got a minute?

Marco: Sure. What's up?

Claudia: I'm just wondering what's going on with yo u and Beth. Are you guys still going out?

Marco: We went out for a while, but we never got se rious. Why all the questions? Are you interested in Beth?

Claudia: (Laughs) No, I'm not interested but Shane is. He's been asking me about you guys. He wants to ask her out but he didn 't know whether you guys were still together, or how you’d feel about him as king out your ex.

Marco: Why didn't he just ask me? Beth and I were c asual and we haven't seen each other in months. He should go for it.

Claudia: Okay, I'll tell him. So, if you're not going out with Beth, who's the new girl?

Marco: Wouldn't you like to know. Actually, I've be en seeing a great girl. I'm bringing her to the party on Saturday. You'll meet her then.

Claudia: Great. I'm bringing Lenny so you'll get to  meet him, too. See you Saturday.

Marco: See ya!

[end of dialog]

In this podcast, we meet Claudia and Marco. Claudia  calls Marco on the telephone and Marco answers, “Hello.” And Claudia s ays, “Hey, Marco. It’s Claudia. Got a minute?” “Hey,” (hey) you probably k now is an informal way of saying hello to someone. “Hey, Marco, got a minute? ” means do you have a minute to talk to me. So, if someone says to you, “ Hey, you got a minute?” what they mean is I want to talk to you. Do you have tim e to talk to me right now? Marco says, “Sure. What’s up?” And, of course, “Wha t’s up” again, informal, to mean what’s going on, what is happening, what do yo u want to talk to me about. And Claudia says, “I’m just wondering what’s going on with you and Beth. Are you guys still going out?” The expression “What’s g oing on” here means what is the situation, what is happening between you two. A nd this is sometimes used when there’s a problem. For example, a parent, a fa ther or a mother may see their child crying, and they’ll ask him what’s goin g on or when they see two children fighting, “What’s going on here?” – means what is the problem, why is this happening?

But in this dialog, it’s really just what is the si tuation, what is the – in this case, romantic relationship or no romantic relationship b etween you and Beth. “Are you guys still going out?” “To go out” means here to be  dating, to be romantically interested and involved with someone. Notice the us e of the term “guys” (guys) which again, informal to mean you people. In Englis h, the use of the plural “you” is not very common, at least in American English. S o, when we say “you,” we could mean just one person or we could mean three o r four people. In some dialects, in some variations of American English, w e say, “You all” – that’s a very southern United States expression – “You all.” But most people don’t say that, most people would just say, “you” or informally the y might say, “You guys,” meaning the two of you, in this case, or more.

Well, Marco says that “We went out for a while” – a gain, we dated for a while – “but never got serious.” And “to get serious” if yo u are dating someone, in a relationship – a boyfriend, girlfriend – “to get se rious” means you are thinking about getting married or you are thinking about sta ying together for a long time. Marco then says, “Why all the questions? Are you in terested in Beth?” “Why all the questions” here means why are you asking me the se questions. You want to

know why this person is interested and he makes a j oke by saying, “Are you interested in Beth?”

Well, Claudia is not interested in Beth but she say s that her friend, Shane, is. “Shane has been asking Claudia about you guys” – ag ain, about Marco and Beth. “He wants to ask her out but he didn’t know w hether you guys were still together.” “To ask someone out” means that you are going to ask someone to go on a date with you. So, you ask someone out “on a d ate” – is what we would say – “to ask out,” or “to ask out on a date” and if yo u are interested in each other, then you may start to go out together, meaning you are now dating each other, you are romantically interested in each other. Well , Shane wasn’t sure if Marco and Beth were “still together,” meaning they were s till romantically involved, they were still boyfriend and girlfriend.

Shane was also uncertain about how Marco would feel  about asking out his ex. And again, “ex” (ex) is short for ex-girlfriend, in  this case. It can also mean, when someone says, “your ex” it can also mean your ex-hu sband or your ex-wife – if you divorce from that person. Marco says, “Why didn ’t he just ask me?” In other words, why didn’t Shane ask me directly. “Beth and I,” Marco says, “were casual, and we haven’t seen each other for months.” “To be casual” in this context, means that they weren’t serious, that they weren’t interested in getting married, they were just dating each other. “Casual,” normall y means relaxed, not serious. We also use that expression to talk about clothing.  If somebody says, “Dress is casual for the party,” that means that you don’t ha ve to wear a suit and a tie or very nice clothing. You can dress, you can come in jeans and maybe tennis shoes – that would be dressing casually. Well, Marc o says that Shane should just “go for it.” “To go for it” here means he shou ld do it. There’s a famous advertising line in the U.S. and in other English s peaking countries for Nike – the company Nike that makes tennis shoes, running shoes , and it’s called “Just do it.” And it’s very similar to “go for it,” meaning that you should go ahead, make a decision and, in this case, ask Beth out.

Well, Claudia says that she will tell Shane and the n asks Marco, “Who’s the new girl?” “Who’s the new girl?” meaning who is your new girlf riend. Marco says somewhat again, as a joke, “Wouldn’t you like to know.” That  expression “Wouldn’t you like to know” is when someone asks you a question and wa nts to get information from you, but you don’t think it is any of their co ncern. It’s, we would say, “It’s none of their business,” meaning they don’t need to  know. And usually, it’s when someone is asking you something private or personal , or secret. So, instead of telling the person the answer, you say, “Wouldn’t y ou like to know,” meaning I’m

not going to tell you, it’s none of your business, it’s not your concern. You shouldn’t be interested in it.

But Marco then shows that he is joking when he says , “Actually, I’ve been seeing a great girl.” “To be seeing” means that I am datin g. So, if someone asks you, “Are you seeing anyone?” And it’s the verb “see” (s eeing) – “Are you seeing anyone?” – they mean are you romantically involved,  are you dating anyone. Do you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend? And he says –  Marco says he’s been seeing a great girl and that he’s going to bring her to the party. Claudia says, “Great! I’m bringing Lenny, (her boyfriend) and you’ll get to m eet him, too.”

Notice there seems to be some – we would say – some  romantic or sexual tension between these two, Marco and Claudia. They’ re talking on the telephone, but when we say there seems to be some romantic or sexual “tension” (tension) we mean that they seem to like each other, even tho ugh they each have their own boyfriend or girlfriend, they seem to be intere sted in each other. Well, that’s my interpretation of the dialog. Well, the dialog e nds with Marco saying, “See ya!” And the expression “See ya!” – and here, instead of  saying “You,” we say, “Ya” (ya). It’s just a short, informal way of saying, “Y ou.” So, if somebody says, “See you,” or “See you later” – means I hope that we wil l see each other later.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

Marco: Hello.

Claudia: Hey, Marco? It's Claudia. Got a minute?

Marco: Sure. What's up?

Claudia: I'm just wondering what's going on with yo u and Beth. Are you guys still going out?

Marco: We went out for a while, but we never got se rious. Why all the questions? Are you interested in Beth?

Claudia: (Laughs) No, I'm not interested but Shane is. He's been asking me about you guys. He wants to ask her out but he didn 't know whether you guys were still together, or how you’d feel about him as king out your ex.

Marco: Why didn't he just ask me? Beth and I were c asual and we haven't seen each other in months. He should go for it.

Claudia: Okay, I'll tell him. So, if you're not going out with Beth, who's the new girl?

Marco: Wouldn't you like to know. Actually, I've be en seeing a great girl. I'm bringing her to the party on Saturday. You'll meet her then.

Claudia: Great. I'm bringing Lenny so you'll get to  meet him, too. See you Saturday.

Marco: See ya!

# Scheduling a Meeting

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 135: Scheduling a Meeting.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast number 135. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to learn about how you  set up or schedule a meeting. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

I needed to schedule a meeting for the three depart ments involved in a new project. I called each one to find a date that woul d work for all three of us.

Bruno: So, Nicola, would the day after tomorrow wor k for you?

Nicola: No, I'll be out of the office all day. Coul d we do it early next week or a week from today?

Bruno: I was hoping to schedule it as soon as possi ble. How about the end of this week?

Nicola: Well, I think that's okay. We could meet la te Thursday or Friday. I'm free Thursday from 3 to 5, and on Friday from 10 to 1.

Bruno: Okay. Let me talk to Kumi and I'll let you k now. . Bruno: Hi Kumi, can you make a meeting with Nicola and me this Thursday or Friday?

Kumi: Oh, I wish I could but I'll be in the Boise o ffice starting tomorrow. How about the following week?

Bruno: I think we can do it early next week. Would Monday at 10 work for you?

Kumi: Sure, that's fine.

 Bruno: Let me check with Nicola. You know, I think this would be much easier on email. I'll send Nicola a note and we can confirm o n email.

Kumi: Okay, I'll look for your email.

You know, sometimes, I think scheduling a meeting i s the hardest part of actually having a meeting!

[end of dialog]

In this podcast, we hear a dialog about trying to s chedule a meeting. “To schedule” – as a verb – (schedule) – means that you  are trying to find a day and a time when you can do something. We can use this v erb, for example, to schedule a doctor’s appointment, meaning a time and  a day for you to go see the doctor. You can schedule a meeting, you can schedul e just about any event. Well, in this case, they’re scheduling a meeting be tween, or I should say, among three departments or parts of a company. And the di alog begins by the narrator, Bruno, saying, “I called each one” – each of his fe llow employees, other people who work with him – “to find a date that would work  for us.” A “date” (date) is, for example, February 22nd is a date. And a “day” (day)  is the day of the week, so, Wednesday. So, were trying to find a date that will  work for all three of us.

That expression, “To work for” means that would be good for. So, if someone says to you, “Will Thursday work for you? that mean s is that a good time for you, is that a good day for you. Well, Bruno calls Nicol a on the telephone and says, “Would the day after tomorrow work for you?” “The d ay after tomorrow,” of course, “tomorrow” is the next day, “the day after”  would be two days, so, the day after tomorrow. And Nicola says, “No, I’ll be out of the office all day.” That expression “out of the office” means you will not b e in your office. You’ll be somewhere else, working – we hope – or maybe sleepi ng. “Could we do it,” Nicola says, “Could we do it early next week or a w eek from today?” “Could we do it” here, “to do it” means could we meet “early next week,” so the following week, early next week, or a week from today. So, if  today is Wednesday, the next Wednesday – seven days from or – 8 days I guess, fr om that day, counting the same day.

Bruno says, “Well, I was hoping to schedule it as s oon as possible,” meaning immediately, as fast as I can. There’s also another  expression we use, “A.S.A.P.” If you see that abbreviation or acronym “A.S.A.P” t hat is “as soon as possible.” Somebody says, “I’ll need that A.S.A.P. I need it i mmediately.” Bruno says, “How about the end of this week?” Well, the end of this week will usually be Thursday

or Friday – the end of the week. And of course, the  beginning of the week would be Monday or Tuesday and the middle of the week wou ld be Tuesday, Wednesday, or maybe Thursday. Nicola says that she thinks that’s okay, to meet at the end of the week. “We could meet late Thursda y or Friday,” she says. “Late,” here means later in the day, in the afterno on, 4 o’clock in the afternoon, 5 o’clock – that would be “late in the day.” Well, sh e says she’s free Thursday, from 3 to 5 and Friday from 10 to 1. The expression “I’m  free” (free) means I’m available. I can meet at that time. Someone might s ay, “What time are you free?” “I’m free at 7 P.M.” “I am able to meet you or do s omething at that time.”

Well, Bruno says, he has to talk to Kumi, one of hi s other fellow employees, other workers at the company. So, he calls Kumi and asks her if she can make a meeting this Thursday or Friday. “To make a meeting ” (make) means to be able to go to a movie . “Can you make a meeting on Frida y” means can you go to, will you be available for a meeting on Friday. And Kumi says that “I wish I could,” meaning I would like to. “I wish I could but I’ll b e in the Boise office starting tomorrow.” “Boise” is a city (Boise) in the state of Idaho. Well, “starting tomorrow” – that expression means beginning tomorrow. “Starti ng,” for example “Starting on Tuesday, I will not be in the office” means beginni ng Tuesday, or on Tuesday and the following days, I will not be in the office . So, Kumi recommends, “How about the following week?” meaning how about next w eek. So, if you can’t make it today, can you make it next week and if you can’ t make it next week, how about the following week? So, it’s the week after w hatever week you’re talking about. Bruno says, “I think we can do it early next  week and again, “early” would be Monday or Tuesday and he suggests Monday at 10. “Would Monday at 10 work for you?” And Kumi says, “Sure, that’s fine.” Bruno then says, “Let me check with Nicola.” “To check (check) with someone”  means let me talk to them and make sure it’s okay. Let me communicate with th em to see if that is a good time.

Bruno says, “You know, I think it would be much eas ier on email,” meaning it’ll be much easier for us if we communicate by email or on  email. You can use either “by (by) email,” or “on email.” “I’ll send Nicola a  note and we can confirm on email.” “To confirm” (confirm) means to say yes or no to – “to confirm” means to make sure. For example, we set up a meeting for tom orrow at 7 o’clock and I say, “Well, I will call you this afternoon to confi rm, to make sure that we are still going to be meeting at 7 o’clock. Kumi says, “Okay,  I’ll look for your email.” “I’ll look for” means I’ll be expecting. I will be waitin g for your email. We also use that expression when someone says, “Look for this movie when it comes to your city or your country.” “Look for it” means try to find i t. Be expecting it. Finally, the dialog ends by Bruno saying that “Scheduling a meet ing is the hardest part of actually having a meeting,” and I guess, that’s oft en true.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

# Having a Baby

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 136: Having a Baby.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 136. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development here in beautiful Los Angeles, Californ ia.

On this podcast, we are going to have a baby. Well,  not me. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Patrick: Hey, congratulations! I just heard that yo u're expecting. How far along are you?

Cindy: Thanks. I'm four and a half months pregnant.  It feels like it! I feel huge.

Patrick: You don't look it. I bet Carlos is excited . Do you know yet if it's a boy or a girl?

Cindy: No, we don’t. Not yet. We should be able to find out at my next ultrasound. I don't care what sex the baby is as lo ng as it's healthy. Carlos is really excited about the baby. He has been going wi th me to every prenatal appointment and we'll be taking a Lamaze class toge ther soon.

Patrick: How was your first trimester? When my wife  had our daughter, she had a lot of morning sickness.

Cindy: Oh, it was horrible! I was nauseous all the time, but I'm better now. Did your wife have a natural delivery or a cesarean?

Patrick: She had a natural delivery, but she was in  labor for 12 hours! I was in the delivery room the entire time and wish I had an epi dural, too.

Cindy: Twelve hours! I can't imagine doing that.

Patrick: Don't think about it. I'm sure you'll have  an easy delivery. Let me know when the baby shower will be.

Cindy: Thanks. I will.

 [end of dialog]

Well, in today’s podcast, we talk about someone hav ing a baby. Patrick talks to his friend Cindy and he says, “I just heard that yo u’re expecting.” “To be expecting,” for a woman, means that she is going to  have a baby, that she is pregnant. She is, we might say, “with child,” meani ng she has a child, or is going to have a baby. Now, this is a special verb “to be expecting.” It can also be used – that expression can also mean – just to be waitin g for something. “I am expecting a package from my brother.” But if we wan t to say someone is having a baby - and talking about a woman – then you can s ay “to be expecting.” It’s important to point out here that, although “to be e xpecting” comes from the verb “to expect,” you cannot say “She expects” – that do esn’t mean the same as she is expecting. You have to use “to be,” the verb “to  be” plus expecting to mean having a baby.

Well, the next question that Patrick asks Cindy is,  “How far along are you?” “How far along (along) are you? – that means how many mo nths pregnant are you. How soon will it be before you have your baby? – be fore you give birth, we would say. “To give birth” (birth) means to have a baby f or a woman. And Cindy says, “I’m four and a half months pregnant,” meaning she’ s been pregnant for four and a half months. So, the baby is four and a half mont hs in her – the expression we might use is “in her womb.” “Womb” (womb) is where the baby is before it is born.

Well, she is four and a half months pregnant and Pa trick says, “You don’t look it” and asks if they know if it’s going to be a boy or a girl. And Cindy says that they don’t know. They will be able to find out at her ne xt “ultrasound.” An “ultrasound” (ultrasound) is when the doctor is able to use a sp ecial machine and it’s sort of like taking a picture of the baby inside the womb. And you get to see the outline of the baby and, of course, if you see the baby in the picture and the baby is developed enough, you will tell whether it’s a boy or a girl. And if you don’t know how to tell a boy versus a girl, then this is not t he podcast for you.

Now, Cindy says that her husband, Carlos, has been very supportive – has helped her – and he has gone to every prenatal appo intment. A “prenatal” – all one word – (prenatal) – means before the baby is bo rn. So, we talk about, for example, “prenatal medical care” – it means the med ical assistance, the medical care a woman gets before her baby is born.

Cindy also mentions that she and her husband are ta king a “Lamaze class” together. “Lamaze” – which is (Lamaze) – is a metho d where women – usually

they go to a class when they’re pregnant and they l earn how to breathe in a certain way, so when they are ready to give birth, to have their baby, the delivery is a little easier. And “Lamaze” was actually, I th ink, a French – the name of a French doctor from the 19th century – from the 1800 s. Well, Patrick says, “How was your first trimester?” Typically, a baby takes 9 months to be born and we divide those 9 months into 3 parts and we call each  part, a “trimester” –  “tri” (trimester). You might have heard the expression “s emester” (semester) – that’s when you divide something in two. A “trimester” is when you divide something in 3. So, the first trimester would be the first 3 mon ths of the pregnancy.

Patrick says that when he and his wife had their da ughter – well, the wife actually had the daughter, Patrick just watched, well, he he lped, of course. Well, his wife, Patrick’s wife, had “morning sickness.” Now, you kn ow what morning is and you know what sickness is, but when someone says “morni ng sickness” – this is what happens to some women when they are pregnant, espec ially during the first part of their pregnancy. When they wake up in the mornin g, they sometimes feel sick; although, I am told that some women are sick throug hout their nine months of their pregnancy or many months of their pregnancy. And that, of course, is not very fun, but it’s part of the body’s response to t he pregnancy. And Cindy says that her morning sickness was horrible. She was “na useous” all the time. “To be nauseous” (nauseous) means to feel sick like you are going to well, the word we would use is “throw up” – two words – “throw up.” “ To throw up” means the same as to “vomit” (vomit) which means, what’s in your s tomach comes out your mouth. I know it’s not a very nice thing to talk ab out, but that’s what “to be nauseous” means, you feel like you’re going to thro w up.

“Did your wife have a natural delivery or a caesare an?” Cindy asks Patrick. “Did your wife have a natural delivery?” The delivery is  when the baby is born. The baby is “delivered” if you will. Well, a natural de livery means that the baby was born the regular – the normal way. The other possib ility is a caesarean. And “caesarean” spelled (caesarean) – we also sometimes  say a “caesarean section” (section) – two words – “caesarean section” means t hat the baby is removed – is taken out of the womb by cutting open a hole in the  womb and taking the baby out, rather than having it come out naturally. “Cae sarean” comes from – there’s an old story that Julius Caesar and Julius Caesar w as the first emperor of Rome, of ancient Rome 2000 years ago, that Julius Caesar was born this way. Although that’s almost certainly not a true story because hi s mother survived his childbirth, her childbirth rather, and that probably would not have happened if it had been a true caesarean section. But enough of history.

Patrick says, “She was in labor for 12 hours.” His wife was in “labor.” “To be in labor” – two words – (in labor) – means that you are preparing to have your baby

and it’s a time when the baby starts to come out of  the womb and it can last a few hours, it can last 10 hours, it can last a long  time. And it’s often the woman is in pain during that time. In fact, so much pain tha t sometimes the doctors give them a certain pain killer – a drug to lower the pa in, and that’s called an “epidural.” “Epidural” (epidural) is the way that t hey administer – they give you the drug – through an epidural. My mother had 11 ch ildren. I am the youngest, as some of you know. And I don’t think she had any epi durals back then.

Well, Patrick says that he wants to know when Cindy  and her husband are having the “baby shower.” A “baby shower” and “show er” (shower) – well “shower” normally means rain. But a “baby shower” i s a party that you have usually before the baby is born and you go to the h ouse of the person who’s having the party and you give a gift to the mother and the father. Traditionally, only women go to baby showers, but in the last few years, several years really, in the last probably, 25, 30 years, it’s now more comm on for both men and women to go to this baby shower.

Well, now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at  a native rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

Patrick: Hey, congratulations! I just heard that yo u're expecting. How far along are you?

Cindy: Thanks. I'm four and a half months pregnant.  It feels like it! I feel huge.

Patrick: You don't look it. I bet Carlos is excited . Do you know yet if it's a boy or a girl?

Cindy: No, we don’t. Not yet. We should be able to find out at my next ultrasound. I don't care what sex the baby is as lo ng as it's healthy. Carlos is really excited about the baby. He has been going wi th me to every prenatal appointment and we'll be taking a Lamaze class toge ther soon.

Patrick: How was your first trimester? When my wife  had our daughter, she had a lot of morning sickness.

Cindy: Oh, it was horrible! I was nauseous all the time, but I'm better now. Did your wife have a natural delivery or a cesarean?

Patrick: She had a natural delivery, but she was in  labor for 12 hours! I was in the delivery room the entire time and wish I had an epi dural, too.

# Meeting an Out of Town Friend.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 137: Meeting an Out of Town Friend.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 137. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to meet an old friend.  Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Lucy: Hey Jeff, have you met my friend?

Jeff: No, I don't think I have.

Lucy: Well, this is my oldest and best friend, Marl ene. She's visiting from out of town.

Jeff: Hi, I'm Jeff.

Marlene: Hi, it's nice meeting you.

Jeff: How long do you plan to be in town?

Marlene: I'm here for the long weekend, staying wit h Lucy. We're doing some catching up and I'm getting a break from work.

Jeff: Oh, what line of work are you in? Are you in the same field as Lucy?

Marlene: No, I'm in medicine. I'm a doctor, actuall y, a pediatrician. I enjoy the work, but it's nice to get away for a few days. Wha t kind of work do you do?

Jeff: I work in the education field, but what I rea lly want to do is to become a professional singer.

Lucy: Jeff has a great voice. He sounds exactly lik e Frank Sinatra.

Marlene: Really?

Jeff: No, she's just kidding and Lucy knows that I can't sing. We went to a karaoke bar once and people actually offered me money NOT to sing.

Lucy: That was a lot of fun. We should do that agai n sometime.

Jeff: Sure, anytime. Oh, I'd better go. It was nice  meeting you Marlene, and Lucy, I'll talk to you next week.

Marlene: Nice to meet you, too.

Lucy: Okay, later.

[end of dialog]

In this podcast, we are meeting an out-of-town frie nd. When we say someone is “out of town” (town) we mean they are from somewher e other than where you live. So, if you live in Los Angeles, an out of tow n friend could be from San Francisco or New York City, or Houston, Texas – tho se would all be out of town friends, if they were coming to visit you. The dial og begins with Lucy saying to Jeff, “Have you met my friend?” “Have you met” (met ) – of course, that’s the past tense of “to meet” – so, is this someone that you h ave met? You met them last week or two years ago. And I say, “No, I haven’t. I  don’t think I have.” And Lucy says that this is her “oldest and best friend, Marl ene.” When we use the term “oldest” when we’re talking about friends, we don’t  normally mean older in terms of age like I’m 29 and my friend is 50. And he’s my  oldest friend in age. That’s not what we normally mean. We normally mean this is  one of the friends that I have known for the longest time – period of time – 10 years, 20 years, and so forth.

Well, Lucy says that she is visiting from out of to wn and then I introduce myself and I say, “Hi. I’m Jeff.” And she responds by sayi ng, “Hi. It’s nice meeting you.” It’s nice meeting you is the same as “It’s nice to meet you.” It’s what we would say to someone the first time we meet them, but onl y the first time. And I say to Marlene – her friend – “How long do you plan to be in town?” meaning how many days or how many weeks will you be visiting this pl ace. Notice the expression “in town.” When we say someone is “in town,” again, we mean they’re in the city or the place where you live. So, they would respond by  saying, “I’m in town for three weeks” –means I will be here for three weeks – so, “out of town” and “in town.” Well, Marlene says that she’s here for a long weeke nd and when we say a “long (long) weekend,” we mean, usually, three or four da ys and that could be Friday, Saturday and Sunday or Thursday, Friday, Saturday a nd Sunday – possibly even

Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Remember in the United  States we like to have our national holidays on Mondays so we can have a l ong weekend.

Well, she’s staying – Marlene is staying with Lucy.  And “to stay with someone” means that they are sleeping at their house or thei r apartment. She says that she wants to do some “catching up” and get a break from  work. “To do some catching up” here means that she wants to talk to some of he r friends that she hasn’t talked to in a long time, find out how they are doi ng. She wants to get a “break (break) from work” which means the same as – basica lly a vacation from work. A time when I don’t have to work would be a break.

I asked Marlene, “What line of work are you in?” “W hat line (line) of work are you in?” And that means what do you do for a living? What is your profession? What is your job, your occupation? You could be a lawyer , for example. You could be a truck driver – that would be your line of work. So,  when we ask someone, “What is your line of work?” or “What line of work are yo u in?” – that is what we’re asking and I ask Marlene also, “Are you in the same  field (field) as Lucy?” A “field” is just another way of saying the same prof ession, the same type of work. It does not mean the same company necessarily – jus t means the same kind of work or the same type of work. And Marlene says tha t she’s not in the same field as Lucy. She’s “in medicine.” “I’m in medicine” mea ns I work in the medical field. I do my job – my job is related to medicine. You ca n say, “Well, I’m in the legal profession,” or “My job is in law (law)” – that wou ld be someone who was a lawyer, for example. And she, in this case, is in m edicine and says that she’s a “pediatrician.” And “pediatrician” is a long word –  pediatrician) is someone who works with children and usually, in the United Stat es, a pediatrician works with babies, children – usually up to the age of about 1 7 or so. So, they could work with children and teenagers – that would be a pedia trician.

She says she enjoys her work but “it’s nice to get away for a few days.” “To get away” means to take a short vacation somewhere else , somewhere not in your home town. To go to say, Las Vegas, and lose all of  your money by gambling, because, of course, in Las Vegas, it’s a famous pla ce to gamble your money in the United States and, what a great way to spend yo ur time, losing all of your money.

Anyway, Marlene doesn’t go to Vegas, she goes – com es to Los Angeles. Marlene asked me, “What kind of work do you do?” – meaning very much the same as what line of work are you in – what kind of  work do you do. And I say that I’m in the education field but, of course, my real goal is to become a professional singer. Lucy then says that I have a g reat voice – that I sound just like Frank Sinatra. Frank Sinatra, you probably kno w, is a famous American

singer from the 1940’s and 50’s and 60’s, who has a  very beautiful voice. Of course, Lucy is joking and I say, “She’s just kiddi ng,” meaning Lucy is just kidding (kidding) – means she’s just joking. She’s just mak ing a joke. I then say that once, we went to a karaoke bar. A “karaoke bar” is a place, you probably know, that you can sing songs and they put the lyrics, the words to the song. And you stand up in front of everyone else and you have a c ouple of beers – very important – and then you start singing. And usually , it’s pretty bad. And it was originally – very popular in Japan and then became popular in the United States and other countries as well. And I’m sure that’s no t the pronunciation in Japan, but in English we say “karaoke.”

Well, Lucy says, “We should go to a karaoke bar aga in.” And I say, “Sure, anytime.” But, of course, I don’t want to go back. Then I say, “It was nice meeting you Marlene” – which is again the same with “It’s n ice to meet you.” But when you first meet someone, in the United States, when you’re leaving, when you’re about to leave that person that you just met, you w ould say, “It was nice to meet you.” And she says, “Nice to meet you too,” meaning  it was also nice for me to meet you. Lucy ends the dialog by saying, “Okay. La ter.” And this is an informal expression you hear, especially among younger speak ers. Somebody says, “Later” – means I’ll see you later – will talk to y ou later.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time a t a native rate of speech.

Lucy: Hey Jeff, have you met my friend?

Jeff: No, I don't think I have.

Lucy: Well, this is my oldest and best friend, Marl ene. She's visiting from out of town.

Jeff: Hi, I'm Jeff.

Marlene: Hi, it's nice meeting you.

Jeff: How long do you plan to be in town?

Marlene: I'm here for the long weekend, staying wit h Lucy. We're doing some catching up and I'm getting a break from work.

Jeff: Oh, what line of work are you in? Are you in the same field as Lucy?

Marlene: No, I'm in medicine. I'm a doctor, actuall y, a pediatrician. I enjoy the work, but it's nice to get away for a few days. Wha t kind of work do you do?

Jeff: I work in the education field, but what I rea lly want to do is to become a professional singer.

Lucy: Jeff has a great voice. He sounds exactly lik e Frank Sinatra.

Marlene: Really?

Jeff: No, she's just kidding and Lucy knows that I can't sing. We went to a karaoke bar once and people actually offered me money NOT to sing.

Lucy: That was a lot of fun. We should do that agai n sometime.

# Hotel Tour Desk

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 138: Hotel Tour Desk.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 138. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to be talking about ma king a reservation in a hotel to take a tour. Let’s go!

[start of dialog]

Sam: Hi, is this where I can get information on tou rs?

Nan: Yes, I can help you with that. What type of to ur are you thinking about? There are some great city tours that are half-day o r full- day.

Sam: You know, we've explored the city a lot since we've been here. I was actually thinking of a side trip.

Nan: Oh, sure. We have excursions to nearby attract ions. There are one-day trips or two-day overnight trips, depending on whic h one you pick.

Sam: I think I'm interested in a hiking trip to the  mountains. I'm big on nature. Are the overnight trips expensive?

Nan:  Not at all. They are very moderately priced, starting at $120 and up. Here's a brochure on the three hiking tours that are avail able. All three are guided tours, and meals and transportation are included.

Sam: Do I need to book ahead?

Nan: Yes, this company requires that you make a res ervation 24 hours ahead.

Sam: Great. I'll take a look at the brochure. Can I  book that here at the hotel tour desk, or do I call the company directly?

Nan: I can book that for you. Just stop by when you 've made a decision and I'll take care of it for you.

Sam: That's great. Thanks a lot for your help.

Nan: It's my pleasure. Let me know if you have any questions.

Sam: I will. Thanks.

[end of dialog] In this podcast, we are at a hotel and we are talki ng to the person who works at the tour desk – the place where you can go in a goo d hotel to reserve a tour. A “tour” (tour) can be anything from a couple of hour s to a couple of weeks. A “tour” is a general term we use for – usually for when som eone takes you somewhere and serves as your, we would call “guide” (guide) –  and they’re called “the tour guide.” And that’s the person who knows all of the information and tells you the information and takes care of all of the arrangemen ts that you need when you are travelling.

In the dialog, Sam asks Nan – the person working at  the tour desk – if this is the place to get information on tours. She says it is, and asked “What kind of tour are you thinking about?” What are you planning? “There are some great city tours that are half-day and full-day,” she says. A “city tour” (city) – a “city tour,” of course, would be a tour of whatever city you are in . So, here in Los Angeles, the city tour would take you to the beach. It would tak e you to Hollywood and so forth.

A “half-day tour” (half-day) – “half-day,” of cours e, would be four hours usually – three to four hours. So, from eight in the morning until 12 noon or from one in the afternoon until five PM – that would be a half day tour. And a “full-day tour,” of course would be the entire eight hours or 10 hours.  Sometimes, you go in a tour. It can last as much, a day tour of 12 hours.

Well, Sam says that they’ve explored the city and s o he doesn’t want to take a city tour. To say “We have explored (explored) the city” means we’ve already looked around at the things to see here in the city . “To explore” usually means to go somewhere where very few people or no one has go ne before, and we talk about the great explorers – people who went places where no one had gone before them. But here, as a verb, “to explore” just  means to look at, to visit different places.

Sam says he’s actually thinking of a “side trip.” A  “side (side) trip” – two words – would be, for example, you go to a big city like Lo s Angeles, but you want to travel down to see San Diego, which is about 2 hour s from here, driving. So, you go down to San Diego, then you come back to Los Ang eles, and stay in Los

Angeles some more time. So, San Diego is a “side tr ip.” It’s a trip you take from the place where you are visiting.

Nan says that “We have excursions to nearby attract ions.” An “excursion” (excursion) is usually, a short trip to somewhere, to some interesting place, usually, less than one day. So, we’re going to take  an excursion to the Los Angeles Zoo, for example, to see the animals and the actors. We keep the actors in cages in a zoo here. I’m just kidding. We should , but we don’t.

So, you take an excursion to the zoo – that would b e a short trip – or an excursion to the beach. An “attraction” (attraction ) – an “attraction” is just an interesting place to visit, usually for someone who  is a tourist. And, of course a “tourist” (tourist) is someone who is visiting – so meone who is on vacation. And attractions could be, for example, Disneyland – cou ld be an attraction. Venice Beach is an attraction – any place that’s interesti ng to visit is an attraction. The tour person also says that they have overnight trip s. And of course, an “overnight (overnight) trip” is when you go somewhere and you stay at a hotel, maybe for one or two nights and then you come back to the hot el where you are staying. So, a side trip could be an overnight trip as well.

Sam says that he’s interested in a “hiking trip.” A nd “to hike” (hike) is to walk – usually in the mountains or somewhere out away from  the city. He says that he’s “big on nature.” To say you are “big (big) on somet hing” is an informal expression. It just means that you like it a lot. “ I am big on singing.” I like to sing – not very well, but I am big on it. I like it. I enj oy it.

Sam asks if the tours are expensive and the tour op erator – we would probably call her, or the tour desk person – says that they are moderately priced. When we say something is “moderately (moderately) priced  (priced)” – to say something is “moderately priced” means it’s not exp ensive but it’s not “cheap” (cheap) either. “To be cheap” means to be very inex pensive – not to cost very much money. So, it’s not a lot of money, but it’s n ot a little money either. It’s somewhere in between – moderately priced.

The prices of the tours, according to the tour desk  person, are “$120 and up.” When we use the expression with money, “and up” (up ), we mean that it can be more expensive. It can cost more money. So, “The to urs are $120 and up” means the cheapest tour, the least expensive tour, is $120, but there are more expensive tours also available - $140, $160 and so forth. So, the expression “and up” is used when you’re giving the lowest price of something but also telling the person that there are more expensive items or thing s that you are selling.

The person – Nan – then gives Sam a brochure, and a  “brochure” (brochure) is a piece of paper – sometimes with pictures on it, som etimes it’s folded, and it gives you information about something that you are intere sted in buying. Usually – often we use brochures for tours, travel tours, so people can see pictures of where they are going to be visiting, get informatio n about how long the tour lasts and so forth. You can also have a brochure for some thing you are selling. You’re selling, for example – if you are going to buy a ca r and you go to the place where they sell cars – what we would call a “car dealersh ip” or a “car dealer” (dealer), someone who sells new cars – you can get a brochure  about the car that will give you pretty pictures and information about it.

Nan says that all of the tours they have are “guide d” tours – (guided) – “guided tours” and “to be guided” means, we’ve said before,  that the person who runs the tour is the tour guide. Well, a “guided tour” is a tour that has someone who is in charge – someone who is giving you information and is the person who works for the tour company. Sam asks if he needs to “book ahe ad.” “To book,” (book) you probably know, means to make a reservation, to rese rve. And “to book ahead” (ahead) means to make a reservation in advance – a day before or two days before you are going to go.

Nan says that “You do need do make a reservation 24  hours ahead.” Sam says, “Can I book here or do I call the company – the tou r company – directly?” When we say, “I’m going to call them directly” (directly ) we mean I’m going to call their headquarters. I’m going to call their company and make a reservation with the home or the main office. Nan says, “No. You can mak e the reservation here at the hotel. Just stop by when you’ve made a decision .” “To stop (stop) by (by)” – two words – means to go somewhere and in this case,  to go back to the tour desk and give the information. So, “to stop by” mea ns to return or to go somewhere for a short period of time.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

Sam: Hi, is this where I can get information on tou rs?

Nan: Yes, I can help you with that. What type of to ur are you thinking about? There are some great city tours that are half-day o r full- day.

# Job Layoffs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 139: Job Layoffs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 139. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to learn about people who, unfortunately, may lose their jobs. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Phillip: So, have you heard the news?

Mary: No, what's up?

Phillip: I just heard that the company is planning to lay off 20 percent of the employees in the next two months.

Mary: You're kidding! I knew they were looking for some way to cut costs with the lower profits this quarter, but I didn't think that   they would start laying people off.

Phillip: Yeah, it's hard to believe. That'll be hun dreds of people losing their jobs. It's not just the salary. It means losing benefits,  too. You know, I hope it's not going to be Sebastian. With three kids and a wife w ho's sick, that would really be a blow.

Mary: When will we know who's getting axed?

Phillip: I don't know if we'll get any warning. We might just get a pink slip on a Friday afternoon. Well, I'm going to start job hunt ing right now.

Mary: That's a good idea. The first thing I'm going  to do is to call all of my friends and business contacts to let them know I'm on the m arket. Hopefully, I'll get a line on something soon. Thanks for letting me know.

Phillip: Sure. If I hear anything else, I'll let yo u know.

Mary: Thanks. I'll do the same.

[end of dialog]

Today’s podcast is about job layoffs. And a “layoff ” is when a company fires some of its employees. “It lets them go” is another  expression we may use. So, “a layoff” is basically when you lose your job. The  dialog begins with Philip saying, “Have you heard the news?” – meaning have y ou heard the piece of information – important piece of information. Someb ody says, “Have you heard the news?” means do you know about this important n ews. And Mary says, “No. What’s up?” “What’s up” means, of course, what is g oing on? What is happening? And Philip says that he heard the compan y that they work for is planning to “lay off” twenty percent of the employe es. “To lay off” is, of course, the verb (lay off) – two words – “to lay off” is the verb for letting someone go – someone firing someone. Mary says, “You’re kidding, ” meaning, of course, you’re joking. She doesn’t believe him. She says, “I thoug ht they were looking for some way to cut costs with the lower profits this quarte r but I didn’t think they would start laying people off.” She says, “I knew they we re looking for some way to cut costs.” “To cut (cut) costs (costs)” is to reduce o r to lower the amount of money that the company spends. What they spend are their costs. The opposite of costs would be their “income” or their “profit” – the money they make.

Well, they’re trying to cut costs because they have  lower profits this quarter. “Lower” means less. We talk about lower profits, hi gher profits. “Profits” (profits) is the money that a company makes. It’s the money t hey make, the income they receive minus the costs. So, for example, if a comp any sells an automobile, a car, that costs $20,000 and the price is $20,000 bu t it only cost the company $10,000 to make the car, they make a $10,000 profit . I’m not good at the math here, I guess. Anyway, they lower their profits – t hey’ve had lower profits – the company has – this “quarter.” And “quarter” (quarte r) – when we talk about business is three months. And there are four quarte rs in a year. And normally, those are numbered, 1st quarter, 2nd quarter, 3rd q uarter, 4th quarter –so the first three months, the second three months, and so  forth.“Quarter,” of course, means 25 percent of something and in the United Sta tes, the 25 cent coin is called a “quarter.”

Well, Philip says that it’s hard to believe that th ey are going to lay off people. He says that “Hundreds of people will be losing their jobs,” meaning, of course, they’re going to be fired. “It’s not just the salar y,” Philip says, “it means losing benefits too.” Your “salary” (salary) is the money that the company gives you. It is your pay every week or every two weeks or every mon th, however often you are paid. “Benefits” (benefits) are things like health insurance and life insurance – those would be examples of benefits – vacation time  – those are all part of things

that the company pays for but it’s not money. It’s something other than money that they give you like insurance or maybe free cof fee. I don’t know.

Philip goes on to say that he’s worried about one of his co-workers, one of the people that he works with, Sebastian, because he ha s three kids, three children. And if he lost his job, that would be a real “blow. ” A “blow” (blow) – as a noun – usually means when you hit someone. If you say, “Bo y, that was a blow” means – here it would mean that was a very bad thing, a v ery negative thing – something that would hurt them – not necessarily ph ysically but financially – in terms of money.

Mary asks when the employees will find out – will k now – who’s getting “axed.” “To get axed” (axed) is an informal way of saying g etting fired, being laid off. You can say, “I am being axed,” or “I was axed.” You ca n also say, “I got the axe.” “I got the axe” is the same as “I was axed.” “I was fi red.” Well, Philip says that he doesn’t know if they’ll get any warning – meaning a ny advance notice – they’ll tell them before they actually fire them. He says, “We m ight get a pink slip on Friday afternoon.” A “pink (pink) slip (slip)” is a tradit ional way of saying – a notice that you are being fired. We call that a “pink slip.” the idea is that the piece of paper that gave you the bad news about losing your job wa s on a pink piece of paper. But really, no one knows exactly where that term co mes from. There are different opinions – different languages have similar express ions. I believe in German, there’s something like a blue letter. And if you ge t a blue letter that means you are being fired. So, I’m not really sure where that  term comes from. But a “pink slip,” everyone understands, means that you are bei ng fired. And to get a “pink slip” means that you are getting axed.

Well, Philip says, he’s going to start “job hunting ” right now. “To job hunt” – two words – to “job hunt” means to look for a job. “Hun ting” normally is when you go and you shoot animals or people, if you’re the vice  president of the United States. And “job hunting” is what you do when you are looki ng for a job. Mary says that it’s a good idea and that she is going to call all of her friends and business contacts. A “contact” (contacts) is a term that we use in business to mean a person I know – someone who I know – usually at a p articular company. So, you might say, “I have a contact at IBM” or “I have a c ontact in the Mayor’s Office” – something like that. It’s a person that you can cal l – person that you can contact. The verb “to contact” means to communicate, to talk  to someone. Mary’s going to let her contacts know that she is on the market. “T o be on the market” (market) means you are looking for the job, or a job, rather . “I’m on the market.” A thing can also be “on the market.” We say, “The car is on  the market” means the car is being sold – they’re trying to sell it. But for a p erson, it means you are looking for a job.

 Mary says that she “hopes to get a line on somethin g soon.” “To get a line (line) on something,” means that she will get some informa tion that will help her find a job about a particular or specific company. So, we would use this expression in many different ways. ”I have a line on a good used car” means I know someone who is selling a used car. I haven’t bought it yet,  but I have a line on it.

Mary then says, “Thanks for letting me know.” “To l et (let) someone know” means to tell them. If someone says to you, “Let me know when you are going to leave.” They’re saying, “Tell me when you are going to leav e.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

Phillip: So, have you heard the news?

Mary: No, what's up?

Phillip: I just heard that the company is planning to lay off 20 percent of the employees in the next two months.

Mary: You're kidding! I knew they were looking for some way to cut costs with the lower profits this quarter, but I didn't think that  they would start laying people off.

# Buying on the Internet

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 140: Buying on the Internet.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 140. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to talk about buying s omething over, or on, the Internet. Let’s get started! > It's true that I don't like shopping. When I want t o buy something, I do it online. I like buying on the Internet because I can easily do  some comparison shopping and find the best price. It's easy, too.
> Last week I wanted to buy some new headphones. I di d a search and found a pair on sale at a store in New Jersey. I read the p roduct description and knew that this was the right one. I added it to my shopp ing cart and I was ready to check out. The screen showed that I had one item in  my basket and that it was in stock. I had a choice of shipping and I picked stan dard shipping for $5.95, rather than the expedited shipping for $12.95. I clicked t he "continue" button and filled in my shipping address and my billing address. Then , it took me to the payment screen and I typed in my credit card number and exp iration date. I clicked the "Purchase" button and I was done. I got a confirmat ion page with a tracking number. I checked the next day and it showed that m y item had already been shipped.
> Buying on the Internet is perfect for someone like me. Now, if only finding a girlfriend was just that easy.

We are shopping on the Internet today, buying thing s on the Internet. And our story begins with the narrator, the person telling the story, saying that when they buy things, they like to do it “online.” “Online” ( online) means buying something on the Internet – it’s the same as being on the Int ernet, being online. The person likes to buy on the Internet and you can also say b uy “over the Internet,” but “on” is probably now a little more common. This person l ikes buying on the Internet

because they can do some comparison shopping. “Comp arison shopping” (comparison) is when you can compare or look at two  different stores or three different stores or ten different stores and see wh ich store has the cheapest price. That’s comparison shopping, looking at diffe rent stores and getting their prices.

Well, last week, the narrator wanted to buy some ne w headphones. “Headphones” – all one word – are those things you put on your ears – that cover your ears – to listen to music or podcast or whatev er you want to. We usually say “headphones” – that sometimes – word – get’s used a lso for the types of earphones that go into your – adjust into your ear.  They don’t cover your whole ear. We often call those “ear buds” (buds). “Ear bu ds,” like the iPod has white ear buds. But a headphone, the old type of headphone is  the one that covers your whole ear and we usually say this is a “pair” of he adphones. A “pair of headphones,” because, of course, there are two and two is a pair (pair). Well, he finds a pair of headphones at a store in New Jersey . New Jersey is a state on the east coast of the United States right next to New Y ork –the state of New York.” He reads the product description and knows that it’ s the right one. The “product description” when you buy something on an Internet store, there’ll usually be some sort of sentence or paragraph that gives you m ore information about the product. A “product” (product) is just the thing th at you are buying. So, the product is whatever you are buying. The product des cription will have a description of what you are interested in.

This person knew that it was the “right one” or the  “correct one,” meaning it’s the one that he wants. So, the first thing he does is h e “adds it to his shopping cart.” This is an electronic shopping cart. A “shopping ca rt” – “shopping cart” are two words – (cart) – “shopping cart” is normally, in a store like a grocery store – a supermarket – it’s what you push, that you put all of your food into this big – it’s like a big basket that has wheels on it and you can  push it. But in an Internet store, the shopping cart is where you put things th at you want to buy and you can put things in your shopping cart and if you change your mind, you can take them out again. So, it’s like a place where the Internet  store holds the things that you are interested in buying. And normally on a website , on an Internet store, you can click on a button that says, “Shopping Cart” and th at will tell you what you plan on buying, what you have decided to buy.

When you’re ready to buy, then you “check out” – tw o words – (check) out. “To check out” means to purchase or to buy the product,  to actually now decide that you’re going to buy it and you make that decision, then you check out and again, you’ll often see a button on an Internet store that  says, “check out” – that’s what you do when you want to finish and go ahead and buy  what you want. Well,

when the person looked at their shopping cart, in t he story, the screen showed or the computer screen showed that they had one item –  he had one time in his basket. And it was “in stock.” An “item” (item) is similar to a product. It’s the thing that you are going to buy – the individual product that you are going to buy. You can say, for example, that the product is an iPod a nd you could have two iPods. So, you have two of the same item or two of the sam e product.

Your “basket” (basket) is the same as your shopping  cart. So, If you say, “I have one item in my basket,” that’s the same as one item  in my shopping cart – the place that holds the things I’m thinking of buying.  And the item is “in stock.” We say something is “in stock” – two words – “stock” i s (stock) – that means that the store actually has the product. So, if you’re buyin g an iPod and it says it’s “in stock,” that means they actually have the iPod and can send it to you. If it says it’s “out of stock” – “out of stock” means they don ’t have any. So, sometimes you’ll go to a store and you’ll say, “Oh, I want to  buy a certain product, a certain item.” And they say, “Oh, I’m sorry. It’s out of st ock,” meaning we don’t have any left to sell.

In the story, the person buying the headphones has a choice of shipping and “shipping” (shipping) means sending the package – t wo ways – that they can have the package sent to them. A “package” (package ) is the box or whatever it is that you are buying, they put it in something, a nd then they ship it or mail it – send it to you. So, there are two possibilities, on e is standard shipping and another is expedited shipping. “Standard shipping” is the normal or regular shipping and here in the United States, if you buy on an Internet store, standard shipping is usually something that takes five to se ven days for you to get it – that would be standard shipping. “Expedited shipping” (e xpedited) – “expedited” – that’s when you are going to pay more money and the y will send it faster. They will use a faster way of sending it to you. So, it again, used in  the United States as an example, we have a service called “priority m ail.” “Priority mail” means that you’ll get it in two or three days instead of five to seven days. You can also have something sent overnight with a special service. An d the service or cost, of course, more money  – that is expedited shipping.

Well, the person here clicks the continue button, m eaning they decide what they want for shipping and then they fill in or type in,  put in, their shipping address and their billing address. The “shipping address” is, of course, where you want the company to send your product, to send your package,  your item. The “billing address” (billing) – “billing address” – that’s whe re, if you are paying by a credit card, for example, that’s where you get your credit  card bill. And when you buy something on the Internet, in the United States at least, the company that is selling you the item, they will check electronicall y, to make sure that you have the

correct address for your credit card. And if you pu t in the wrong address, then it will reject your credit card. So, if you buy someth ing and you live in the United States or Canada and you buy from a store in the Un ited States or Canada, you have to put a correct billing address. If you buy i nternationally, for example, if you are in Japan and you want to buy something from a s tore here in the United States, there is, I don’t think any way that most of the companies can check your address. So, it’s a little less important but you s till have to put in a billing address.

Well, the person in the story types in their billin g address and they click the “purchase” button. And “to purchase” (purchase) mea ns to buy. When they buy it, they get a confirmation page. And the “confirmation  page” just says, “Yes, you bought this.” It’s proof that you bought this item on our store. And you will often get a “tracking number.” A “tracking number” (track ing) number – two words – that is a number that you can track or check your p ackage to see where it is and the major mail services in the United States delive ry services – companies that will deliver or send you a package. You can put in a number. They give you a number that you can then type into the computer – i nto the Internet and it will tell you where your package is and if it is going to arr ive at your house or business on time, on the right day. So, it’s a way of findin g out about where your package is and how long it will take to get to you – that’s  a tracking number.

Well, let’s listen to the story again, this time at  a native rate of speech.

It's true that I don't like shopping. When I want t o buy something, I do it online. I like buying on the Internet because I can easily do  some comparison shopping and find the best price. It's easy, too.

Last week I wanted to buy some new headphones. I di d a search and found a pair on sale at a store in New Jersey. I read the p roduct description and knew that this was the right one. I added it to my shopp ing cart and I was ready to check out. The screen showed that I had one item in  my basket and that it was in stock. I had a choice of shipping and I picked stan dard shipping for $5.95, rather than the expedited shipping for $12.95. I clicked t he "continue" button and filled in my shipping address and my billing address. Then , it took me to the payment screen and I typed in my credit card number and exp iration date. I clicked the "Purchase" button and I was done. I got a confirmat ion page with a tracking number. I checked the next day and it showed that m y item had already been shipped.

Buying on the Internet is perfect for someone like me. Now, if only finding a girlfriend was just that easy.

# A Brainstorming Session

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 141: A Brainstorming Session.

This is  English as a Second Language Podcast numbe r 141. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is about people who are trying to c ome up with new ideas at a brainstorming session. Let’s get started! > Judy: I've called this meeting so we can brainstorm  some fundraising ideas. As you know, we're in danger of closing. Any thoughts?
> Stan: I thought that Juan was working on getting do nors.
> Judy: He is, but we can't count on that coming thro ugh.
> Dominique: How much do we need to raise? What's a b allpark figure?
> Judy: We need at least $50,000 for next year.
> Dominique: That's a lot of money, but I think we'll  come up with something. How about a benefit performance?
> Stan: That sounds promising. Who can we get to perf orm?
> Judy: It would be great to get someone like Barry M anilow.
> Dominique: I think we're shooting too high. I was t hinking more like a local band or comedy group.
> Stan: I've got it. My brother works for The Improv.  He knows a lot of comedians from this area. Maybe we can get a few of them to p erform.
> Dominique: That would be great.
> The title of this podcast is “A Brainstorming Sessi on.” “To brainstorm” (brainstorm) – as a verb – means that you and someo ne else, perhaps a group of people, get together and you try to think of ideas to solve a problem – that is to brainstorm. And a “session” is simply the same here  as a meeting. Well, there are three people in today’s podcast having a brains torming session. Judy begins by saying, “I’ve called this meeting so we can brai nstorm some fundraising ideas.” The verb “to call” means, of course, you ca n call someone on your telephone, but we also use the verb “to call” with the idea of a meeting. “I’m going to call this meeting,” means I’m going to organize this meeting. Well, the meeting is to “brainstorm some fundraising ideas.” Once aga in, that verb “to fundraise” (fundraise) – all one word – “to fundraise” means t o try to make money, usually for an organization. A volunteer organization, for example, would try to do fundraising. And the noun for that is “fundraiser.”  Someone might say, “We’re having a fundraiser for my church.” So, you are try ing to make money. The verb would be “to raise money” for your organization.

Judy says that their organization is “in danger of closing.” “In danger of,” means that it hasn’t happened yet, but it could happen an d it’s always a negative thing that could happen. So, for example, you tell your b oss that he is an idiot, that he’s stupid. Well, you are now in danger of losing your job. So, that’s the meaning of “in danger of.” It’s when something bad may happen. There’s a possibility, it could happen.

Well, in this dialog, their organization is in dang er of closing. And notice also that we use the “ing” form of the verb. So, not “in dang er of close,” but “in danger of closing,” or shutting down. Stan recommends that – or comments rather – that he thought Juan was working on getting donors. A “dono r” (donor) is, as you probably know, someone who gives money. The verb is  “to donate” (donate). And Judy says that yes, he is. Juan is working on g etting donors. I should probably explain “He is working on” and the “ing” f orm, “getting.” “I am working on finishing my paper” – that means I am trying to, I am in the act of finishing my paper. Well, Judy says that they can’t “count on th at coming through.” “To count on” (count) – two words – means to depend upon, to rely upon, to think that it is going to happen. People sometimes say, “Don’t count  on it,” meaning don’t rely on that, it may not happen.

“To come through” here as a verb – “to come through ” (through) – means that – we use that expression, that verb “to come through, ” talking about someone who is going to help you, usually, out of a difficult s ituation and they haven’t yet helped you, but you hope that they will do what the y promised to do. And so, we’d say, “Well, I hope he comes through with that money,” meaning he says he was going to find the money so let’s hope he, in fa ct, does. And it’s usually used when you’re trying to help someone out of a difficu lt situation. Dominique says, “What’s a ballpark figure?” for how much money they  need. “What’s a ballpark figure?” “Ballpark” (ballpark) – all one word – a “ ballpark” is a place where you play baseball, for example, or football – it’s a bi g stadium. But the expression “Ballpark figure” – and “figure” (figure) – just me ans here, number. We use that expression “A ballpark figure” to mean an estimate,  an approximate number. Someone says, “Well, I’m not really exactly sure ho w much,” and you say, “Well, give me a ballpark figure” – that means an estimate , a guess. It may not necessarily be true, but it’s a guess, a good guess  – that’s a ballpark figure.

Judy says they need $50,000. Dominique says, “That’ s a lot of money,” and she suggests a “benefit performance.” A “benefit (benef it) performance” – a “performance” is usually a show or, for example, yo u could have a symphony orchestra or a band or a play – all of these could be performances. It’s when they actually sing or dance or whatever it is. Well, a b enefit performance is a special performance where people pay money to see the enter tainment – the performance. And that money goes to the organizatio n to help the organization. Stan says, “This sounds promising.” That expression  “It sounds promising” means it sounds like it’s a good idea. It sounds li ke something that will actually work. You can also say, “It looks promising.” For e xample, “I went on an interview for a new job because I told my boss he was stupid and fired me.” And the person – my friend says, “Well, how does it look?” And I say, “Well, it looks promising,” meaning I think I may get the job if I can keep my mouth shut.

Dominique says, “We’re shooting too high,” because Judy recommends getting Barry Manilow as a singer. Barry Manilow is an Amer ican singer from the 1970’s and 80’s. I guess he is still alive and Barry Manil ow is – he must be in his 90’s, I think. Anyway, he is a famous American pop singer. And Dominique says, “I think we’re shooting too high.” “To shoot (shoot) too hig h” means, or we also say “to aim (aim) too high” – means that you are trying to do more than is possible – trying to get a big famous singer – that’s not goin g to be possible. It’s shooting too high. It’s too difficult. Stan recommends that they try another solution. He says, “I’ve got it,” meaning I have an idea. I have  the solution. His brother works for “The Improv.” An “Improv” (improv) is short for  “improvisation” and it’s a place where you have comedians, where people get up and t ell jokes. And there’s actually a place here in Los Angeles called “The Im prov” and it’s a place where

you can go see famous comedians. Well, Stan says he  knows a lot of comedians and a “comedian” (comedian) is someone who tells jo kes – better than me.

Judy says, “I like how this is shaping up.” “To sha pe up” (shape) up (up) – two words – “to shape up” means you like how things are  developing. You like how things are turning out – are progressing – are comi ng along – all of those are the same. “To shape up” – “things are shaping up.” Now,  there’s another use of that verb “to shape up” and it’s sometimes used to mean to improve yourself. If your mother says, “You need to shape up” means you need to behave better. You need to act better. You need to improve yourself.

Judy says that they’re “out of time,” meaning they have no more time for their meeting but they agreed to meet on Friday to “hamme r out the details.” “To hammer (hammer) out (out)” – two words. Well, a “ha mmer” is what you use to put a nail – a little piece of metal in wood, for e xample. You hammer it. It’s long and it has a little – usually made of some sort of metal and it’s hard and it’s made for hitting. Well, “to hammer out,” however, means to figure out, to go over all of the smaller details. You can use this verb, for exa mple, when you’re talking about an agreement or a negotiation. “We’re going to hamm er out the details” means we’re going to figure them out. We have the big gen eral idea, now we’re going to talk about the – each individual item and all of it s details.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of story]

Judy: I've called this meeting so we can brainstorm  some fundraising ideas. As you know, we're in danger of closing. Any thoughts?

Stan: I thought that Juan was working on getting do nors.

Judy: He is, but we can't count on that coming thro ugh.

Dominique: How much do we need to raise? What's a b allpark figure?

Judy: We need at least $50,000 for next year.

Dominique: That's a lot of money, but I think we'll  come up with something. How about a benefit performance?

Stan: That sounds promising. Who can we get to perf orm?

Judy: It would be great to get somebody  like Barry  Manilow.

Dominique: I think we're shooting too high. I was t hinking more like a local band or comedy group.

Stan: I've got it. My brother works for The Improv.  He knows a lot of comedians from this area. Maybe we can get a few of them to p erform.

Dominique: That would be great.

Judy: I like how this is shaping up. We're out of t ime, but let's meet again on Friday to hammer out the details. Thanks everybody.

# At a Nightclub

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 142: At a Nightclub.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast number 142. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to go dancing! Here we  go!

[start of dialog]

My friend Sabrina and I decided to go out dancing l ast weekend. We went to a club called the Fine Line and when we got there, th ere was a long line outside. That's one thing I hate about L.A. clubs. The hotte st ones have long lines and it's hard to get in unless you're on the VIP list. Somet imes, the bouncer will pick cute girls out of line and let them in.

Sabrina always gets attention when we go out togeth er and the bouncer noticed her right away. We paid the cover charge and got ou r wristbands.

The first thing we did was to head over to the bar.

Andrea: The music is pretty good. Hey, is that Jeff  on the dance floor over there? He's so hot.

Sabrina: Where? Over there by the stage? Let's go s ee.

Jeff: Hey, did you guys just get here?

Sabrina: Yeah. Who are you here with?

Jeff: The DJ is a friend of mine. I came with him a nd some of his friends. We have a private room in back. Do you guys want to co me check it out?

Andrea: Sure.

Sabrina: Definitely.

[end of dialog]

Well, we went dancing in this podcast. I’m already feeling a little tired. The podcast begins with Andrea saying that she and her friend Sabrina went dancing last weekend. They went to a club called the Fine L ine. A “club” (club) usually is a place where people go dancing, sometimes even cal led a “dance club.” The word “club,” of course, is also used for a group or  organization especially at a school. So, you could have a theater club or a musi c club – people who get together to sing. But a “club,” when it comes to ta lking about a place is usually a place people go dancing.

Well, this club had a long line outside because man y people wanted to get in and Andrea says that the problem with clubs here in Los  Angeles is that the hottest ones have long lines. “To be hot” here means to be popular, to be the ones where most people want to go that are most interest ing. Well, it’s hard to get in – that is, it’s hard to enter into these clubs unless  you are on the “VIP list.” “VIP” stands for – means – “Very Important Person.” And a  “VIP list” would be people who are celebrities or are famous or maybe they are  rich and they know the owner of the club. These are the kind of people tha t get on the “VIP list.” We can use that term, by the way, “VIP list,” or just “VIP .” “He’s a VIP” means he’s a very important person in the organization or whatever yo u’re talking about. The host of ESL Podcast is definitely not a VIP.

At the club where Sabrina and Andrea are, the perso n outside of the door to the club is called a “bouncer.” A “bouncer” (bouncer) i s the person who is in charge of – usually, there are more than one – in charge of letting people in, deciding who gets into the club. And also, they’re in charge  of security if someone is being too loud or drinks too much. The bouncer will take care of that. Usually, at least in American clubs, they’re very big, muscular, stro ng men who you don’t want to get in a fight with, let’s just say. So, a bouncer is usually, sort of a very big, mean person – that’s the reputation of a bouncer. Well, the bouncer, who’s normally a man, likes to pick the cute or pretty girls out of line and let them in. When we say, “They will pick them out of line,” meaning they’ll be standing in the line and they’ll say, “You, you and you, can come in.” They will let  them in or let them enter.

Well, Sabrina is apparently very attractive and goo d looking, so she gets picked out by the bouncer, and Sabrina and Andrea are able  to go into the club. Well, in most American dance clubs, or where there’s dancing  or sometimes where there’s just music being played, there’s what we ca ll a “cover charge” – two words “cover (cover) charge (charge).” A cover char ge is like a ticket. It’s like admission. It’s how much you have to pay just to ge t into the club. I think the price of the cover charge is probably ten, fifteen,  twenty dollars per person for most of the clubs here in L.A. I have not been to a  dance club in many years. I

think 1976 – something like that – but the dance cl ubs here in Los Angeles are expensive, for the cover charge.

Well, one thing that is true of American – in all of the states in the United States, is that the drinking age – the age that you can dri nk alcohol legally – is 21. But there are many clubs that will let people under 21 – usually 18 and over – they can go to the club but they can’t drink. Well, they  can’t drink beer or wine or any sort of alcohol. So, if you are of age – that is if  you are over 21 years old, and you have to show identification, then you get a certain  color “wristband.” And a “wristband” – all one word – (wristband) – your wri st is that part of your arm next to your hand. It’s the end of your arm but before y our hand and that is a little plastic –bracelet – is what it is. It goes around y our arm and your wrist and that is proof that you are old enough to drink or that you are not old enough to drink. So, if you go to the bar, you have to have the right wr istband on.

Well, the first thing that Andrea and Sabrina did w as to head over or to go to the bar. The word “bar” has a couple of meanings. A “ba r” can be a place where people drink, have alcohol to drink. But inside of a restaurant or a club, a “bar” is the actual place where you can order your drink and  usually, the person behind the bar who’s called the “bartender” – all one word  – (bartender). The bartender is the one who gives you your drinks. So, you can g o and sit by the bar – in a bar. So a bar is a place like a restaurant or a clu b, but it’s also a part of a restaurant, club, or bar. It’s a place where you go  to get your drinks.

Andrea says the music is pretty good here and she s ays, “Hey. Is that Jeff on the dance floor? Over there?” The “dance floor” is, of course, the place where people dance. We call that the “dance floor.” It’s usually  one part of the club and Andrea says about Jeff – not me. I’m not the Jeff – a diff erent Jeff – says, “He’s so hot.” And when you say a man or a woman is “hot” (hot) it  means they’re very attractive, they’re very good looking, they’re very  handsome or very pretty. I am not any of those things, so it’s not me in the stor y here.

Sabrina says, “Where is Jeff?” or “Where? Over by t he stage?” And the “stage” (stage) is where the band, if there is a band, woul d be playing on top of a stage – usually at the front of the club. Well, Sabrina goe s over and Andrea go over to talk to Jeff, and Jeff says that “The DJ is a frien d of mine.” The “DJ” – Capital DJ – means the “Disc Jockey.” The “disc (disc) jockey (jockey) – and the “DJ” or disc jockey is the person who plays the music when there  isn’t a live band. They just have CD’s and the person who is playing the CD’s, s electing the CD’s is the DJ. Well, Jeff says that he is a friend of the DJ and t hat they have “a private room in back.” In many clubs, again especially here in Los Angeles, there is usually a separate room for the VIP’s – for people who are im portant and they get their

own little room and that’s what the private room is . Jeff asked the women if they want to “check it out,” meaning do you want to go a nd take a look and they say, “Sure,” and “Definitely,” meaning absolutely yes – they’re very interested.

Well, now let’s listen to the story this time at a native rate of speech.

# Fighting a Parking Ticket

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 143: Fighting a Parking Ticket.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 143. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This podcast is about trying to get out of or fight  a parking ticket. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Mindy: Hey, where are you going?

Eric: I'm going to traffic court. I got a parking t icket and I'm going to fight it.

Mindy: How much was the fine?

Eric: It was only $40. But it's not the money. It's  the principle of the thing.

Mindy: Why? Weren't you parked illegally?

Eric: No, I wasn’t. The street I live on has metere d parking from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. After 6, you can park there with a permit. Well , I parked my car at 7:30 PM and I have a permit. But, I still got a ticket.

Mindy: Did you display the permit clearly? It isn't  expired, is it?

Eric: Yeah, it's clearly displayed and it's good un til June 2007.

Mindy: Well, it sounds like you have a good case. A re you representing yourself or did you hire a lawyer?

Eric: I'm going there by myself. Wish me luck.

Mindy: Good luck. If the judge locks you away, I pr omise to visit you in jail.

Eric: Thanks a lot. I'll remember that.

[end of dialogue]

The title of this podcast is “Fighting a Parking Ti cket.” A “parking ticket,” of course, is what you get when you are parked illegal ly – your car is parked illegally. And to “fight (fight) a ticket” means to  protest and try to avoid paying the parking ticket, the fine that comes with the ticket . And that usually means talking to a judge. And the dialog begins with Eric saying that he is going to traffic court. The “court (court) system” is another name for our legal system where you have judges and there are different kinds of courts. The re are criminal courts and that’s for people who have robbed someone or murder ed – those crimes go to criminal court and then there is civil court. And “ civil (civil) courts” are for things like lawsuits – when you hit someone’s car and they  “sue” you (sue) – they “sue” you – meaning they demand money from you. Well, tra ffic court is a little different. Traffic court is just for dealing with p roblems, crimes, and fines that are related to the driving of a car and parking is part  of that. So, if you have a parking ticket and you want to fight it, you would have to go to traffic court – the court that handles or the court that deals with that issue.

Well, Eric says he got a parking ticket, which we k now is a fine that you get for doing something wrong. He says, “He’s going to figh t it.” Mindy asks, “How much was the fine?” And the “fine” is the money that you  pay to the government. Usually it’s the city government but it could be wh atever local government is there. Well, the fine is the amount he pays and Eri c says the fine is “only $40,” meaning he doesn’t think it’s very expensive. It’s “only $40.” He says, “But it’s not the money. It’s the principle of the thing.” “It’s the principle” (principle) of the thing – meaning it’s not the money but it’s the idea that  he was right and not wrong and so, he wants to show that he was right. A “principl e” is an idea – usually something that you believe in – a “principle.” Ther e are two words in English that sound the same – “principle.” It can also be spelle d (principal), and that sort of “principal” means the primary or first. So, if you said, “The principal reason why I am going is because I need money.” Well, that would  be the first or most important reason – that’s “pal” and when it is spel led (ple) it’s an idea or a value or something that – some idea that you believe in. In school, the “principal” is the director or head master or leader of the school. In  most American schools, this is called – this person is called the “principal” and that’s spelled (pal).

Mindy asked why he wants – Eric wants – to fight the parking ticket. She says, “Weren’t you parked illegally?” “Illegally,” of cou rse, (illegally) – “illegally” is not legally. And Eric says, “No.” The street he lives o n has “metered parking.” “Metered parking’ (metered) is a street that has, y ou can guess, parking meters, and parking meters are those little machines that y ou put money into. Here in Los Angeles, it costs maybe – depends on where you are,  but most parking meters

are 50 cents or a quarter for 1 hour of parking. Bu t if you are in a very busy area, it could be a dollar or $1.50 for one hour of parki ng. In many American cities, parking is a big way that the local government make s money.

So, there are special police officers that are – th ey’re not police officers – they’re special employees of the police department that giv e parking tickets. And these are sometimes – well they used to be called “Meter Maids.” “Meter Maids” (maids) – because they were mostly women – a maid i s another word for a woman. And a “Meter Maid” was someone – were women who went around and checked the meters – took the money out of the mete rs and so forth. But now, the name that we give them – the people are part of  what is called “Parking Enforcement.” “Parking Enforcement” – “to enforce ( enforce) a law” – usually we use that expression with the law – “to enforce a la w” – means that the government or the police will punish you if you don ’t follow the law. There are many laws. Not all of them are enforced, meaning the police don’t arrest people for everything they could.

Los Angeles, like many cities has many parking mete rs and that’s how it makes part of its money. Well, Los Angeles in particular has a very difficult – in some areas – rules and regulations for parking and they change. Different days, you can park on certain streets at different times and it can be very confusing to someone. There are sometimes three or four differen t signs that you have to read to figure out whether it’s okay to park there on that day at that time. Well, going back to the story.

Eric says that he lives on a street that have meter ed parking from 9AM in the morning to 6 PM in the afternoon. After 6 he says, “You can park on the street with a permit.” And a “permit” (permit) is somethin g that gives you permission to park somewhere. Some streets are so busy that only if you live on that street can you park there at certain times. That’s true in man y streets here in Los Angeles. Of course, everyone has a car in Los Angeles so tha t’s another reason why they want to limit the parking to people who live in tha t area. And so, they give you a permit which you put in the window of your car so t hat the police or the traffic or parking enforcement, rather, knows that you have pe rmission. Eric says he parked his car with his permit but he “still got a ticket,” meaning he got a ticket nevertheless. Even though he had a permit, he still  got a ticket.

Mindy says, “Did you display the permit clearly?” m eaning did you put it so that they could see it. “To display” (display) means to show someone, to make sure that it can be seen. She asked if the permit was ex pired and when we say something has “expired” (expired) that means it is no longer any good. You can no longer use it. Eric says, “It was clearly displa yed,” and that the permit “is good

until June 2007.” When something “is good until” a certain date or time, we mean that it is still okay. It is still – you can still use it until that time.

Mindy says that Eric has a “good case.” A “good cas e” (case) means that he has a good argument, a good chance of winning. She aske d if he is representing himself or is he hiring a lawyer. “To represent you rself” means that you go to the court, in front of the judge by yourself and you te ll the judge directly and you are your own lawyer, you could say. But most people wou ld hire a lawyer. And a “lawyer” is, of course, (lawyer) the person who arg ues your case, argues in front of the judge – tells them why you should be let fre e or in this case, why you should not have to pay the ticket. Eric then tells Mindy, “Wish me luck,” meaning wish that I – tell me that I have good luck or hope  that I have good luck – wish me luck. Mindy says, “Good luck. And if the judge l ocks you away, I promise to visit you in jail.” “To lock (lock) someone away” m eans to put them in prison, to put them in jail. Mindy, of course, is making a lit tle joke.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Mindy: Hey, where are you going?

Eric: I'm going to traffic court. I got a parking t icket and I'm going to fight it.

Mindy: How much was the fine?

Eric: It was only $40. But it's not the money. It's  the principle of the thing.

Mindy: Why? Weren't you parked illegally?

Eric: No, I wasn’t. The street I live on has metere d parking from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. After 6, you can park there with a permit. Well , I parked my car at 7:30 PM and I have a permit. But, I still got a ticket.

Mindy: Did you display the permit clearly? It isn't  expired, is it?

Eric: Yeah, it's clearly displayed and it's good un til June 2007.

Mindy: Well, it sounds like you have a good case. A re you representing yourself or did you hire a lawyer?

Eric: I'm going there by myself. Wish me luck.

 Mindy: Good luck. If the judge locks you away, I pr omise to visit you in jail.

Eric: Thanks a lot. I'll remember that.

# Who Pays?

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 144: Who Pays?

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 144. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This podcast is about who should pay for a dinner, with a man and a woman. Let’s go!

[start of dialog]

David: Hey, Sally. Can I run something by you?

Sally: Sure, what's up?

David: Well, a friend of a friend wanted some help with her taxes and we agreed that we would talk about it over dinner. At the end  of the night, when the check came, she expected me to pay! It was really awkward . It wasn't a date and I was doing her a favor! Am I crazy or was she taking adv antage of me?

Sally: It definitely sounds like she took advantage  of your generosity. If she was asking a favor, she should have paid. No question.

David: The thing is, I thought she was really prett y and I wanted to ask her out after I met her. But, now I'm not sure.

Sally: Well, I think that unless you asked her out,  you shouldn't have to pay for her. And, these days, a lot of people go Dutch even  if one person asks  the other. Based on what happened the other night, I'd stay aw ay from this woman. That is, unless you don't mind being her sugar daddy.

David: Yeah, right. I'm too broke to be anybody's s ugar daddy, even if I wanted to. I think you're right. That will be the last I s ee of her.

Script by Dr. Lucy Tse

[end of dialog]

In this podcast, we have a man asking a woman’s adv ice about the issue of who should pay when a man and a woman go out to dinner.  The dialog begins with David saying, “Can I run something by you?” “To run  something by someone” means, usually, to tell them and to ask for their o pinion. So, you’re giving someone an idea or giving them some information and  asking them to give you their opinion about it. So, David says, “Hey, Sally . Can I run something by you?” And Sally says, “Sure. What’s up?” meaning what is it that you want to talk about. David says that a “friend of a friend” – not his fr iend, but a friend of his friends – had wanted some help with her taxes. Here, when som eone says, “I will help you with your taxes (taxes)” that means they will help you prepare the paperwork or the forms that you have to send in to the governmen t. “Taxes,” of course, is money you pay the government. In the United States,  we have “income tax” – a federal national income tax and you have to send in  information every year, by April 15th of how much money you made last year. Ho w much taxes you paid already and then you have to send any additional ta x that you owe the government.

Well, David is going to help this woman prepare her  taxes and they decided to talk about it “over dinner.” When we say, “over din ner,” or “over lunch,” or “over some meal,” we mean while we are eating dinner or r ight after we eat dinner. So, if someone says, “Let’s talk about it over lunch” t hey mean let’s go to lunch and there we can talk about it.

Well, at the end of the night, David says, when the  bill or the check came, she, the woman, expected David to pay. David said, “It w as really awkward.” “To be awkward” (awkward) means that it was strange, it wa s odd. “Awkward” is when neither person feels very comfortable, and no one k nows quite what to do. So, for example, if you were talking to a woman that you are romantically interested in and her husband came up and started talking to her,  that might be a little awkward for you – sometimes the same as embarrassin g but not always. It just means uncomfortable situation.

David says that the dinner that he was having wasn’ t a date. A “date,” of course, (date) is when a man and a woman go out, or you go out with someone you are romantically interested in – have dinner, a movie a nd so forth. Well, David says that he was doing her a favor. And “to do someone a  favor” means that you are helping them. You are doing something nice for them . David says, “Am I crazy? Or was she taking advantage of me?” That expression  “Am I crazy?” means am I wrong? Isn’t this obvious that I am right and the o ther person is wrong? “Am I crazy or was she taking advantage of me?” “To take advantage of someone” means that, for example, I ask you to come over to my house to help me fix something in my house – fix my computer – and when you’re there, you say,

“Yes,” and then I say, “Oh, and can you fix my brot her’s computer, my sister’s computer and my uncle’s computer?” Well, you are ta king advantage of that person, meaning you’re asking them to do something much more than what they said. They were being nice to you and then you trea t them in a not very nice or not very considerate way. So, to take advantage of someone is a negative thing.

Well, Sally says that it definitely sounds like the  woman took advantage of his generosity. “Generosity” means, of course, to be ge nerous – means to give other people your time or your money or things – that is to be generous, to be nice. Sally says that she, the woman at the dinner, shoul d have paid. No question. We say, “No question” – we mean there is no doubt. Thi s is absolutely certain that this is correct – no question. David then says, “Th e thing is, I thought she was really pretty.” That is a very common expression. “ The thing is” – to tell someone that you are about to tell them something important  or something interesting. It’s another way of saying, “What I am about to say is v ery important.”

Well, David says that he thought the woman was very  pretty and he wanted to ask her out after he met her. “To ask someone out” means, you probably know, to ask them to go with you on a romantic date. Sall y then says that unless David asked the woman out, he should not have had to pay for her. She then goes on to say that a lot of people “go Dutch.” “To go Dutc h” – capital (Dutch) – means that everyone pays for themselves. So, when two peo ple go out to dinner and they decide to go “Dutch,” that means each person w ill pay for their own meal. “Dutch” is an adjective – means from the Netherland s, the country in Europe, and probably not a very nice thing to say about people from the Netherlands, but it’s an expression we use in English. “To go Dutch” mean s that everyone pays for themselves. “To invite someone” would mean that you  paid – you would pay for them. But to go Dutch, you pay for yourself.

Well, she says – Sally says to David that he should  stay away from this woman, meaning he should not be with or try to go out with  this woman. That is, she says, unless you don’t mind being her “sugar daddy. ” “Unless you don’t mind,” meaning if it doesn’t bother you – “being her sugar  daddy.” It’s kind of a funny expression “sugar (sugar) daddy (daddy)” – like a f ather. “To be a sugar daddy” means that you are a man who pays for everything th at a woman wants, and again, it’s sort of the idea that she is taking adv antage of you if you are romantically interested in each other. “To be a sug ar daddy” would be to pay for all of her bills, all of her food, and so forth. It ’s a negative term, however.

Sally here uses it as a joke and David says, in res ponse, he says, “Yeah, right.” That expression “Yeah, right” means I disagree, tha t’s not true. You would think it would mean I agree, but it actually means the oppos ite when you say it with that

particular intonation that particular tone. “Yeah, right” means I don’t believe you – that’s not something that I agree with. David says that he’s “too broke to be anybody’s sugar daddy.” “To be broke” (broke) means  not to have any money. I’m broke. I don’t have any money – that’s true – n ot just in the story. Well, David then says that the dinner he had with this woman, “ will be the last I see of her.” “The last (last)” means I won’t be seeing her again .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a native rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

David: Hey, Sally. Can I run something by you?

Sally: Sure, what's up?

David: Well, a friend of a friend wanted some help with her taxes and we agreed that we would talk about it over dinner. At the end  of the night, when the check came, she expected me to pay! It was really awkward . It wasn't a date and I was doing her a favor! Am I crazy or was she taking adv antage of me?

Sally: It definitely sounds like she took advantage  of your generosity. If she was asking a favor, she should have paid. No question.

David: The thing is, I thought she was really prett y and I wanted to ask her out after I met her. But, now I'm not sure.

# The Big Game

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  145: The Big Game.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 145. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going back to school and to the big game. Let’s go!

[start of dialog]

On my way home from class, I ran into Cara, a schoo lmate that I have not seen in a few months. I stopped to say hi to her.

Mark: Hey, Cara! How's everything? Long time no see .

Cara: Yeah! It's been a while. I'm doing alright. H ow  about you?

Mark: Great! I'm excited about the Big Game this we ekend. Are you going?

Cara: Uh, no. What Big Game?

Mark: Are you kidding? This is the biggest football  game of the season! And we're playing against one of the best teams in the state, so it's going to be really exciting.

Cara: Wow, that sounds like fun! Who are you going with?

Mark: A big group of friends. Hey, you know what? O ne of my friends has to go out of town this weekend and he won't be able to ma ke it to the game, so I have an extra ticket. You want to join us?

Cara: Sure, I would love to go! I've never been to one of our school's football games before.

Mark: Awesome! There's a bus picking students up in  front of the dorms at 1pm. Meet us there at 12:30.

Cara: Sounds like a plan! Thanks for giving me the extra ticket. I'll see you Saturday.

 Mark: Alright, see ya!

[end of dialog]

In this podcast, we heard a conversation between tw o students talking about going to the “Big Game.” And the “Big Game” is usua lly the most important football game at a high school or a university. It’ s usually a game between the team and its most important rival. And a “rival” (r ival) is someone you are competing against. The dialog begins with Mark sayi ng, “On my way home from class, I ran into Cara.” “On my way home” means as I was going home. He was coming, in this case, home from class, from his uni versity or high school class, and he ran into Cara. “To run into someone” means t hat you meet someone that you weren’t expecting. Cara is a schoolmate. And a “schoolmate” (schoolmate) – all one word – is someone that you go to school wit h – someone in your same school is a schoolmate. Mark says to Cara, “How’s e verything? Long time no see.” “How’s everything?” “How are you?” “How are t hings going?” – all of those are ways of asking about how someone is doing. “Lon g time, no see” is an expression we use when we haven’t seen someone in a  long time. So, literally it’s been a long time since I have seen you.

Cara says that she’s “doing alright” – means she’s okay. Mark says he’s excited about the “Big Game this weekend.” And we talked ab out the big game is usually the most important football game – American footbal l game that is. And Cara doesn’t know about the big game. Mark says, “Are yo u kidding?” meaning are you joking? And that’s an expression we use when we ’re surprised by what someone says or what someone does – “Are you kiddin g?” – means how can you not know? It’s so important or famous, in this case. Well, Mark explains that this is the biggest football game of the season and  the “season” (season) is the period of time, in this case, when you are playing a sport. So, the football season is usually in the fall. And the baseball season is in the summer. So, we use that term – not just to describe the four seasons – Spri ng, Summer, Fall and Winter – but also the seasons of a particular event, when the dates or the months of a particular event.

Well, this is the biggest football game of the seas on and Cara asks who Mark is going with. Mark says he’s going with a big group of friends and then he says, “Hey. You know what?” And that expression – “You kn ow what?” – is something you would say before you are going to tell someone or ask someone a question – often involving some sort of favor or good news tha t you are giving this person. So, for example, in this case, Mark says, “You know  what?” One of his friends is not going to be able to go to the game and he has a n extra ticket. So that’s good

news for that person. That expression “You know wha t?” is used often in front of – when we are about to tell someone some unexpected  good news – usually something we are giving to them or some favor we are doing for them. You can also use this expression simply to call attention t o or to indicate to the other person that what you are going to say is important.  And that can be a positive or a negative thing. So, if maybe you’re arguing with someone and you say, “You know what? I’m leaving. I don’t want to talk to you . So, it can be used both in a positive and a negative way.

Well, the favor here is that Mark is going to give Cara a ticket to the big game. The reason his friend cannot make the game – and “t o make the game” would mean to go to the game. He’s not able to make it – that is the game – because he has to go out of town. And to go “out of town” m eans that they have to – the person has to travel somewhere else, to another cit y or another state. That’s a very common expression “I’m going to be out of town . I’m not going to be here in Los Angeles. I’m going to be in Las Vegas losing al l of my money – that is to go out of town. It can be for business or it can be for a vacation. Cara says that she would love to go – I would love to do that. I would  really like to do that. And she says she’s never been to one of the football games before. Mark responds by saying, “Awesome.” “Awesome” (awesome) is the same as that’s great – that’s wonderful news. When you hear something very good a nd you’re very excited, you would say, “Awesome.”

Mark says that there’s a bus picking up students to  go to the game, in front of the dorms at 1 PM. The “dorms” (dorms) is short for dor mitories and a dormitory is a place on a school – usually a university – a colleg e where students live. And dorms are owned by the school. So, most big schools  have dorms where students from other parts of the state or the count ry can live. If they don’t live there in the city. Of course, many students in Amer ican universities also live in apartment buildings and they rent apartments, often  sharing the apartment with one or two or more students. And that is also one w ay to attend a university that is in a different city, or many times, even if you live in the same city as the university – your parents do - students will someti mes get their own apartment when they begin their first year of college. And the difference between a dorm and an apartment, usually – well, first, the dorm i s owned by the university. The apartment building would be owned by someone – some  company or some private individual. The other difference is that do rms are usually smaller and they usually don’t have a kitchen. So, you can’t cook fo od in most dorms. Some dorms, you can. Some dorms are more like apartments , but most dorms have no kitchen and so, you have to eat – the school has a big cafeteria – a place where lots of people can eat and they prepare food. So, y ou have to pay for the dorm room but you also have to pay for your food.

 Well, in this case, they are going to pick up stude nts – back to the dialog here – they are going to pick up students in front of the dorms, and Mark says to Cara that she should meet him there at 12:30. Cara says,  “Sounds like a plan.” “Sounds like a plan” means that’s a good idea. And this is an expression we use when – kind of informal expression I guess – when y ou are agreeing with someone, you have decided on a plan – what you are going to do and it’s a way of saying you agree with this plan. “Sounds like a plan” means that’s a good idea, in this case. Mark then says, “Alright. See ya!” “S ee ya!” (ya) means, of course, the same as see you – means I will see you there at  12:30.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

On my way home from class, I ran into Cara, a schoo lmate that I have not seen in a few months. I stopped to say hi to her.

Mark: Hey, Cara! How's everything? Long time no see .

# Suggestions at Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 146 – Suggestions at Work.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 146. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this podcast, we’re going to talk about giving o ur ideas or suggestions in a business environment. Let's get started.

[start of dialog]

Our company has been growing very quickly and I was  put in charge of reorganizing our office space to accommodate severa l new employees. I asked my co-worker, Petra, for her advice.

Fernando: I was thinking of dividing up two of the larger offices into four smaller offices. What do you think about that?

Petra: Well, it seems to me that doing that would o nly solve part of the problem. Have you considered converting the conference room into offices?

Fernando: I'm not sure that will work. We don't hav e another meeting space if we do that. What are your thoughts on turning the coff ee room into one large office with cubicles?

Petra: In my opinion, that's not going to be a very  popular solution.

Fernando: The way I see it, there are no easy solut ions and that may be the best one. Do you have any other suggestions?

Petra: No, none that would really work. In my opini on, the only solution is to divide up the executive offices. But, I know, I kno w. That's not going to happen. My suggestion is to ask a few more of the old emplo yees. Maybe they'll think of something.

Fernando: I think you're right. It's not going to b e an easy decision and I can use all the help I can get.

[end of dialog]

 Our story begins with Fernando saying that our “com pany has been growing very quickly and I was put in charge of reorganizing our  office space to accommodate several new employees.” So the company has been gro wing. It’s been getting bigger. They have been hiring or bringing in new em ployees and Fernando was put in charge of reorganizing the office space. “To  be put in charge of something” means to be made the person responsible for a certa in task or activity. If you are put in charge of a celebration, or of a meeting, or  of any sort of activity, you are the boss. You are the person who needs to be respon sible. You are the person who is supposed to get it done.

Fernando is supposed to reorganize the office space . “To reorganize” means to organize again. That prefix “re” means to do again.  In this case, it means probably to move some desks from one location to an other, to somehow change the way the office is set up, that is, the way the office looks so that more people can work in that same space. We use the term “offic e space” to refer to the area where the offices are for a business.

Fernando is supposed to accommodate several new emp loyees. “To accommodate” (accommodate) means, in this case, to make room for, to make space for. I have to accommodate some new people in  my company. I have to find a place for them. I have to arrange things so that they are able to come and work here.

“Employees” are, of course, workers, people who wor k for a company. Fernando asks his coworker, another person who works at the company, by the name of Petra, to get her advice. Fernando says, “I was thi nking of dividing up two of the larger offices into four smaller offices.” Fernando  wants to divide up the office. “To divide up” means to take something and make it into smaller pieces. It really means the same here as “to divide.” “I’m going to d ivide this into four pieces.” You could say that. Or you could say “I'm going to divide this up into four pieces.” “Up” is just used for emphasis.

Fernando wants to take two large offices and divide  them up, or split them in half so that you have four smaller offices. Each office would be divided into two, in other words. He asked Petra what she thinks about t hat idea. Petra says, “Well, it seems to me” – in my opinion – “doing that would on ly solve part of the problem.” “To solve a problem” is to find the answer to some question or some difficulty that you have. In this case, the problem is accommodatin g new employees.

Petra says, “Have you considered” – have you though t about – “converting the conference room into offices?” “To convert” means t o change something from

one use to another use. Petra is recommending conve rting, or changing, the conference room into offices. The conference room i s a large room in an office building where you have meetings of five, ten, mayb e 20 people, depending on how big the room is.

Fernando says, “I'm not sure that will work.” “Work ” here means – will be a successful solution to the problem. “The reason why ,” Fernando says, “is that we don't have another meeting space if we do that.” A “meeting space” is just a place where you would have a meeting. If they take the conference room and convert it into offices, then they won't have a pla ce for their meetings.

Fernando says, “What are your thoughts on turning t he coffee room into one large office with cubicles?” “What are your thought s on” is a way of asking someone for their opinion. That, of course, is what  this whole dialog is about – expressions that we use in giving and asking for su ggestions in a work environment. This is a very common expression – “What are your thoughts on?” “What are your thoughts on?” means what is your opi nion about something.

In this case, Fernando wants to know Petra’s opinio n, or her thoughts, on turning or converting the coffee room into one large office . The “coffee room,” which may also be called the “break room,” is a place where e mployees can go on their break or during their lunchtime. If it's a big room , they can sit down and eat their lunch there if they brought their lunch to work.

What Fernando is suggesting is that they convert the coffee room into one large office with “cubicles.” “Cubicles” (cubicles) are l ike small offices, but the walls are not as high as a normal wall. The wall of the cubic le doesn't go all the way up to the top of the room, to the ceiling. “Cubicles” are  usually made by taking a big room and using these small portable walls – walls t hat can be moved back and forth – in order to make a square space for someone  to sit and work in.

Petra says, “In my opinion, that's not going to be a very popular solution.” “In my opinion” – once again, she's giving her ideas – “th at's not going to be a very popular solution.” People aren't going to like that  solution. Fernando responds by using another expression that is common in giving y our opinion about something. He says, “The way I see it.” “The way I see it” mea ns here is my opinion. Here's the way I view this situation. Fernando says, “Ther e are no easy solutions.” There are no answers that are going to be easy, tha t aren’t going to cause some other problems.

“That may be the best one,” Fernando says, meaning his solution may be the best one. “Do you have any other suggestions?” This  is a question that you use

to ask someone for additional ideas. “Do you have a ny other suggestions (or recommendations)?”

Petra says, “No, none that would really work” – non e that would be successful. “In my opinion, the only solution is to divide up t he executive offices.” “In my opinion,” again, is a phrase we could use when we a re going to give our own ideas about a situation. “The only solution,” Petra  says, “is to divide up the executive offices.” “Executive offices” are offices  for the leaders of the company: the president, the vice president, and so forth.

Petra says, “But I know, I know. That's not going t o happen.” She says, “I know, I know,” meaning she understands that that solution w on't work. She says, “That's not going to happen. My suggestion is to ask a few more of the old employees.” Petra is telling Fernando to get the opinion of oth er employees who have been at the company for a long time.

“Maybe they'll think of something.” “To think of so mething” means to have an idea, a solution to a problem. Fernando says, “I th ink you're right. It's not going to be an easy decision and I can use all the help I ca n get.” That last expression, “I can use all the help I can get,” means I'm going to  need a lot of help. There can't be too much help. The more I get, the better my sit uation will be.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Our company has been growing very quickly and I was  put in charge of reorganizing our office space to accommodate severa l new employees. I asked my co-worker, Petra, for her advice.

Fernando: I was thinking of dividing up two of the larger offices into four smaller offices. What do you think about that?

Petra: Well, it seems to me that doing that would o nly solve part of the problem. Have you considered converting the conference room into offices?

In this podcast, we’re talking about reading and wa tching the news – what happens in the world. The story begins by saying, “ I’m a news junkie.” A “junkie” (junkie) is a word we normally use to describe a pe rson who is addicted to a drug like cocaine or heroin, something like that. But wh en we say a “news junkie,” we mean someone who is addicted to news, who likes to do something a lot. The story says that “I like to read two newspapers ever y day” – that’s actually true. I do like to read two newspapers every day. I don’t j ust look at the headlines. The “headlines” (headlines) – all one word – the headli nes are the titles of the stories. Usually, they’re in bigger print and you can read t hem easily.

 There are different types of news in a daily newspa per. There is “political news” – news about politics, government, that sort of thing . The “business news,” of course, is news about what’s happening in finance a nd business. The “editorials” (editorials) – an editorial is an opinion. And it’s  usually someone on the newspaper, who works for the newspaper, or someone else who writes an editorial. We sometimes call these, either, opinion s or editorials, or we’ll call them “Op-ed” (op-ed). “Op-ed” pieces are opinions or edi torials that are written for the editorial page.

In most American newspapers, there are actually two  pages of editorials every day. The newspaper writes editorials that it often doesn’t sign. But then there are individuals who have editorials and, of course, peo ple write letters to the newspaper. And there’s also “entertainment news” – news about celebrities, about Tom Cruise or Jennifer Anniston, and so forth  – that’s entertainment news. I say here that I don’t usually read the “sports pa ges” or “classifieds.” The “sports pages” are, of course, the section of the newspaper  that talks a lot about sports. The “classifieds” in a newspaper (classified) – her e it’s plural – the “classified” – “classifieds.” We sometimes call these the “classif ied ads.” These are advertisements for everything – jobs, cars – people  who are selling things will put in a “classified” in the newspaper – that is a clas sified advertisement. They’re called “classifieds” in part because they are arran ged in the newspaper according to a certain classification or category. So, all the ones about selling cars are in the same classification, the same section.

I say I also try to catch the “local” news. We use that verb “to catch” (catch) to mean here to watch. Someone may say to you, “Did yo u catch that movie on television last night?” And well, you say, “No, I d idn’t catch it,” or “Yes. I watched it.” You can also say, “I caught.” “I caught a good  show on last night.” It means to watch. The “local TV news” are, of course, the news  broadcast that talk about things from a particular city, in a particular city  – Los Angeles, of course, here. We have different channels – what we call “local ch annels” here in Los Angeles and every big city. Usually, there are two or three . Many times, however, there are five or six in a given city. Big cities like Lo s Angeles and New York have several local channels or local stations that you can watch. And, of course, the channels have a number. So, Channel 4, Channel 11, Channel 9, and so forth.

I say that I like to watch the “weather report.” the “weather report” (report) is the section of the local news where they tell you about  the weather. And the story says that “I like to watch Channel 9 because the we ather reporter” – and a “reporter” (reporter) is the person that gives a re port or gives you certain news. “The weather reporter is not only very good, but sh e’s beautiful.” That’s actually

true. There is a beautiful weather reporter on Chan nel 9 here in Los Angeles. I only watch her when my wife is not home. So, don’t tell her.

The “national” news – we talked about local news, b ut there are also national news programs. There are usually one of these every  day, at least. They’re 30 minutes long and there are three – the three bigges t television companies. We call them “networks” (networks). The three biggest networks each have their own program and the person who reads the news is called  “the anchor” (anchor) – the “anchor.” That word “anchor,” we also use for a boa t, when you want to stop your boat or keep your boat in one place on a lake or an  ocean, you drop or put an anchor. It’s a heavy weight. Well, in a news progra m – a television news program – the anchor is the most important person. It’s the  person that reads most of the news and there usually is one, sometimes two people  who are the anchors, they could be co-anchors. I say I like them all. So, it doesn’t matter which one I catch. Notice again, “catch,” meaning to watch a televisio n show.

I say, “On top of that, I like to read a newsmagazi ne each week.” That expression “On top (top)” – “On top of that” means in addition  to. We usually use that expression when someone has been telling you about many different things – a lot of things – and then they say, “On top of that, ” meaning even more than the many things they have told you. Well, on top of wat ching the news and reading the newspaper, I also read a “newsmagazine.” “Newsm agazine” is all one word – (newsmagazine) – and that is usually a weekly magaz ine that gives you the news – the national news for that entire previous week. The biggest newsmagazines are Time, and Newsweek, in English. But there are o ther newsmagazines also. Some of them are political, some of them are entert ainment, some of them are sports and so forth. But a newsmagazine, usually, i s a general newsmagazine like Time or Newsweek, when we say that, use that e xpression.

I say that “I like the longer feature stories that give more in-depth coverage.” A “feature” (feature) or a “feature story” is a longe r story that gives more information. And to say something “gives more infor mation,” means it gives “in- depth coverage. “In-depth (in-depth)” – “in-depth” means with a lot of detail – talking about something for a long time and giving very specific, detailed information. “Coverage” (coverage) is a noun we use  to describe when a news story is about a certain topic. We say that the sto ry “covers” a topic. And so the “coverage” as a noun, is what a reporter or a magaz ine or a newspaper says about a particular topic. So, to have “in-depth cov erage” would mean to have lots of details about a particular topic. I say I like t o read about the “top stories.” The “top (top) stories” are the most important stories.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech.

# Paying the Bills

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 148: Paying the Bills.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 148. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to pay our bills. Let’ s go!

[start of dialog]

Grace: Did you already pay the bills for this month ?

Will: No, I haven't gotten around to it yet. Why?

Grace: We got a late notice from the credit card co mpany. The notice says that they haven't received the payment yet and it's past  the due date. We are being charged a late fee plus a finance charge of 15%.

Will: Let me see that. That can't be right. I paid the minimum payment on the last bill. I better call and talk to customer service to morrow. I'm sure it's a mix-up.

Grace: I really hope so. The last time we were late  with the payment, I tried calling them and telling them that the check was in  the mail, but they didn't buy it.

Will: That's different. Don't worry about it. I'm s ure I'll get it straightened out. Worse comes to worst, we're only a month late. They  won't send the collection agency after us.

Grace: I know I can count on you to take care of it . I just don't want this late payment to affect our credit rating.

Will: Leave it to me. I'll take care of it on Monda y. It's as good as done.

[end of dialog]

In this podcast, we talk about paying the “bills.” The “bills” (bills) means the expenses or the things that you have to pay such as  your telephone and your electricity and your water. You have to pay the bil ls, the bills of your house. Well,

in this dialog, Grace, the woman, says, “Did you al ready pay the bills for this month?” And Will says, “No. I haven’t gotten around  to it yet.” “To get around to something” means that you are planning on doing it but you haven’t done it yet. Maybe because you don’t think it’s very important o r maybe because you’ve been so busy that you haven’t been able to do it. S o, that expression, “Have you got around to it yet?” “No. I haven’t,” means I hav en’t done it yet, but I am planning on doing it.

Well, Grace says that they received a “late notice”  from the credit card company. A “late notice (notice)” is when you do not pay you r credit card bill or any bill on time when you are supposed to. And after maybe five , ten days, the company will send you a “late notice,” telling you that you are late in paying the bill. The notice that Grace received says they haven’t received the payment yet, and it’s past the due date. The “payment” is (payment) the money that  they send to the company to pay your bill or pay their bill, in this case.

The “due date” – (due) “date” (date) – the “due dat e” is the day that something has to be paid. It is the deadline for when you hav e to pay a certain bill. To say something is “past the due date” is the same as say ing it’s “past due.” “It’s past due” (past) “due” (due) – is the same as it is afte r the day or the date that something has to be paid. Well, they’re being charg ed a “late fee” plus a “finance charge.” A “late fee” (fee) is extra money they hav e to pay because they are late. And a “finance charge” (finance) – a “finance charg e” is money – a percentage – that you have to pay on what you owe. This, of cour se is how credit card companies make money – one way they make money as t hat, if you don’t pay off or pay completely what you owe every month, you hav e a “finance charge.” And it’s like interest that you pay on a loan.

Well, Will says that he can’t believe what has happ ened. He says he paid the minimum payment on the last bill. The “minimum” (mi nimum) – the “minimum payment” is the least amount. So, for credit card c ompanies – VISA, Mastercard – they will say, “Well, you spent $500. You don’t h ave to pay us $500. This month you can pay us just $50 and we will charge yo u interest on the rest of the money. So, the $50 is the least amount – the minimu m payment. And if you pay the minimum payment, you don’t have a late fee. But  you do have a finance charge. Will says that “I better call and talk to c ustomer service tomorrow.” “I better call” (better) means “I ought to call.” “I s hould call.” And that’s a common way that we say that. For example, “You better go t o school” means you should, you ought to go to school. It’s somewhat informal.

Well, Will says, “I better call and talk to custome r service.” “Customer service” is the department in a company that takes care of its customers, that if you have a

problem or a complaint, these are the people you ca ll and you end up waiting on the telephone for many hours – that’s customer serv ice. “Customers” just, of course, another word for the person who is buying t he product or service. Will says that he’s sure it’s a “mix-up.” A “mix-up” (mi x-up) is a mistake. When someone says there was a “mix-up,” they mean there was some confusion. There was some problem, some error. Grace says that  she tried calling the credit card company the last time they were late and told them that the check was “in the mail.” That expression “The check is in the mai l” is sometimes used as a joke, meaning I have already sent you the money and  it is in the mail service – they haven’t delivered it yet. Many people say that , something as a joke because of course, you can always say, “Oh, yeah. I mailed the check already. You just have not received it.”

Well, according to Grace, the company – the credit card company – didn’t buy her reason, didn’t buy her excuse. She says, “They didn’t buy it.” In this case, “to buy” means to believe, not to purchase something wi th money – that’s also a use of the verb “to buy,” but here it means simply “to believe something,” usually something that is an excuse, perhaps or some explan ation that may not be true. We will sometimes say, “Well, she told me that she loved me, but I don’t buy it. I don’t believe it.” Isn’t that one of our great prob lems in the world? Well, Will says that this situation here is different, that he’s su re he can get it “straightened out.” To get something “straightened out” (straightened) – “to straighten something out” or “to get it straightened out” means to get i t fixed, to solve the problem, to end the confusion. If there was a mix-up, you can “ straighten it out” – means you can undo or tell the person what actually happened and end the confusion.

Will then says, “Worse comes to worst, we’re only a  month late.” The expression “worse (worse) comes to worst (worst)” means that i n the worst possible situation. We sometimes say, “Worst case scenario.”  A “scenario” (scenario) is like a situation. So, what he’s saying here is “Eve n if the worst thing” – and “worst,” of course, comes – bad, worse, worst, righ t? – something that is more bad is “worst.” We don’t say “more bad.” We say “wo rst” – something that is the worst situation is the most negative possible situa tion. So, “Worse comes to worst,” Will says, “we’re only a month late. They w on’t send the collection agency after us.” A “collection (collection) agency (agenc y)” – a “collection agency” – these are usually private companies that are respon sible for getting money that is owed to companies. So, when people don’t pay their bills, for many months, there will be a collection company that will call t hem, mail them, try to get them to pay their bills. These collection agencies take a p ercentage of how much the bill is, and that’s how they make money.

Well, Grace says that she knows she can “count on” Will. “To count on” means to rely on. She says, “I don’t want this late payment to affect our credit rating.” Your “credit (credit) rating (rating)” is the informatio n that companies look at when they want to see if you are good with your money – if yo u had paid your bills on time. And if you don’t, you can get a “bad credit rating. ” And in the United States, that’s very important because if you want to buy a house o r buy a car, and you have a bad credit rating, many companies will not give money to you. So, it’s important to have a good credit rating by paying your bills o n time. Will says to Grace, “Leave it to me,” meaning let me take care of it. I  will handle it. I will solve the problem. “It’s as good as done.” “It’s as good as d one” means you don’t have to worry about it. I’m going to do it and there’ll be no problems.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech. [start of dialog]

Grace: Did you already pay the bills for this month ?

Will: No, I haven't gotten around to it yet. Why?

Grace: We got a late notice from the credit card co mpany. The notice says that they haven't received the payment yet and it's past  the due date. We are being charged a late fee plus a finance charge of 15%.

Will: Let me see that. That can't be right. I paid the minimum payment on the last bill. I better call and talk to customer service to morrow. I'm sure it's a mix-up.

# Watching Sports on TV

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 149 – Watching Sports on TV.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 149. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to watch a little spor ts on TV. Let's go.

[start of dialog]

Laura: Oh, I didn't think I’d make it home in time for the game.

Jun: What game?

Laura: The playoffs! Turn on the TV. I hope it's st ill in the first quarter. It is! Who's winning? What's the score?

Jun: I don't know. You know I don't watch sports. W hoa! That was a great shot. Did you see that?

Laura: No, what happened? Maybe they'll show it aga in on instant replay. I wonder who the coach put in for the starting lineup .

Jun: Geez. I think there's a player down on the cou rt.

Laura: It looks like he's walking off the court. He  can't be hurt too badly.

Jun: Look! They're putting your favorite player in.  Oh, what a play!

Laura: Wait a second. I thought you didn't watch sp orts.

Jun: I was never a sports fan before I met you. I t hink you're a bad influence on me.

Laura: Yes, very bad. Now, stop hogging the couch a nd pass the chips.

[end of dialog]

In our dialog, Laura comes home and says to Jun, “O h, I didn't think I'd make it home in time for the game.” “To make it home” means  to arrive back at your house or your apartment. “In time” means in time for something, before something happens. “I hope to make it home in time for the baseball game, which starts at seven o'clock.” That means I hope t o get home before seven o'clock so I can watch the baseball game.

Jun doesn't know which game Laura is talking about.  He says, “What game?” Laura says, “The playoffs.” “Playoffs” (playoffs) i s when you have teams toward the end of their season, playing each other for the  championship. The championship is the game that determines which team  is the best team. If you have, for example, eight teams, you might have the four teams that have done the best during that particular season play each ot her in games that would be called “playoffs.” The “playoffs” are when you play  another team and the winning team gets to go on in the tournament, in the compet ition, so that they can get into the final game, the championship game, to determine  who the winner is.

In American football, for example, we have playoffs  that determine which two teams are going to go to the championship game call ed the Super Bowl. In baseball, we have playoffs that determine who will go into the World Series. All of these are examples of playoffs.

So, Laura is telling Jun that she came home to watc h the playoffs. She says, “Turn on the TV.” She says, “I hope it's still in t he first quarter.” There are some games, like American football or basketball, that a re divided into four parts. Each part is called a “quarter.” “Quarter” means 25% of something. We have a coin in the United States called a “quarter.” It's a quarte r of a dollar. It’s 25 cents. A dollar is a hundred cents. Well, we also have those  kinds of divisions in sports. In baseball, we don't have quarters. In baseball, we h ave what are called “innings” and there are nine of them, but in other sports, th ere are quarters, and Laura is hoping that the playoff game she wants to watch is still in the first quarter, meaning they haven't gone to the next quarter. The game is still being played in the very first part.

She says, “It is. Who's winning? What's the score?”  The “score” is the number of points that each team has. So, in football, the sco re could be something like 21 to 14, or 7 to 3. In basketball, it could be 87 to 75 or something like that. Jun says, “I don't know.” I don't know the score. “You know I do n't watch sports.”

But then, Jun, who's watching the television, gives  us an expression of surprise, usually of a happy surprise. He says, “Whoa! That w as a great shot.” In basketball, we use the word “shot,” when a player t akes the ball and throws it to

what's called the “net.” The net is the round hole that the ball has to go through. “Shot,” as a noun, is the throwing of the ball. The  verb is “to shoot” (shoot) and “shot” is the past tense of shoot. But here, it's u sed as a noun. Jun says, “That was a great shot. Did you see that?”

Laura, who apparently wasn't watching the televisio n even though she's the one who wanted to watch the playoffs, says, “No. What h appened? Maybe they'll show it again on instant replay.” The word “show,” when talking about television, can mean a program, a television program. It can al so be used as a verb to mean “to broadcast,” “to put up on the screen,” “to  let us see.” In this case, Laura is hoping that they will show or let everyone see t hat play, that great shot, again on instant replay.

“Instant” means right away. “Replay” means to play again. In sports, especially television sports, it's possible for them to show y ou a play again, right after it has happened, in case you missed it or to look at it mo re closely. “Instant replay” can be found in almost every sport now on television. L aura says, “I wonder who the coach put in for the starting lineup.” “I wonder” m eans I'm not sure. I'm not sure who the coach put in for the starting lineup. The “ coach” is the person who is responsible for running the team. The coach makes t he decisions about what the people playing the game will do. The people who pla y the game are called the “players.” The “starting lineup” is the group of pl ayers who begin the game. Usually, they're your best players. Your lineup is a list of the people who are going to be playing. Your starting lineup are the p eople who begin the game. So, Laura is wondering who the coach put in for the sta rting lineup. “To put in” here means to play, to actually say, “Okay. You go out a nd you play.”

Jun says, “Geez. I think there is a player down on the court.” “Geez” is a word we use for expressing surprise about something. Jun sa ys, “There is a player down on the court.” “Down” here means lying down, usuall y because they're injured, because they're hurt. The “court” (court) describes  the area where basketball is played. We use court also for the sport of tennis. We have the “tennis court”.  It’s the place where tennis is played. For football, we would call it a “field” – either a soccer field or an American football field. In base ball, it's also called a “field.” But in basketball, we use the word “court.”

Laura says, “It looks like he” – the player – “is w alking off the court.” “To walk off” means to leave, to exit. “He can't be hurt too badl y.” Laura means that that he must not have been injured very seriously, because he's able to stand up and walk off the court.

Jun says, “Look, they’re putting your favorite play er in.” Once again, we have that phrasal verb “to put in,” meaning to tell someone t o go and play. Laura's favorite player is now going to be playing in the game. Jun then says, “Oh, what a play!” A “play” here, as a noun, means some action in the sport that usually decides either the point being scored or some other importa nt part of the game. In basketball, making a shot that scores three points from a long distance away would be a great play. It would be a great part of the game, a great performance in the game.

Laura says, “Wait a second,” meaning wait a short a mount of time, wait a moment. “I thought you didn't watch sports.” Laura is surprised at how excited Jun is about watching this game, since he said earl ier that he didn't like to watch sports. Jun says, “I was never a sports fan before I met you.” A “sports fan” would be someone who likes to watch sports.

Jun says, “I think you're a bad influence on me.” S omething that is an “influence” on you is something that affects you, something tha t changes you somehow. Jun is saying that Laura is a bad influence on him. Her  actions have changed him for the worse. Of course, he's making a joke here. Laur a says, “Yes, very bad. Now, stop hogging the couch and pass the chips.” The “co uch” is the sofa. It's a large seat where, usually, three or more people can sit d own.

“To hog” (hog) is an informal verb meaning to use s omething so that no one else can use it. If you're hogging the couch, you're sit ting on the couch in such a way that no one else can sit on it. Maybe you're lying on it. “To pass the chips” means to give something to another person. In this case, the something is chips. Chips are potato chips, or corn chips, or tortilla chips,  that are very popular when people are watching sports. They’ll often eat potat o chips or some other kind of chip as food for when they're watching the game. So  Laura is telling Jun to stop hogging the couch. Let her sit down and give her so me chips so she can eat.

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Laura: Oh, I didn't think I’d make it home in time for the game.

Jun: What game?

Laura: The playoffs! Turn on the TV. I hope it's st ill in the first quarter. It is! Who's winning? What's the score?

Jun: I don't know. You know I don't watch sports. W hoa! That was a great shot. Did you see that?

Laura: No, what happened? Maybe they'll show it aga in on instant replay. I wonder who the coach put in for the starting lineup .

Jun: Geez. I think there's a player down on the cou rt.

Laura: It looks like he's walking off the court. He  can't be hurt too badly.

Jun: Look! They're putting your favorite player in.  Oh, what a play!

Laura: Wait a second. I thought you didn't watch sp orts.

Jun: I was never a sports fan before I met you. I t hink you're a bad influence on me.

Laura: Yes, very bad. Now, stop hogging the couch a nd pass the chips.

# Volunteer Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 150: Volunteer Work.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 150. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to learn about people who volunteer their time to help others. Let’s get started! > Some people say that it's civic duty to "give back"  to your community. That's true, but for me, I want to do some volunteer work so tha t I can feel useful. I've been working at the same job for years and it's not at a ll rewarding. Yes, I make good money, but I never feel like I'm doing any good in the world.

In this podcast, Lucy talks about volunteer work. S he begins by saying, “Some people say it’s civic duty to give back to your com munity.” “Civic (civic) duty (duty)” means that it is your responsibility as a c itizen of a country, as a member of a society, that you help other people. “Civic” ( civic) usually relates to the public helping people in a public way. “Duty” (duty) means  responsibility. So, it’s sort of your public responsibility to other people. “To giv e back” means that you are trying to repay or return to the larger public – wh at they have, perhaps, helped you with or given you. Lucy says that she wanted to  do some volunteer work so that she could feel useful. Although “work” (work) is normally something that we

think about as getting paid for, you can also have a “volunteer work” and (volunteer) “volunteer” is when you don’t get paid,  when you help someone because you want to help them.

She says that she’s been working at the same job an d that it’s not rewarding. “Rewarding” (rewarding) – something that is rewardi ng is something that you get a benefit from – that gives you something back for what you are doing, that you feel is important or useful. We can sometimes say, “That was a very rewarding trip if you were able to get something that you wan ted from it.” So, when Lucy says her work is “not at all rewarding,” she’s sayi ng that it is not rewarding very much or not rewarding at all. It’s not something th at is giving her pleasure or giving her a benefit.

She says that when she was in college, she had drea ms of changing the world and that’s probably pretty common. She said she wan ted to work in a “non-profit organization” that did relief work. A “non (non) pr ofit (profit)” – can be all one word or (non)-profit. A “nonprofit” is an organizat ion that doesn’t try to make money. It doesn’t try to have a profit. It’s not li ke a business. So, the Red Cross or the Crescent, the Red Crescent, are both example s of a nonprofit organization. “Relief work” (relief) – “relief work ” is the work that certain organizations like the Red Cross and Red Crescent –  these are organizations that help people who are in a disaster area – maybe  an area where there is war going on. These are examples of relief work.

One type of work that Lucy was interested in was he lping women and children in need or work that had an impact on public policy. T he expression “in need” (need) – “in need” – means that you need something,  usually because you are poor or because you had something bad happen to you  and now you need someone else to help you. Normally, though, we thin k about this expression “in need” as talking about someone who’s very poor or i n a very difficult situation.

To have an “impact on public policy” means to have in influence on the laws or programs of the government. “Public policy” really refers to anything that the government does – what their programs, their ideas – where they spend their money – these are all part of public policy. And th ere are many people who work to try to change the policy. My nephew, for example , works in Washington D.C – the capital of the United States – for a political organization, and he is trying to have an impact on public policy. He’s young – gradu ated from college – what we would say, “very idealistic.” “Idealistic” (idealis tic) – “idealistic” means that you believe that you can change the world. You have lot s of ideas and you want to convince other people to adopt or to put into place  your ideas – that would be “idealistic” – that’s the adjective. The person wou ld be an “idealist” and the idea

of “idealistic” would be “idealism” (idealism). So,  those are all words that we might talk about for those who want to change publi c policy.

Lucy decided that she was going to call an organiza tion that helped “homeless” children. “Homeless” (homeless) refers to people wh o don’t have a home – people who are living without a permanent home. And  unfortunately, in the United States, as in many countries, there is a hom eless – a large homeless population. Here in Los Angeles, for example, if yo u go to some parts of the city, you will see people who are living on the street an d one of the things that many volunteer organizations try to do is help those who  do not have anywhere to go. In the case of Lucy, she said that she wanted to do  some “tutoring.” “To tutor” (tutor) is when you help someone in school. Usually , tutoring is done “one-on- one.” “One-on-(on)-one” – and “one-on-one” means th ere’s just you, as the tutor, and the student that you are helping.– There’re jus t two people.

Well, she had to fill out an application for this t utoring work. An “application” is what we call the paper that you put your informatio n on. If you want to get a job, you often have to fill out an application. If you want to get a credit card, you have to fill out an application. In this case, Lucy want s to volunteer so she has to fill out an application. Notice the verb there “to fill out”  – two words – means to put information on an application. The verb is “to appl y.” So, “I’m applying for a job,” or “I’m applying for a position” – that means you’r e trying to get it.

Well, as is true for all teachers in California and  in many other states, you have to get “fingerprinted.” “Fingerprint” (fingerprint) is  a verb. It’s also a noun. And as you probably can guess, it means that you have to t ake your fingers and now, it’s done by a computer electronically. They “scan” (sca n) – means they like take a picture – similar to taking a picture – of your fin gers and, of course, everyone has a unique set of fingerprints – that’s the mark that  your fingers make when you touch something. We use fingerprints, for example, to find criminals. If they left their fingerprints, we say. We look at them and we try to match them. Well, part of the security for schools and for children is to have people who work there, including the teachers – need to get fingerprinted and then an organization, usually a private company, will do a search and the y will look at all of the criminal records because, if you commit a crime in the Unite d States – you do something wrong and you’re arrested, meaning the police take you and put you in jail, they will fingerprint you and they keep a big database –  a big list of all these fingerprints on computer and then if you are a crim inal, they don’t want you working with children. So, that’s why teachers and others get “fingerprinted” in the United States if you are working at a school an d for other things as well.

Getting fingerprinted is part of a “background chec k.” A “background (background) check (check)” – a “background check” is when someone looks into your background, your history – make sure you weren ’t a criminal or that you haven’t had problems with the police – that’s a bac kground check.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech.

[start of story]

Some people say that it's civic duty to "give back"  to your community. That's true but for me, I want to do some volunteer work so tha t I can feel useful. I've been working at the same job for years and it's not at a ll rewarding. Yes, I make good money, but I never feel like I'm doing any good in the world.

When I was in college, I had dreams of changing the  world. I wanted to work in a non- profit organization that did relief work, th at helped women and children in need, or that had an impact on public policy. I've begun to think again about those dreams and thought I might take the first ste p of doing some volunteering. Then, I can see if I like that kind of work and mak e some hard decisions.

I called an organization that helped homeless child ren. I told them about my education and experience, and they said they could use someone like me to do some tutoring. I filled out an application and was fingerprinted for a background check. A few weeks later, I met my student and I tu tored her for the first time. It was a great experience. I wish I had done it earlie r!

# Eating at a Buffet

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 151: Eating at a Buffet.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  151. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, and as usual , in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we are going to eat and eat a lot.  Let’s get started! > I love eating at all-you-can-eat buffets. It doesn' t matter what kind of food it is, I'm up for it.
> Last week, I went to a high-end seafood buffet with  my friends. We walked in and the hostess seated us at a table. She asked if we wanted to order any drinks. Drinks other than water are not included in the pri ce.
> I got up and got a plate. I went over to the soup a nd salad station first and then over to the hot food. They had a carving station an d made-to-order omelets. They also had a great dessert table, but I wasn't r eady for that yet. I sat down, ate, and grabbed a new plate for the second round. This time, I went for the seafood. I loaded up my plate and sat down again. A fter two more trips to the buffet, I was ready for dessert. I got a little of everything. I was so stuffed, I couldn't eat another bite.
> I really enjoyed the meal. I like being able to ser ve myself. Some people don't like buffets unless they're very high-end. Not me. Give me any high-end or low-end buffet and I'm perfectly happy.

In this podcast, we get to eat. It’s called “Eating  at a Buffet.” And a “buffet” is spelled (buffet). A “buffet” is a restaurant or a p lace in a restaurant where they have food and you go and get whatever food you want  and put it on your plate. And usually, these are “all-you-can-eat.” “All-you- can-eat” means you can take as much food as you want. You can’t take it home. You have to eat it there. But “all- you-can-eat buffets” are very popular in the United  States – that’s probably why there are so many fat Americans. The most popular b uffets are “Indian” buffets –

Indian food and “Chinese” buffets with Chinese food , though there are also a few Japanese buffets and other types of general buffets  with different types of food.

Well, in the story, I say that “It doesn’t matter w hat kind of food it is” – it’s not important – “I’m up for it.” “To be up (up) for (fo r) something” means that you are ready for it, that you are willing to do it. “I’m u p for going hiking.” “I’m up for walking in the park.” I say that “Last week, I went  to a high-end seafood buffet.” When we say something his “high” (high) – “end” (en d)” – we mean that is expensive or that it is considered to be among the top most expensive type of, in this case, buffet. You can also talk about high-end  stores – stores that sell very expensive things – things that cost lots of money. So, a “high-end seafood buffet,” of course, would be one that had seafood –  types of fish. Well, you walk into a buffet and the hostess “seats you.” The “hos tess” is, of course, the person who is at the front of the restaurant near the door  that takes you to your seat. And there’s actually a verb which is “to seat someo ne” (seat) – means to show them to their table – usually, at a restaurant. It also can be used in a theater, for example, where the person who takes you to your sea t is called an “usher” (usher). In a restaurant, that person is called the  “hostess” if it’s a woman and a “host” (host) if it’s a man.

The “hostess” asks if the people in the story wante d any drinks. And at a buffet, typically, you get the food free, but if you want s oda or something else to drink other than – except, that is – water – you have to pay extra for it – pay separately. That’s why the story says, “Drinks are not included in the price.” They’re not part of the price. So, if you go to a C hinese buffet that cost $10 a person – which is about a typical price for a buffe t - $8, $10. Here in Los Angeles, a high-end buffet, a more expensive buffet , might be $15 or $20. If you go to a buffet like that you probably will have to pay $1.50 or maybe $2 to get a Coca-Cola or some other type of soda.

Well, in the story, it says that “I got up and got a plate and I went over to the soup and salad station.” A “station” (station), when we are talking about a buffet, is a part of the buffet. It’s like the area of that part icular type of food. And this was soup and salad. “Then I went to the hot food. They had a carving station there.” A “carving station” (carving) is a place where they h ave a big piece of meat – usually beef or maybe ham or pork. And they have so meone cutting it for you and giving you the pieces that you want. Another wo rd for cutting a piece of meat is “to carve a piece of meat.” So, on Thanksgiving,  for example, we carve a turkey – that is, we cut the meat off of the turkey .

There was also a station for “made to order omelets .” An “omelet” (omelet) is, you probably know, eggs, usually with a little milk   or something, and they mix

together and you put them in a frying pan to cook t hem. Usually, you put other things in there like ham or cheese or tomatoes – th at’s my favorite kind of omelet. Well, at a buffet, they have “made to order omelets .” So, they have someone standing with a frying pan and you go up to them an d say, “I want a ham, cheese, tomato omelet.” And they will make it for y ou right there and give it to you.

They also had a great dessert table and a “dessert”  (dessert), of course, the sweet things, sugary things, that you eat after a m eal. I say that “I sat down and I ate and then I grabbed a new plate for the second r ound.” “To grab” (grab) means to take, in this case. So, I took another pla te. I picked up another plate and I went for a second round. A “round” here means  (round) – means a second time that I eat – a second serving. Normally, we ta lk about rounds in, for example, a boxing match. A boxing – where two peopl e are boxing each other – they usually have several rounds – 15 rounds I thin k. And each round is very short – 2 or 3 minutes. Well, we use that same expr ession here, sort of as a joke. I went for my second round. Notice that you have to  take a new plate. When you eat at a public restaurant – at a buffet – once you  sit down and start to eat from your plate, you can’t use that same plate again. So , if you go to a buffet in the United States and you get your food and you sit dow n and eat it, and you want more food, you leave your plate on the table and yo u go get another plate – a new plate – and you do that each time you go and ge t food.

Well, I say that I loaded up my plate. “To load up”  (load) up (up) means to put a lot of things on there. We can use that verb “to lo ad up,” for example, if we are moving. And we need to put some boxes in a truck or  in a car. We can “load up” the car – means we fill it up – we put lots of thin gs in it. Well, here, “loading up your plate” means to put a lot of food on your plat e. I then say that after two more trips to the buffet, I was ready for dessert. And a  “trip” here just means the same as a round – two more times going to get food. I sa id, “I got a little of everything” – means a small amount of many different things. “I  was so stuffed, I couldn’t eat another bite.” “To be stuffed” (stuffed) means that  you’ve eaten so much that you are not just full, but you are very full. Someone s ays, perhaps, “I stuffed myself at the buffet” – means I ate a lot – too much. I say t hat “I couldn’t eat another bite” – means I could not eat another piece of food. A “bit e” (bite) of food is a piece of food. We also use that word “bite” as a verb” and t hat’s what your teeth do when they chew on something –when you put a piece of foo d in your mouth, you can bite it, meaning that your teeth come together.

I said I enjoyed my meal and that “To me, I could g o to any high-end or low-end buffet.” And “low-end” (low-end), is of course, the  opposite of high-end. A “low- end” buffet would be a cheap or inexpensive buffet.

 Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech. > I love eating at all-you-can-eat buffets. It doesn' t matter what kind of food it is, I'm up for it.
> Last week, I went to a high-end seafood buffet with  my friends. We walked in and the hostess seated us at a table. She asked if we wanted to order any drinks. Drinks other than water are not included in the pri ce.
> I got up and got a plate. I went over to the soup a nd salad station first and then over to the hot food. They had a carving station an d made-to-order omelets. They also had a great dessert table, but I wasn't r eady for that yet. I sat down, ate, and grabbed a new plate for the second round. This time, I went for the seafood. I loaded up my plate and sat down again. A fter two more trips to the buffet, I was ready for dessert. I got a little of everything. I was so stuffed, I couldn't eat another bite.

# Planning a Company Retreat

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 152: Planning a Company Retreat.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 152. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to talk about planning  a meeting or a retreat for your company. Let’s go!

[start of dialog]

Sharon: So, Leo, how are the plans coming along for  the company retreat?

Leo: I've made most of the arrangements and I think  it's going well. I'm planning to send out information about the two-day event to the managers at the end of this week.

Sharon: What do you have set up for the opening day ? There's normally a welcome dinner.

Leo: That's what I have arranged. Then, for the fol lowing day, I've lined up several speakers and panels to talk about produc tivity, teamwork, and the other topics we discussed.

Sharon: Good. What about recreation? We don't want it to be all work and no play.

Leo: The hotel where we're holding the retreat this  year has golf and water sports. I don't think the managers will be bored.

Sharon: Well, it sounds like you have it all under control. Keep up the good work.

Leo: Thanks.

[end of dialog]

In this podcast, we heard a conversation between Sh aron and Leo, talking about a company retreat. A “retreat” (retreat) in this si tuation means a meeting. It’s a meeting that companies have, usually somewhere away  from their office. These

are often meetings to do planning, thinking about t he future, that sort of thing. In many American – big American companies, they have r etreats at a hotel somewhere, sometimes in a different city even, if i t’s just for the executives, for the most important bosses. The word “retreat” as a noun and a verb, is also used in talking about a war – when you are in a battle w ith some other army and the army retreats – that means the army goes back. It p ulls back towards its own territory or its own country.

Well, in this dialog, Sharon asks Leo, how the plan s are “coming along” for the company retreat. That expression “to come along” me ans how are they developing, how are they turning out, how are they progressing – those are all ideas for this expression “to come along.” “To come  along” can also mean to “accompany,” to go with someone. But when someone s ays, “How are your plans coming along?” – they mean how are they developing?  Are they progressing – going forward – the way you want them to? Leo says that he’s made most of the “arrangements” and he thinks it’s going well. The “ arrangements” are all of the things that he has to do – making reservations, tal king to the hotel, talking to the airline – if they’re going somewhere else. So, thes e are all parts of “arrangements.” “Arrangements” (arrangements) is an ything that you have to do when you are planning a meeting, an event. You can make arrangements for a wedding, or make arrangements for a meeting.

Leo says that he’s “planning to send out informatio n” about the two-day event to managers at the end of this week. He’s “planning to ” means he’s intending to, he has the intention, he wants to send out information  about the two-day event. “Two-day” (two-day) is the same as the event of two  days. But we often use the hyphen form “two-day event,” “one-day event” – to d escribe something. Notice that we don’t say, “The two days event.” You might think that it should be plural, but in fact, it’s singular when there is a hyphen a nd it is used more or less as an adjective. So, “I’m going to a four-day retreat” me ans the retreat is going to be four days long.

Sharon asks Leo what he has “set up” for the openin g day. “To set up” (set up) is another one of those two-word verbs. It means to ar range. It means to plan. It can also mean sometimes to “put into place.” So, for example, we’ve set up the room for our meeting. We’ve moved the tables and pu t the chairs in the correct position – that could be set up. Here, when Sharon says, “What do you have setup for the opening day?” she means what do you h ave planned? What events – what will happen? The “opening day” is, of course , the first day of the retreat. We use that word “opening” to mean first – usually,  if it’s the first day of a long event. You also will hear that expression, for exam ple, for a sports season. “Opening day,” for baseball is the first day of the  official baseball season which

should be very soon I think. You can also have the opening day of school – it’s the first day.

Sharon says, “There’s normally a welcome dinner,” m eaning an opening dinner – a beginning dinner to welcome people to the event. Leo says that that is exactly what he has arranged. And “to arrange” (arrange) is  the verb of arrangements. So, we talked about arrangements. Well, this is the  verb form “to arrange.” Leo says that “For the next day” – for the following da y – the day after the opening day – he’s lined up several speakers and panels. “T o line up” (line up) – two words – means very much the same as to plan or to a rrange. “I’ve lined up some people.” We usually use that expression when we are  talking about arranging for people to talk to a group. I’ve lined up some good speakers. I’ve lined up some good presenters and so, we use that verb often when  talking about getting people to talk to a group. “Speakers,” of course, a re people who speak to a large group. And company retreats in the United States, o ften bring in what are called “motivational speakers,” or “inspirational speakers .” And these are speakers who are not necessarily experts on the company. They do n’t necessarily know a lot about the company, but they’re very good at talking  to people and getting them interested and excited about something. And they’ll  often be very good speakers – very interesting speakers to listen to.

Well, in addition to having speakers, Leo has also lined up some “panels.” A “panel” (panel) is when you have a group of people – usually sitting at a table, behind a table, in the front of a room and each per son has a microphone in front of them and you have a discussion among the people,  about a certain topic. So, you may have an expert from different areas come in  and each of them would be on a panel of four or five people and they will tal k about a topic like a discussion with each other so that people can listen to them.

Well, the speakers and panels that Leo has lined up  are going to talk about productivity and teamwork. “Productivity” is a very  common word you will read when companies talk about how they are doing – if t hey are making money. “Productivity” (productivity) is a noun and it mean s how hard the people in the company are working, how much they are producing. I f they spend 8 hours working, how much work do they get done – how much work do they finish – that’s “productivity.” The adjective would be “prod uctive.” If you say, “I am productive” that means “I’m getting something done, ” or “We had a productive meeting” means we got a lot accomplished. We manage d to do a lot at the meeting. That rarely happens, of course. Meetings a re usually not very productive. The opposite of productive is “unproduc tive” (un) – “unproductive.”

“Teamwork” – all one word – (teamwork) – “teamwork”  is the idea that people work together just like a team. And once again, Ame rican companies like to talk about teamwork – everyone working together. There’s  an expression “Be a team player.” “Be a team (team) player” means work toget her with other people, get along with other people, don’t argue with other peo ple – that’s being a team player.

Sharon asks about the “recreation” for the retreat.  “Recreation” means enjoyment – things that people can do – usually something phy sical like a sport. But it could be other things as well. “Recreation” is (recreatio n). There is a verb “to recreate” but it’s not used very often. The noun is much more  common. Sharon says that she doesn’t want the meeting to be “all work and no  play.” “All work and no play” means, of course, that they only work and they don’ t have time to play. But that’s sort of an expression. “I don’t want it to be all w ork and no play.” Leo says that the hotel where they’re “holding” the retreat – “to  hold” here means the same as to have. We often use it for meetings. “Where is the meeting being held?” “Where are we holding the meeting?” means where is it goin g to be.

Well, the hotel where they’re holding the retreat h as golf and water sports. “Golf,” of course, you all know – the sport that Tiger Wood s plays and other people. “Water sports” refers to skiing and swimming and do ing things, obviously, in the water. Sharon says, “It sounds good. It sounds like  you have it all under control.” “To have something under control” means that you are able to manage it, that nothing is being forgotten. “Everything is under co ntrol” – I have everything planned, everything has been taken care of – is ano ther way of saying that. Finally, Sharon says, “Keep up the good work.” That ’s a very common expression when you want to tell someone to continu e doing the good work that they are doing. “Keep up the good work.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

Sharon: So, Leo, how are the plans coming along for  the company retreat?

Leo: I've made most of the arrangements and I think  it's going well. I'm planning to send out information about the two-day event to the managers at the end of the week.

Sharon: What do you have set up for the opening day ? There's normally a welcome dinner.

Leo: That's what I have arranged. Then, for the fol lowing day, I've lined up several speakers and panels to talk about produc tivity, teamwork, and the other topics we discussed.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 153: A Complaint Letter to a Tour Company.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 153. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is called “A Complaint Letter to a Tour Company. Let’s listen!

[start of letter]

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing regarding a tour that my wife and I to ok with your company on February 26, 2006. The brochure stated that we woul d see some of the most interesting sights of the city. Since we had visite d the city before, we looked forward to seeing some new attractions.

On the morning of February 26, our tour guide picke d us up in a small van. It did not look like any tour bus I had ever seen. Our tou r guide drove us to the waterfront area and said that we could explore the area on our own. The tour guide said that he had to leave for a short time to  arrange for our lunch.

By the time the tour guide came back, three hours h ad gone by! I was very angry and confronted him. I told him that this was the wo rst tour I had ever been on.

I am asking for a complete refund of the price of t he tour. Please send a check to the address above for $150.00 at your earliest conv enience. I have enclosed a copy of the receipt for the tour.

We listened to a complaint letter in this podcast. A “complaint letter” (complaint) is a letter that you send a company or organization  to tell them that they did something wrong. The verb is “to complain” (complai n). And here we have the word “complaint” to describe the letter. Now, this is a tour company – a company

that arranges and takes people who are visiting to different places. The letter begins with “To Whom It May Concern:” “To Whom (who m) It May Concern:” – the entire expression is capitalized. So, every wor d: “To Whom It May Concern” begins with a capital letter. This is what we use i n, many times, in a business letter, when we don’t know who to write the letter to. You don’t know if it’s Mr. Smith or Ms. Jones. You don’t have a name of a pers on to write the letter to. So, what we are saying in “To Whom It May Concern” is t o the person who is responsible for what I am talking about in my lette r. So, that’s a very common way to open a business letter when you don’t know t he person or a person in that particular organization or company. It ends with a colon and we use a colon in a formal business letter, instead of a coma. Even if you know the name and it’s a formal business letter, you would still use a colon  – “Dear Dr. Johnson:” If it’s a friendly letter, an informal letter, then we would use a coma – “Dear John,” for example.

Well, the first paragraph of the letter begins by s aying, “I am writing regarding a tour that my wife and I took with your company.” Th at word “regarding” (regarding) means I am writing about something. So,  here the word “regarding” just means about. “I want to talk to you regarding the money that is missing from my wallet” – that would be the same as “I want to t alk to you about that topic.” It’s a little more formal. It’s a little more common in a business situation to use that word “regarding.” Sometimes in a business letter, y ou will see the top of the letter will have the address – name and address – of the p erson you are writing. And then you’ll see a line – a space – and the next lin e will say, “RE:” and then some short phrase – couple of words. The “RE:” there mea ns “regarding.” So, you’re saying, “Here’s what the subject of this letter is. ” It’s sort of like in an email. You have a subject line, where you tell somebody what t he subject is, using “RE:” in the top of the letter. It goes between the address and what we call the “salutation” – the greeting. So, here the salutatio n is, “To Whom It May Concern:” It could be, “Dear Dr. Johnson.” So it goes above t hat and below the address, and again it means “regarding.”

Well, back to the letter. The letter says that “The  brochure for the tour stated that we would see some of the most interesting sights of  the city.” The “brochure” (brochure) is a description of the tour. It’s usual ly on a nice piece of color paper with photographs – that’s a brochure. You can have a brochure for a tour. You can have a brochure for your company to tell people  what it is that you do. You can use a brochure for any of those things. The bro chure “stated” (stated) – that simply means the brochure “said” – past tense of the verb to state, is to say. “The brochure stated that we would see some of the most interesting sights of the city.” Notice the use of the grammatical constructi on here, “would see,” meaning because we’re saying stated in the past, we use the  verb “would see” here – that

word “would” – means that it is thinking about the future but in the past. It’s a little confusing. “He told me he would go to the store.” S o, he said that to me yesterday but when he said it to me, he was talking  about the future. So, in this sentence it says, “The brochure stated” – in the pa st – “that we would see” – thinking about the future – “some of the most inter esting sights of the city.

A “sight” (sight) is an interesting place. Someone says, “I want to see the sights of Los Angeles” means they want to see the most int eresting things in Los Angeles, like the beaches and the Hollywood stars a nd Jeff McQuillan’s house. You know – all of the famous things. So, the letter  continues – “Since we had visited the city before, we looked forward to seein g some new attractions.” “Attractions” (attractions) – an “attraction” is ju st a famous or interesting place that someone who is visiting would want to see.

Well, the next paragraph begins – “On the morning of February 26.” Notice the use there of “on.” “On the morning of.” We don’t sa y, “In the morning of.” And the reason is that we are talking about a time during a  specific day. “On the evening of July 27th,” “On the afternoon of May 3rd,” “On t he morning of February 26th” – that just means in that period of time, but for a s pecific day. If you say, “In the morning,” you’re usually talking about a specific t ime. “I am going to leave at 6 o’clock in the morning. But you would not say, “I’m  going to leave at 6 o’clock on the morning.” You would say, “In the morning” when there’s a specific time. You would not say, “In the morning of February 26th.” You have to say, “On the morning.”

The letter continues – “Our tour guide picked us up  in a small van.” Well, the “tour guide” (guide) is the person who is responsib le for the tour, who is giving the tour, who is telling you about all the differen t sights and attractions. “The tour guide picked us up,” meaning they came with their v an or their big car and we got into their car. When you say, “Someone’s going to p ick me up,” you mean they’re going to drive over to where you are and take you w ith them in their car. Now, this is not a car but it’s a “van” (van). And a “va n” – it’s like a big car or big truck that you can put many different people in there – f ive, six, maybe ten people in a big van. Well, the letter says that this van did no t look like any tour bus I had ever seen. A “tour bus,” obviously, is a bigger vehicle that you can put many more people in – looks the same as any other kind of bus . “The tour guide drove us down to the waterfront area.” The “waterfront” (wat erfront) – all one word – “waterfront” is, of course, down in the area next t o some water, like the ocean or a river, or a lake – all of those could have “water front.” If someone says to you, “I have waterfront property.” That means they own land  near the water – that’s right on or touches whatever water you’re talking about.

Well, the tour guide said that they should explore the area on their own. “To explore” here just means to look around, to go by y ourself, and look. “On your own,” means by yourself, without the tour guide. We ll, the tour guide then said, he was going to “leave to arrange for our lunch,” m eaning to make plans for our lunch. “By the time the tour guide came back, three  hours had gone by.” “By the time” – that expression means at the hour, at the t ime that the tour guide came back. But we use that expression “By the time” when  it’s been a long time and we are going to say something – usually often that has  a negative outcome – a negative result. “By the time my brother came over to my house, all of the work was already done.” “I asked him to come over and he lp me, but by the time he got here, the work was finished.” So, we’re using t hat expression “By the time” with the idea that a long time has gone by - has pa ssed -  and something bad has happened because the person was very late. Usua lly, we use this when someone is late for a meeting or an event. In this case, three hours had gone by. “To go by” – when we say “Time goes by” (goes) (by)  – or here, in the past – “gone” – “had gone by” – means that it has passed, that it is over. Three hours “went by,” meaning we were there for three hours.

Well, obviously, he’s very angry and the person in the letter here, Kanye East, says, “I confronted him.” I confronted the tour gui de. “To confront” (confront) – “to confront someone” means that you talk to them, but usually in order to complain about something or because you are angry. So, that verb “to confront” has a negative meaning again, just like “By the time.” Wh en we say, “I confronted him” – means I went up to him. I talk to him and I proba bly said something negative, something like a complaint to him.

Well, the letter ends by the person asking for a “c omplete refund” of the price of the tour. A “refund,” of course, (refund) is when a  company gives you money back. A “complete refund” would mean you want all of the money that you spent back. And the expression used here is the “complete  refund of the price of the tour,” meaning of the money. So, we wouldn’t say, “ A complete refund of the money of the tour,.” we would say, “Of the price of  the tour.” He asks in the letter that the company send the check to the address abov e – that means to the address that’s on the top of the letter which would , of course, be your address. So, send the check to the address above or the addr ess, rather, above. Notice the pronunciation there. If it’s a noun, it’s “addr ess.” If it’s a verb, it’s “address.” So, “I’m going to address a letter” means I’m going  to write the person’s address on the letter. Well, he asked for the refund to be sent at your “earliest convenience” – that’s an expression we use in a bus iness letter to mean “as soon as possible” – right away. “I want my money no w man.” “At your earliest convenience” is a polite way of saying, “I want you  to do this right away” – soon.

He says he’s “enclosed” a copy of the receipt. “To enclose in a letter” (enclose) means to put with the letter. So, if you “enclose” the receipt, you put the letter in an envelope and the receipt in the same envelope – that’s to enclose. And often on a business letter, at the bottom of the letter, you’ll see the words “ENC.” And after that, it will say. “Receipt,” or the name of a document, the name of another piece of paper that’s with the letter – telling you  that there is an enclosure – and that is the noun. An “enclosure” (enclosure) is wha t you enclose or put with a letter when you send it.

The letter ends with “Sincerely,” and that is a bus iness way, a polite way, of ending a letter – “Sincerely,” – you can also say, “Sincerely yours,” and “Sincerely” is capitalized – (Sincerely) but “yours ” is not capitalized. So, there’s a capital S for sincerely – a small “y” for “yours” c oma.

Now let’s listen to the letter this time at a nativ e rate of speech.

[start of letter]

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing regarding a tour that my wife and I to ok with your company on February 26, 2006. The brochure stated that we woul d see some of the most interesting sights of the city. Since we had visite d the city before, we looked forward to seeing some new attractions.

On the morning of February 26, our tour guide picke d us up in a small van. It did not look like any tour bus I had ever seen. Our tou r guide drove us to the waterfront area and said that we could explore the area on our own. The tour guide said that he had to leave for a short time to  arrange for our lunch.

By the time the tour guide came back, three hours h ad gone by! I was very angry and confronted him. I told him that this was the wo rst tour I had ever been on.

I am asking for a complete refund of the price of t he tour. Please send a check to the address above for $150.00 at your earliest conv enience. I have enclosed a copy of the receipt for the tour.

Sincerely, Kanye East

# Using Email

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 154: Using Email.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 154. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to talk about somethin g that everyone uses – who listens to this podcast, I would guess – email. Let ’s get started! > One of the first things I do each morning is to che ck my email. I open the email program on my computer and I check for new messages . It usually takes only a few seconds for my new messages to download from the server into my inbox unless there’s a large attachment. I can then click  onto each new message to read it.
> I reply to messages or forward them to someone else . The important messages I save by putting them into one of my mailboxes. The unimportant ones I just delete.
> I really hate getting spam. Luckily, my email progr am allows me to set up filters so that spam messages are put into a separate mailb ox automatically. I usually scan the messages to make sure real messages weren’ t put into the mailbox by mistake and then I put them in the trash.
> I don’t know what I would do without email, but I’m  constantly checking for new messages. I’m not sure if it’s a blessing or a curs e. I suppose it’s both.

Today’s podcast talks about using email. It begins by saying, “One of the first things I do each morning is to check my email.” Not ice the use of “each” here. It’s the same as “every.” “I do this every morning.” “To  check,” of course, is a common verb in English – it can mean to investigate . It can mean, in this case, to look at or to read. So, “I check my email.” Most pe ople in the world check their email on a computer, but, of course, you can check your email on a cell phone now. In fact, there’s a very popular  in the United  States called the “Blackberry” (Blackberry). And a “Blackberry” is a type of cell phone that has email and it has a little keyboard that you can respond to email wit h. And it is very popular among

business people. Well, I don’t have a Blackberry bu t I do have a computer and I open my email program. Notice we use the verb “open ” for program – a software program. “I open the email program on my computer a nd I check for new messages.” We say, “I’m going to check my email,” o r “I checked my email yesterday.” But if you use the word “messages,” we say “check for.” “I’m going to check for new messages on my email.”

“It usually takes only a few seconds,” I said, “for  my new messages to download from the server.” “To download” – you probably know  – (download) – means that it goes on to your computer. It goes from another c omputer, which we call a “server,” onto your computer. The “server” (server)  is a big computer. You can think of it as a big computer where you have many t hings that are stored. And you can download from that server. Of course, it’s more complicated than that but that’s a simple way of thinking about a server.  It’s another computer that you get things from. Well, when you download an email m essage, it goes into your “inbox” (inbox) – “inbox” – and that is the place w here your messages are on your computer – in your email program. The word “in box” is actually an old word. It was not invented for email. We have always had “ inboxes” – “inboxes” and “outboxes” – and they are essentially, little place s – a tray, or a basket where people in an office can put papers for someone. So,  for example, if I’m working and I have an inbox, my boss could put things in my  inbox that I would check to see what I was supposed to do next. And when I was done, I would put them in the “outbox” (outbox) – all one word. So, we have a n “inbox,” and an “outbox.”

Well, one of the things you can send via email – th at is, through email, is “attachments.” An “attachment” (attachment) is anot her file. It could be an mp3 file. You can email your friend a song or ESL Podca st. An “attachment” can also be a word document – a Microsoft Word or text docum ent of some sort. In order to read your email, you want to “click onto” each n ew message. “To click onto” here means the same as to click on but you can say either “click on,” or “click onto.” “Click on the link,” for example, on a webpa ge will take you to a different web page. You can click onto the link. It really me ans the same thing. I think we use both, in this case.

I continue saying that “I reply to messages or forw ard them to someone else.” Of course, “to reply” is to send a message back to tha t person, or “to forward them” would be to send it to a third person, another pers on. You can send things by putting them “CC” to someone else. So, for example,  if you reply to someone, you want to send it to a third person – that’s usin g the “CC” or if you don’t want anyone to know who you are sending it to, you can “ BCC.” “CC” stands for – well, in the old days, back when I was a child – “CC” sto od for “Carbon Copy” – “carbon (carbon) copy” – and that’s because if you wanted to make a copy on a

typewriter, you had to put two pieces of paper in a nd in between the two pieces of paper, you put a little black sheet that had “ca rbon” on it, in order to – so, when you hit the typewriter key, it would make a mark on  the first page and also on the second page. Well, we don’t have carbon copies anym ore, but we still use that abbreviation “CC.” In fact, you can also use “CC” a s a verb. Some people will say, “Please CC me on that,” or “Please CC your wif e on that.” The other abbreviation we use is “BCC.” And “B” as in “blind”  carbon copy. So, a “blind CC,” or “BCC” – it’s blind because no one can see w ho you are sending it to.

Well, after I either reply or forward a message, I “save” messages into one of my “mailboxes.” Once again, “mailbox” (mailbox) – all one word – is a word we had before the Internet, before email. The “mailbox” is  what the postal carrier – what we would call the “mail carrier” – puts your mail i nto. When you have unimportant email messages, and most of the messages we get see m to be unimportant, those you can just “delete” (delete) – of course, m eans that you get rid of them. You delete them. Notice that we say, “I just delete .” The idea here is that I don’t do anything else with them. So, when someone says, “Just get me a glass of water” – what they’re saying is you don’t have to g ive me anything else. All that I want – the only thing I want – is a glass of water.  However, we can’t use “only” here. You can’t say, “I only delete.” It’s not a pr oper use of the word only in this particular situation. We would use “just.”

Well, I say, “I hate getting spam,” and of course, you all know, “spam” (spam) is mail that you don’t want. I talked about “spam” on another podcast and I received several emails of people telling me it came from the Monty Python – the British humor sketch – where they sang a song with spam.

[singing]

Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam

You know, that one. And it’s a very famous comedy s ketch – a comedy performance that was in a television show from Engl and. Okay, back to the story.

I said that “Luckily,” or “Fortunately, my email pr ogram allows me to set up filters.” “To set up” (setup) – two words – “to set  up” means to prepare, to get ready. We use the verb “set up” for lots of things.  You can “set up” your computer. You can “set up” a computer program. We p robably would say, “Install.” “To install,” (install) of course means to take a piece of software and put it on your computer. After you install it, you have  to set it up, which means you have to, perhaps, put in some other information int o the program.

Well, you can “set up,” or arrange “filters” in you r email. And a “filter” (filter) is something that stops something else. Once again, th is is a word – a general word in English that we use. “To filter something” means to prevent something from going through. The idea is that something does  go through and something doesn’t go through. So, for example, if you are coo king – well, a better example – if you are making coffee, you put the coffee – we w ould say the “coffee grounds” (grounds) – that’s the coffee that’s in very fine –  like a powder. And you put the coffee grounds into a coffee filter. The water goes  through and, of course, it becomes coffee. It turns into coffee. It has the fl avor of coffee. But the coffee grounds do not go through. So, you can use that wor d in many different cases. You can even say, “He’s filtering my messages.” “He ’s filtering my communication” – that is, he’s stopping me, prevent ing me from communicating with someone else.

Well, in this case, “I usually scan my messages to make sure that real messages weren’t put into my spam mailbox.” “To scan” (scan)  means to look at quickly. Not to read every single thing, but to look at quic kly. And we use this verb for things other than email. You can scan the newspaper . You can scan the phonebook, looking for a telephone number – means t o look very quickly. Well, I scan my messages and when I am sure that no real me ssages are in my spam mailbox, I put everything in the “trash.” And, of c ourse, the “trash” (trash) is where you delete things, where you want to get rid of it. Again, we use the word “trash” in a non email context as well. I am standi ng next to a trash bucket – that’s a place where we put things that we don’t wa nt like. For example, bills from the phone company – just put those in the trash.

Now, “I don’t know what I would do without email” –  this is also a common expression, “I don’t know what I would do without y ou,” “without my computer,” “without my wife.” I would be lost without my wife.  I’m very sure. So, “you don’t know what you would do without,” meaning I can’t im agine a situation where I did not have this thing, or this person. I say that “I’ m constantly checking my email for new messages” – once again, “to check for new m essages.” “Constantly,” of course, (constantly) is an adverb meaning “all the time” – over and over again. I end the story by saying, “I’m not sure if it’s a bl essing or a curse.” A “blessing” (blessing) is a noun – comes from the verb “to bles s” (bless) and it means a good thing that is given to you, often for those who are  religious, say that “It is a blessing from God,” or “It is a blessing from Allah .” It is something good that is given to you . The opposite of that would be a “cur se” (curse). The idea is that a “curse” is a punishment, it’s a bad thing. Well, I’ m saying that “Email may be a blessing or a curse,” and that again is a common ex pression. “Is it a blessing or a curse?” – someone would say, or “I don’t know if it ’s a blessing or a curse.” It has good things, it has bad things. I end by saying, “I  suppose it’s both.” Now, you

probably know, we use that verb a lot – “suppose” –  to mean different things. Here, it means “I guess.” “I think it’s both but I’ m not sure, but that’s my best guess.”

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech. > One of the first things I do each morning is to che ck my email. I open the email program on my computer and I check for new messages . It usually takes only a few seconds for my new messages to download from the server into my inbox unless there’s a large attachment. I can then click  onto each new message to read it.
> I reply to messages or forward them to someone else . The important messages I save by putting them into one of my mailboxes. The unimportant ones I just delete.
> I really hate getting spam. Luckily, my email progr am allows me to set up filters so that spam messages are put into a separate mailb ox automatically. I usually scan the messages to make sure real messages weren’ t put into the mailbox by mistake and then I put them in the trash.
> I don’t know what I would do without email, but I’m  constantly checking for new messages. I’m not sure if it’s a blessing or a curs e. I suppose it’s both.

# A Good Review of a Play

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 155: A Good Review of a Play.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 155. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On today’s podcast, we’re going to hear about two p eople going to a play at the theater. Let’s go!

[start of a dialog]

I invited Bruce to a play at the Mark Taper Forum a nd we got there a little early. We handed our tickets to the woman at the door and found our seats.

Megan: I’m glad we got here early to find our seats . I know that this is a sold out performance.

Bruce: The cast is supposed to be really good. I re ad a rave review of the play in the paper last week. The review said that the leads  are perfectly cast and the directing is inspired. Federica saw it a couple  of weeks ago and she said that the staging and the costumes were really something to see.

Megan: I’m really glad. The last time I came to a p lay at this theater, it was a bomb. The two lead actors weren’t up to their par ts and the whole production was amateur. It closed early after only two weeks.

Bruce: That won’t happen with this play. Hey, they’ re dimming the lights. The curtain should be going up any minute

[end of dialog]

In this podcast, we go to or attend a play at a the ater. The story begins with Megan saying that she invited Bruce to a play at the Mark Taper Forum. The Mark Taper Forum is a theater here in Los Angeles. She says that they got there a little early. They arrived there a little early. “We handed our tickets to the woman at the door,” the story says, “and found our seats.” “To hand (hand) something” is to give something to someone by putti ng it in their hand – form your hand to their hand. You can hand a book. You can hand a piece of paper.

You can hand any item that’s small enough to hold. They then found their seats – looked for and found their seats – where they were sitting.

Megan said that she was glad they had arrived early . She knew that this was a “sold out performance.” When we say it’s a “sold ou t” (sold out) – two words – we mean there are no more tickets left. Some people ma y also say, “It’s a sellout” (sellout) – that’s the same as “It has been sold ou t.” “It is sold out.” It’s a sold out “performance.” And that word “performance” (perform ance) is used for a play or any sort of – usually a live entertainment show. It  could be a dance. It could be opera. It could be singing and so forth. In this ca se, it’s a “theater play.” Well, Bruce says that the “cast” of the play is supposed to be really good. The “cast” (cast) are the people who are in the play. The acto rs and actresses are the cast, and that includes everyone who’s on the stage in the play. The “stage,” of course, (stage) is where the play is performed – wh ere the actors are in the theater. A theater has a stage and then it has seat s. Sometimes it has a “balcony” (balcony) – that’s like a second level hi gher up, where people can sit.

Well, Bruce says that he read a “rave review” of the play in the paper last week. A “review” (review) is when someone in the newspape r or on television, gives their opinion of the play. The people who write rev iews are usually called “critics” (critics). A “critic” is someone who writes a revie w of a play or a movie and so forth.

Well, this was a “rave review” that Bruce read. A “ rave (rave) review” means it was a great review, that the reviewer or the critic  was “raving” about the play. “To rave” means to praise, to say very good things abou t a play, to be very excited, enthusiastic. There’s also a noun “rave,” which is very different in a way. A “rave” – as a noun – is a dance – usually a dance that is in some location where you don’t normally have dances – in the desert, for exa mple. And it’s an all night party where people dance throughout the evening. I have never been to a rave before. I guess I’m too old. They became very popul ar in the 1990’s in the United States. People had rave parties. But I was not part  of that, I’m afraid. The “rave review” was in the “paper.” And when we say it was “in the paper,” we mean it was in the newspaper. People will often refer to a newspaper as simply, “the paper.” “Did you read the paper this morning?” – th ey mean did you read the newspaper – probably your local newspaper.

Well, the review in the paper said that the “leads”  were perfectly cast. The “leads” (leads) are the lead or most important actors and a ctresses. Usually, there’s one or two, maybe three, lead actors. These are the one s that you see the most – are most important for the story. We will sometimes jus t call them the “leads.” It’s the same as the “lead actors.” The actors were “perfect ly cast.” Well, we heard that

“cast” (cast) – as a noun – means people who are in  the theater play. But it can also be used as a verb – “to cast.” And “to cast” m eans that we find people for the play to be in the cast. So, we might, for examp le, see that the director is “casting” the play – that means he’s looking for pe ople to be in the play. Usually, they do this by holding auditions. An “audition” (a udition) is when you go to the director and you usually have to act for a few minu tes in front of them. And they can see whether you are good for their play. You al so can cast a movie or a television show. And here in Los Angeles, there are  lots and lots of people who go to what are called “casting calls.” And a “casti ng call” (call) is when they say, “Well, if you want to be in this play, come to this  theater on Monday morning at 8 o’clock,” and then you go and you go to an audition .

Well, getting back to our story. “The leads were pe rfectly cast in this play,” according to Bruce, meaning that the director found  the right people for those particular parts. And a “part” (part) in a play, is  the same thing as a “role” (role). A “part” or a “role” is the person – the character in  the story. For example, in the play “Hamlet” by Shakespeare, one of the roles is “ Hamlet,” another one of the roles is Hamlet’s uncle “Polonius” and so forth. So , the different parts, or different roles are the different characters in the story. Br uce also says that the directing is “inspired.” The directing is what the director does  and the “director” of a play, is the person who tells the actors what to do. He or s he is the boss of the play – the person who is responsible for putting the play on. “To put on a play” means to perform a play. Well, he’s responsible for making s ure all the actors do what they’re supposed to do. And when you say that the d irecting is “inspired” – you mean that it was very good, that he had original ne w ideas.

Bruce also says that his friend, Federica, thought that the “staging and the costumes” were something to see. The “staging” (sta ging) is the way that the stage looks. Remember the stage is where the actors  are. And the “staging,” in part, is what you see up on the stage. And usually,  there’ll be “props” (props). “Props” are anything that the actors and actresses use in the play. The “costumes” (costumes) are, of course, the clothes t hat the actors wear. Bruce says that his friend told him, “The staging and cos tumes were really something to see.” When you say, “Well, that’s something to see, ” we mean it’s really good. It’s something that you will want to see. You could say that about a play. You could also say that about a movie or even a sports game –  “Boy, the Los Angeles Lakers are something to see,” meaning they’re a goo d basketball team and you’ll enjoy them.

Megan says that she’s very glad that the play is go ing to be good because the last time she came to a play at the theater, it was  a “bomb” (bomb). That word “bomb” has many different meanings. As an adjective , in this sentence, it was a

“bomb” – with the indefinite article “a” or “a” – a  “bomb” – that means it was terrible. It was not very good. It was an awful, ho rrible, play. There’s another way of using bomb as an adjective, when we say somethin g is “the bomb” – the bomb – “the bomb” – “the” – we mean it was great. So, it  can be very confusing. The expression “the bomb” is very slang. It’s very popu lar among younger people. So, you won’t see that in the newspaper. When you use a  “bomb,” you know that it was bad, but if someone says it’s “the bomb,” or “d a bomb” – sometimes we pronounce “the” – some people pronounce “the” infor mally as if it were “da.” So, instead of “the bomb,” they say, “da bomb.” But tha t’s very informal – very slang use of that word. A “bomb” as a noun, of course, is  something that explodes – something that you will see in a war, for example, when they drop bombs from the planes. But here as an adjective, it means it w as a bad play. We often use that adjective about plays. Not so much about other  things. We don’t say, “The book was a bomb.” It’s possible but that would not be very common. We would use this for a play, in particular.

Well, Megan says that the two lead actors weren’t u p to their parts. “To be up to their parts” and remember the part is the character  that they are playing in the play. “To be up to something” means that you are ab le to do it. You have the ability – the capacity – the capability to do somet hing. You can use that for lots of different situations. If you say, for example, “My friend John isn’t up to swimming three miles today” – means he’s not ready, he’s not  able to do that, he’s not prepared to do that. Well, in this case, the lead a ctors were not up to their parts – were not good enough for their roles and “The whole  production,” Megan said, “was amateur.” The “production” (production) – the “production” is the actual performance of the play. It’s what you go see – eve rything combined – the music, the acting, the staging, the costumes – all of that  is the production. To say something was “amateur” (amateur) means that it was n’t very good. It wasn’t the opposite of amateur which is “professional.” A “pro fessional” is normally someone who gets paid to do something. An “amateur”  is someone who does not get paid. So, for example, in the United States, if  you play college basketball – if you play basketball for your university, you are an  “amateur.” You are not paid. But if you go and play for a professional team then  you become a “professional” and you are paid. We also use these two words, “pro fessional” and “amateur,” to describe how good something is done. If someone say s, “That website is really amateur” they mean it’s not very good. It was done by someone who doesn’t know what they are doing.

Megan says that this play that she saw – that was t errible – “closed early” after only two weeks. When we say a play “closes,” we mea n that’s the end of the performances at that theater. The opposite would be  “to open.” So, “When is the play going to open?” “When is the play going to clo se?” If a play is really bad, it

may close early. The theater may decide not to keep  performing that play. Bruce says that this play is not going to end early. It’s  not going to close early, I should say.

He says, “Hey! They’re dimming the lights. The curt ain should be going up any minute.” “To dim” (dim) means to lower the light. S o, if someone says we’re going to dim the lights, they mean the lights are going t o go from being very bright to less bright – usually, they turn the lights of comp letely. But they do it slowly and that’s called “dimming.” So, they dim the lights. T he curtain will now go up. The “curtain” (curtain) is what is out the front of the  stage that hides everything behind it. And then they open the curtain or the curtain g oes up – if it’s an older theater – and the play then can begin. Bruce says that “The c urtain should be going up any minute.” When someone says, “Any minute” they mean at any time, very soon – could be five seconds, could be 25 seconds but very , very soon. Someone, for example, may say, “I will be there any minute” – me ans “I’m driving there, and I will arrive very, very soon.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a native rate of speech.

[start of a dialog]

I invited Bruce to a play at the Mark Taper Forum a nd we got there a little early. We handed our tickets to the woman at the door and found our seats.

Megan: I’m glad we got here early to find our seats . I know that this is a sold out performance.

Bruce: The cast is supposed to be really good. I re ad a rave review of the play in the paper last week. The review said that the leads  were perfectly cast and the directing is inspired. Federica saw it a couple  of weeks ago and she said that the staging and the costumes were really something to see.

Megan: I’m really glad. The last time I came to a p lay at this theater, it was a bomb. The two lead actors weren’t up to their par ts and the whole production was amateur. It closed early after only two weeks.

Bruce: That won’t happen with this play. Hey, they’ re dimming the lights. The curtain should be going up any minute

# Rumors and Secrets

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 156: Rumors and Secrets.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 156. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This podcast is going to be about two people, talki ng about one of their fellow workers and talking about rumors that they have hea rd. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Jack: So, what do you think of the new guy?

Kate: Oh, you mean Bernard? He’s okay, I guess. Why ?

Jack: Well, I heard that he left his last company u nder mysterious circumstances. I tried to find out more from Libby, but she was ve ry hush-hush about it.

Kate: I’m not surprised. Libby doesn’t like to goss ip, unlike some people…

Jack: I’m not gossiping. I just like to know more a bout the people I work with.

Kate: Okay, but don’t start any rumors. Bernard see ms nice and I think we should give him a chance.

Jack: Don’t worry. I’ll cut him some slack, but I want to know what skeletons are in his closet.

Kate: Take it from me. You won’t find any dirty lit tle secrets and you may make an enemy of Bernard in the process.

Jack: You’re probably right but I wonder what Natha n knows…

[end of dialog]

On this podcast, we heard a dialog between Jack and  Kate. And they are talking at work about one of their new co-workers, or new f ellow employees. The dialog begins by Jack saying, “So, what do you think of the new guy?” “The new guy”

would be the new person, in this case. And we use t hat expression, sort of as a joke when you have someone new join your company or  your organization. And people will say, “Oh, yeah. He’s the new guy.” He’s  the new person. The old expression for this was “the new kid on the block.”  A “block,” of course, is part of a city where people live. You have streets and in b etween the streets are blocks, where the houses and the buildings are. So, the exp ression “a new kid on the block” means that someone had just moved there and all the other kids – all the other children – would refer to him as “the new kid  on the block.” Well, here it’s a similar idea, except we just say, “The new guy.”

Kate says, “Oh, you mean Bernard?” – that is, you a re talking about Bernard. She says, “He’s okay, I guess. Why?” The use of “I guess” here means I think so. She’s not actually trying to guess what this person  is like. We use that expression to mean, “I think.” But usually, when you’re not qu ite sure, you don’t have a strong opinion.

Jack says that he heard that the new guy left his c ompany “under mysterious circumstances.” In other words, Jack heard a “rumor .” And a “rumor” (rumor) is what someone says about someone else and you’re not  quite sure if it’s true or not. “Rumors” get started frequently about, for exa mple, celebrities, or movie stars. One of the most famous rumors is that Elvis,  the singer Elvis Presley, isn’t really dead – that he’s living somewhere on some sm all island. Well, that’s a rumor – a false rumor, I think. Who knows? But in t his case, the rumor is about how Bernard, the new guy, left his previous company  – his old company, his last company – “under mysterious circumstances.”

“Mysterious” is an adjective. The noun is “mystery.  And when we say something is a “mystery” we mean we don’t know what the answe r is. We don’t understand it. And “mysterious” would be the adjective. “Well,  it’s a mysterious circumstance.” A “circumstance” is a situation – wh at happens – that’s circumstance. We use that word “circumstance” a lot  to say, for example, “Under difficult circumstances,” meaning under a situation  that would be difficult, or “In these circumstances, I would recommend that you fin d another job,” meaning in this situation, I would recommend that.

Well, Bernard left his job under mysterious circums tances, according to Jack – that’s Jack’s opinion – what he heard from someone else. He says that he tried to find out more from Libby, one of his other co-wo rkers, but she was very “Hush- hush” about it. “Hush” (hush) – “hush” (hush) – “to  be hush-hush” means not to talk about it, to be secretive, to not want to tell  anyone else. Someone says, “Oh, he’s very hush-hush about his new girlfriend” means  he doesn’t want to talk about his new girlfriend – that’s to be “hush-hush. ”

 Kate says that she isn’t surprised that Libby, her co-worker, “doesn’t like to gossip, unlike some people.” “To gossip” (gossip) m eans to tell rumors to other people about someone else or to talk about someone else when they aren’t there. This, of course, is a very popular thing tha t we do. We talk about our friends or our family members and the word, in this  case, the verb “to gossip” is a negative – has a negative meaning in English. “To g ossip” is considered a bad thing, but even so, people, of course, do gossip.

We can also use “gossip” as a noun. “I heard some g ossip,” for example, or “Did you hear the gossip about Tom Cruise?” Did you? Wel l, Kate says in our story that “Libby doesn’t like to gossip, unlike some peo ple.” That expression “unlike (unlike) some people” means that she is telling Jac k that he likes to gossip. We use this expression as something of an insult to so meone else. Usually, it’s not serious. What we are saying is that this person is doing something wrong, something that he or she shouldn’t do and you are t elling them that by using this indirect expression. For example, my friend is comp laining about his brother. And I say, “Well, my brother doesn’t like to complain, unlike some people.” And if I say that to him, I mean, “unlike you.” So, we are telli ng someone that they are like that – negative – they have that negative character istic. Kate says that “Libby doesn’t like to gossip, unlike some people,” meanin g “Unlike you, Jack, who likes to gossip.”

Jack says, “I’m not gossiping. I just like to know more about the people I work with.” Kate says that Jack should not start any rum ors. Notice we use the verb “to start” with a rumor. “I’m going to start a rumor” m eans I’m going to make something up, or I’m going to tell other people som ething. I’ll be the first one to tell them.

“Bernard,” Kate says, “seems nice and I think we sh ould give him a chance.” “To give someone a chance” (chance) means to give them an opportunity. There’s a similar expression which is to give someone a “brea k” (break). You give someone a break when they do something wrong and yo u’re not going to yell at them or be angry at them or think badly of them. Yo u say, “Well, give me a break” means – can mean – that you did something wr ong, but now you want to be able to do it correctly. We also use the express ion “Give me a break,” when we don’t believe someone or we think something that  we are being told is wrong. Someone will say, “Did you hear that Elvis is  livi ng in Los Angeles?” and you say, “Give me a break” – means I don’t believe that .

Well, in the dialog, Kate says that she thinks they  should give Bernard a chance. Give him an opportunity. Jack says, “Don’t worry. I ’ll cut him some slack.” “I will

cut (cut) him some slack (slack)” – “to cut someone  some slack” is similar to give someone a break – means that we aren’t going to wor ry about that person doing everything right all the time. We usually use this expression for someone who’s just beginning a job or beginning a project. And yo u are giving them the opportunity to learn and to do better. So, you cut them some slack. The word “slack” (slack) actually is when you have a rope, o r a string, and it’s tight – meaning two people are pulling on it, for example, from different directions. Well, if you stop pulling on it, there’ll be some loose s tring or loose rope. And that’s called “slack,” when the rope isn’t tight. But “to cut someone some slack” means to give them a break, to give them a chance, to giv e them an opportunity. Jack says that he wants to know “what skeletons are  in Bernard’s closet.” A “skeleton” (skeleton) is, of course, the bones in y our body but without the skin, without the blood, without the organs. When you die , for example, you will lose those things, and you will have nothing but a skele ton. Well, you often see a skeleton, for example, as a symbol on Halloween in the United States. And it’s just the bones of a person.

Now, the expression – you want to see what skeleton s are in your closet or are hidden in your closet – the idea is that if you kil l someone and you don’t want anyone to know, you may put their body in a closet and eventually, after time passes, there will be just their skeleton – not a v ery pleasant, nice idea, but it is a common expression. People say, “I think he has some  skeletons in his closet,” meaning something happened in his past that was bad . We often look for skeletons in the closets of politicians. For exampl e, a politician will be running for president – trying to become president or prime min ister in a country – and someone will go back and talk to their old friends and find out if they did anything wrong when they were younger – that’s looking for s keletons in someone’s closet.

Well, Kate says, “Take it from me. You won’t find a ny dirty little secrets.” The first expression “take it from me” means believe me, list en to what I’m saying because I know more than you do. “Take it from me. You do not want to visit Minnesota in December. It’s much too cold.” In othe r words, I know because I have some knowledge or some experience. Kate also s ays that “You won’t find any dirty little secrets.” Well, a “secret,” you kn ow, of course, is something that you are hiding from someone else, something you are  not telling someone else. “Dirty little secrets” is an expression which means  some very bad secrets, some secrets about something negative that happened in t his person’s life.

Kate says that “You may make an enemy of Bernard in  the process.” “To make an enemy of someone” means that you get that other person angry – mad at you and then they will not like you if you do that. So,  “to make enemies” means to do

something that will get other people mad at you. the expression “in the process” – Kate says, “You may make an enemy of Bernard in t he process” – means while you are doing that. And usually, the expression “in  the process” is used when a person doesn’t realize or doesn’t intend for the ot her thing to happen. So, for example, in this dialog, Jack wants to find out wha t skeletons are hidden in Bernard’s closet. But if he tries to do that, Berna rd may become angry with him. That isn’t why Jack is looking for skeletons, he’s not trying to make Bernard angry, but in the process, that will happen – meani ng because he’s doing the other thing – looking for skeletons in his closet –  that may make Bernard unhappy. The dialog ends with Jack saying, “You’re probably right but I wonder what Nathan knows” – means he’s still looking for r umors and secrets and he’s now going to talk to another one of his co-workers,  Nathan.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

Jack: So, what do you think of the new guy?

Kate: Oh, you mean Bernard? He’s okay, I guess. Why ?

Jack: Well, I heard that he left his last company u nder mysterious circumstances. I tried to find out more from Libby, but she was ve ry hush-hush about it.

Kate: I’m not surprised. Libby doesn’t like to goss ip, unlike some people…

Jack: I’m not gossiping. I just like to know more a bout the people I work with.

# Taking the Bus in Los Angeles

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 157: Taking the Bus.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 157. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to take a ride on the bus. Here we go! > I just moved to L.A. and don’t have a car. Everybod y says that you can’t get around this city without one, but I wanted to prove  them wrong.
> I asked my neighbor to take me to the downtown bus station so I could try taking the bus home. She thought I was crazy, but gave me a ride. When I got there, I went inside and got a bus schedule. I looked at the  map and figured out that I needed to take three buses to get home. The fare wa s $1.75 per ride and I could buy a single ticket, a booklet of 20, or a bus pass . I would need transfers, too, to change buses.
> I took my map and went outside to wait at the bus s top for the Number 8 bus. Soon, it pulled up and I got on. I gave my ticket t o the bus driver and took a seat. At the stop where I needed to get off, I rang the b ell, the bus stopped, and I got off. I waited for the next bus. I waited and waited . A man who was also waiting for the Number 14 bus said that it wasn’t unusual for t he bus to be delayed. It finally got there and I found out that the bus had broken d own along the route and they had to get another bus to take its place. By this t ime, I was getting pretty tired. Maybe getting a car in L.A. wasn’t such a bad idea.

We’re taking the bus in this podcast. I have to say  that this is definitely a fictional story – a made up story, one that is not true – bec ause I have lived in Los Angeles for about 15 years and I have never taken a  bus here in Los Angeles. I used to take a bus all the time when I lived back i n Minnesota, but the public bus system in Los Angeles – the public transportation s ystem is very poor compared to most big cities in the world. It is not a very c onvenient way to move from one part of the city to another, to get from one part of the city to another. So, I had to

make this story up. Actually, Dr. Tse had to make t his story up, but it is the same pretty much in any American city, the way the bus s ystem works.

Well, our story begins by me saying that “Everybody  says that you can’t get around in this city – in Los Angeles – without a ca r. But I wanted to prove them wrong.” Everybody says you can’t get around. “To ge t around” – two words – means to be able to go from one place to another – not a specific place. For example, you wouldn’t say, “I need to get around fr om my house to the beach.” When you use the verb “to get around,” you mean in general, getting from one place to another within the city. “How do you get a round?” “I have a car,” or “I take the bus.” I said that I wanted to “prove other  people wrong” about not owning a car in Los Angeles – not having a car in L os Angeles. “To prove someone wrong,” of course, means to show them that they are wrong – to give them evidence that they are wrong. You can prove so meone wrong. You can prove someone right. But usually, you try to prove people wrong – that’s just the way we are as humans, I guess.

Well, I asked my neighbor to take me to the downtow n bus station. And “bus station” – two words – is the main place where the buses are located. Usually, it’s near a downtown area. But most people don’t go to t he bus station to get a bus because, of course, the buses go around the city. You can pick them up anywhere in the city. But the buses all begin, usua lly, from a bus station. Of course, you can have a bus station. You can have a train station. We sometimes call these stations – these places – “terminals” (t erminal). A “terminal” is where something ends, but when we talk about a bus termin al, or a train terminal, those are usually for buses and trains that are going to other cities – to other places.

So, I’m at the downtown bus station in our story. M y neighbor “gave me a ride” to the bus station. And, of course, “to give someone a  ride (ride)” means that you drive them there. They go with you in your car. Whe n I got to the bus station, I went inside and got a “bus schedule.” And, of cours e, the bus schedule is a list of all the times and places where the buses travel to.  “I looked at the map and I found out I needed to take three buses from downtow n to my house.” There wasn’t one bus that went directly near my house. So , I had to take three of these.

 Well, the “fare” (fare) for the bus ride was $1.75 , one dollar, seventy five cents. And, of course, the “fare” is the amount of money t hat you have to pay. We use the word “fare” for buses. We use it for airplanes.  “How much is the airfare?” “How much is the bus fare?” “How much is the train fare?” – anything that has to do with transportation. We even say, “How much is t he cab, or taxi cab, fare?” It’s the price that you pay. Well, you can buy a single ticket, which means it’s only one ride. You can buy a booklet of twenty tickets. A “booklet” (booklet) is a small

book, but it’s not a book that you read. A “booklet ,” in this case, is just a collection of tickets that you can use for the bus.  We can use booklet as something you do read. A small book could be called  a booklet. Usually, we use the term “booklet” for things that are informationa l. So, if you go to the doctor and you have a certain problem, he may give you a bookl et to read with information about it. But here, “booklet” is just a collection of tickets. Another thing that you can get to ride a bus is a “pass” (pass). A “pass” – you pay usually, a certain amount of money for a week or a month. And you can use the bus as much as you want during that time. There are bus passes, th ere are train passes, but I don’t think there are any airline or airplane passe s.

One of the things you have to do sometimes, and I h ave to do in this story, is to “change buses.” And usually, they will give you – w hen you get on the bus – what’s called a “transfer.” A “transfer” (transfer)  is a little – it’s like a ticket that says you already paid for this ride. So, you don’t have to pay again when you get on another bus going in the same direction. So, we call these “transfers.” If you want to change buses or go to another bus, you need  a transfer. The way things work in buses is that when you first get on the bus , you have to pay. You put money in a machine or you give the driver, the bus driver, a ticket, or you show the bus driver your pass. You can’t get on the bus without paying.

In most American buses, you can only get on the bus  in the front of the bus. There’s usually two doors, one in the front and one  in the middle for you to get out of the bus. But you can only get on, on the fro nt door. Well, I said I took my map and I went outside to wait at a “bus stop.” A “ bus stop – two words – (bus stop) – is a place, obviously, where the bus stops.  There are bus stops that are marked (marked). “To be marked” means there’s a sig n that says, “This is a bus stop.” And often, in many cities, there will be a p lace for you to sit by the bus stop. We usually call that a “bench” (bench). Somet imes, there’s a little shelter and a “bus shelter” is a small – it’s like a small,  little house but it’s not a house. It’s a place where you can stand in case it is rain ing to keep dry. So, there’s a little roof with usually, some side walls. But it’s  not a big thing. It’s maybe, 5 or 6 people could stand underneath the bus shelter. Thes e are more popular in northern cities like Minneapolis, St. Paul – where I’m from – Chicago, New York – those places probably will have bus shelters more t han here in Los Angeles because, of course, it’s always sunny here in Los A ngeles; that’s why it’s so beautiful. That’s not true, of course. It’s raining  right now, outside, as I record the podcast. But normally, it’s sunny.

Well, I am waiting for the number 8 bus. And buses usually have numbers as they do in most countries. And we say “the number 8  bus.” We would not say, “I’m waiting for number 8 bus.” We would use the in definite article “the.”

Sometimes, people will say, “I’m waiting for the 8 bus.” They won’t even say the word number, but the 8 bus, or the number 8 bus.

Well, the bus “pulled up” and I got on. When we say  a bus “pulled up” we mean that it drove to where I was standing and stopped. So, the bus pulled up. A car can pull up, meaning you’re standing somewhere and a car comes and parks right near you. We would say, the car “pulled up” t o you. “The bus pulled up and I got on,” meaning I entered the bus. I gave my ticke t to the bus driver. I took a seat. And at the stop where I needed to “get off,” meaning at the place where I needed to get off the bus, I rang the bell. And in many American buses, there’s a button or a cord – a string that you pull so that t he bell rings and the driver knows that you want to get off at the next stop. Of cours e, it’s important to ring the bell before you get to the stop.

Well, I got off and I waited for the next bus and I  waited a very long time. And someone told me that “it wasn’t unusual” for the bu s to be delayed. “It wasn’t unusual” means it’s usual. Of course, when you have  two negative ideas in a sentence in English, it’s a positive – the idea is a positive one. So, if we say “it wasn’t unusual,” we mean it is usual, it is common.  “It wasn’t unusual for the bus to be delayed.” “To be delayed” (delayed) means to be late – not to be there on time. It’s delayed. If you go to the airport and yo u look up at the television screen – the computer monitor that has the airplane inform ation – if it says “delayed” next to the place where you’re going – next to your  airplane – that means that it’s not going to leave on time – that’s maybe the worst  thing you want to see in an airport, is that your flight has been delayed, your  plane has been delayed.

Well, here in the story, the bus was delayed. The b us had “broken down.” When we say an automobile or a bus, or any sort of machi ne “breaks down,” we mean it stops working. This bus broke down along the rou te. The “route” (route) – which some people pronounce “route” – the “route” i s the places where the bus travels. A “route” is like a path. It is a place wh ere something goes, travels across. In this case, the route could be up Sunset Boulevard and then down La Brea Avenue and then across Wilshire Avenue to Sant a Monica – that would be the route. You can talk about a “route,” also for a  parade. Someone says, “Where is the parade route?” We just had a marathon race h ere in Los Angeles a couple of weeks ago, the Los Angeles marathon, and there w as a marathon route. So, they block the streets so that the runners can run.  Not me, but, you know, people who run. “Runners,” I guess, we would call them. So , in this case, the bus broke down and the company had to get another bus to take  its place – that is, another bus that would pick up the riders or the passengers  for the bus that broke down.

I should also mention that most buses are operated by the government, the local government. So, the city has a company that runs the buses. Well, I was getting pretty tired and at the end of the story, I conclud ed – I came to the conclusion – that L.A really requires a car – that “getting a ca r wasn’t such a bad idea.” Once again you see two negatives here. “Bad” is negative  and “was not” is negative. So, someone says, “It wasn’t such a bad idea,” what  they’re saying is it’s a good idea. So, you’ll often hear, even though you don’t normally put two negatives in a sentence – there are some common expressions where we use two negative words such as this case, it wasn’t such a bad idea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech. > I just moved to L.A. and don’t have a car. Everybod y says that you can’t get around this city without one, but I wanted to prove  them wrong.
> I asked my neighbor to take me to the downtown bus station so I could try taking the bus home. She thought I was crazy, but gave me a ride. When I got there, I went inside and got a bus schedule. I looked at the  map and figured out that I needed to take three buses to get home. The fare wa s $1.75 per ride and I could buy a single ticket, a booklet of 20, or a bus pass . I would need transfers, too, to change buses.
> I took my map and went outside to wait at the bus s top for the Number 8 bus. Soon, it pulled up and I got on. I gave my ticket t o the bus driver and took a seat. At the stop where I needed to get off, I rang the b ell, the bus stopped, and I got off. I waited for the next bus. I waited and waited . A man who was also waiting for the Number 14 bus said that it wasn’t unusual for t he bus to be delayed. It finally got there and I found out that the bus had broken d own along the route and they had to get another bus to take its place. By this t ime, I was getting pretty tired. Maybe getting a car in L.A. wasn’t such a bad idea.

# Shopping with My Wife

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 158: Shopping with My Wife.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  158. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, located in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s podcast is going to be a story about me going shopping with my wife. Let’s go! > One thing I dread more than anything else is going clothes shopping with my wife. It’s not that I don’t like helping her buy ne w clothes. It’s just that I have no fashion sense.
> My wife always asks me, “What do you think of this one?” and I always answer with something like: “That’s nice” or “That looks g ood on you.” That usually satisfies her, but sometimes I get harder questions  like, “Which one looks better, this one or the other one?” It’s a hard question to  answer because whichever one I pick, she will follow up with the question I drea d the most: “Why?”
> The truth is, I don’t know why. I don’t know if it’ s because of the color, the cut, the hemline, or the fit. I might have an idea, but I ca n’t put it into words.
> One question I do know the answer to, though, is: “ Do I look fat in this?” The answer to THAT question is always, always, “No!”

In this podcast, you are going with me as we shop f or clothes with my wife. I begin the story by saying that “One thing I dread m ore than anything else is going clothes shopping.” “To dread” (dread) is when  you are not looking forward to something. When you really dislike something, yo u don’t want to do something, but you probably have to do it. For exam ple, “I dread going to work on Monday morning,” means I really don’t want to go  to work, but I know I have to, in this case. Well, I dread more than anything else going clothes shopping – going out to buy clothing with my wife. “It’s not t hat I don’t like helping her buy new clothes. It’s just that I have no fashion sense .” Couple of things about that –

those sentences – “it’s not that, It’s just that” –  that construction, that use of those expressions is very common in English. “It’s not th at” means this – what I’m going to say is not true, “It’s just that” – now I’ m going to say something that is true.

So, for example, in the story, I say, “It’s not tha t I don’t like helping her buy clothes” – that means I do like helping her buy clo thes. That isn’t the problem, however. The problem is and then I say, “It’s just that I have no fashion sense.” “It’s just that” is followed by the real reason or the real problem. So, someone may say to you, in a different situation, “It’s not  that Minnesota is very cold in the winter. It’s just that I prefer to spend my time in  Hawaii.” So, you are saying, “Well, the problem with Minnesota isn’t the cold. T he problem is that I prefer to go to Hawaii” – that’s a similar use of that construct ion – “It’s not that. It’s just that.”

Well, in this case, the problem is that I have no “ fashion sense.” “Fashion” (fashion) and “sense” (sense). Well, you know fashi on means the way or the kind of clothing that people wear. We say something is “ in fashion” – that means it’s popular. Many people are dressing that way. A “fash ion sense” is a consciousness, an ability to know what looks good, and what doesn’t look good. So, someone with a fashion sense can say, “Oh. That  color is a good color to wear with this other color.” But someone like me, w ith no fashion sense, could put on green and purple and think, “Oh. That looks okay.” So, I have no fashion sense. And that’s what we mean by “fashion sense” –  someone who knows, the knowledge of knowing which clothes to wear.

My wife always asks me, “What do you think of this one?” And I always answer, “That’s nice,” meaning “Yeah, that’s okay,” or “Tha t looks good on you.” And, of course, “to look good on someone” means that the cl othes look good on them – the clothes are attractive - that the person has a nice look about them in those clothes.

I say in the story that when I tell my wife “That’s  nice,” or “That looks good on you,” “That usually satisfies her.” “To satisfy her ” means she doesn’t ask more questions. She thinks, “Oh. Okay. I accept that.” S he is satisfied. The noun there would be “satisfaction.” Well, my responses usually  satisfy her, but sometimes, I say, “I get harder questions.” Of course, a “hard ( hard) question” is a difficult question. So, I get more difficult – or harder – qu estions when she asks, “Which one looks better, A or B?” And I say, “That’s a har d question because whichever one I pick,” meaning whichever dress, in this case,  I select – A or B – “whichever” one could be either one. Another way of saying “whi chever” is “it doesn’t matter which one I choose.”

For either choice, she will follow up with a questi on I dread the most. “To follow up” – two words – (follow up) – “to follow up” mean s to do something after someone else has done something – that you want mor e information, for example. You can follow up with a question. Sometim es, we use that verb by itself. “I’m going to follow up on our meeting toda y” means I’m going to call you again or email you again about what we talked about  in our meeting. Well, in this case, my wife “follows up with a question” – means after I answer her question, she asks me another question. And the question that  I dread the most – remember “dread” means I hate, I dislike – the most  – is “Why?”

Well, I say in the story that “The truth is, I don’ t know why.” “The truth is” is an expression we use when we are trying to be very hon est with someone else, maybe telling them something that we wouldn’t norma lly tell them. So, for example, my wife says, “Do you want to go over to m y sister’s house?” And I say, “Well, the truth is, I’m really tired.” I’m telling  her something I may not say otherwise, or I can say, “The truth is, I don’t lik e your sister’s dog,” or whatever the reason is. In this case, the real reason I can’ t answer my wife’s question is I don’t know the answer. I don’t know why I like some thing.

I say that “It could be because of the color of the  dress,” for example, the “cut” (cut) of the dress. The “cut” is how it is formed –  what shape it is – that would be the cut of a piece of clothing. When you buy jeans,  for example, blue jeans, you can get them in a “boot” cut (boot). A “boot cut” –  “boot,” of course, is a kind of shoe and a “boot cut” means that the pants fit very  straight on your leg. They’re cut very straight. You could also get a wide-cut, o r a loose cut – whatever kind of cut it is, it’s the shape of the clothing. The “hem line” (hemline) – all one word – is the bottom of the dress, in this case. It’s where t he dress ends – that would be the “hemline.” So, when people talk about dresses a nd skirts that women wear, they may talk about how the hemline has been going up – means the skirts have been getting shorter. The “hemline” is the bottom w here the skirt or where the dress ends.

I say that “I don’t know if it’s because of the cut , the hemline, or the fit” (fit). The “fit” means how well something looks on you – if it ’s tight. Is it too loose? Is it too tight? – these are always talking about the fit. If  it’s just perfect, we say, “That’s a perfect fit.” It’s not too tight, not too loose.

Well, I end my story by saying that there is one qu estion that I always know the answer to. And it is always the same answer. If my wife says, “Do I look fat in this?” meaning does this piece of clothing make me look like I am fat? the answer to that - and if you are a man, you know the answer  to this question. It is always “No.” – doesn’t matter what the dress is; it’s alwa ys “No.” If you don’t know the

answer to that question then you’re probably not ma rried or don’t have a girlfriend.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of story]

One thing I dread more than anything else is going clothes shopping with my wife. It’s not that I don’t like helping her buy ne w clothes. It’s just that I have no fashion sense.

My wife always asks me, “What do you think of this one?” and I always answer with something like: “That’s nice” or “That looks g ood on you.” That usually satisfies her but sometimes I get harder questions like, “Which one looks better, this one or the other one?” It’s a hard question to  answer because whichever one I pick, she will follow up with the question I drea d the most: “Why?”

The truth is, I don’t know why. I don’t know if it’ s because of the color, the cut, the hemline, or the fit. I might have an idea, but I ca n’t put it into words.

One question I do know the answer to, though, is: “ Do I look fat in this?” The answer to THAT question is always, always, “No!”

# Moonlighting

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 159: Moonlighting.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 159. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this podcast, we’re going to hear about someone who works two jobs – someone who moonlights. Let’s get started!

[start of dialog]

Robert: You look exhausted. You must have been out late last night having fun.

Muriel: I wish. I’ve actually started moonlighting.  I’ve decided to go back to school and need the extra money to make ends meet.

Robert: Good for you. That’s great. Where are you m oonlighting?

Muriel: I’m working at the university library. At t hat time of night, it’s pretty dead. When there are no students around, I can use the ti me to study. It works out pretty well, except for the hours.

Robert: Oh, yeah? What are they?

Muriel: My work schedule is pretty good, actually. I work three days a week: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. But my hours are 7 t o midnight. By the time I get home, I’m dead tired.

Robert: No wonder you look beat. Here, have some mo re coffee.

Muriel: Thanks. I just hope I don’t fall asleep in the morning meeting.

Robert: It’s okay. No one will notice.

Muriel: Thanks a lot!

Robert: Don’t mention it.

[end of dialog]

 The title of today’s podcast is “Moonlighting,” and  “to moonlight” (moonlight) – all one word – means to work a second job, usually at n ight, in addition to your regular job. So, you have two jobs, or perhaps thre e jobs. “Moonlight,” of course is what comes from the moon up in the sky which you  can see at night, and because people usually work their second job, if th ey have a second job, at night, they work “by the moonlight,” meaning that they can  see the moon when you’re working – I guess – if you’re working outdoors. But  “moonlighting,” just means, in general, to work another job, a second job. My fath er, for example, worked two jobs. He moonlighted. During the day, he worked as a teacher and at night he worked at the post office because he had such a big  family and lots of people to feed – to give food to.

Anyway, in this particular dialog, Robert and Murie l are talking and Robert says, “You look exhausted.” “To look exhausted” or “to be  exhausted” – and “exhausted” is (exhausted) – “to look exhausted” me ans to look very tired, to look very, very tired. The verb “to exhaust” actually ha s two meanings. If we talk about a person, we say, for example, “This person exhaust s me” – means they make me very tired. If you use the verb “exhaust” with a  thing, for example, “I have exhausted my money,” or “I have exhausted my time,”  that means that I have used it all up – that I have used it and I don’t ha ve any more left. Well, in this case, Robert says, “You look exhausted” – you look very tired. “You must have been out late last night having fun.” “You must hav e been” – means you probably were. I think that you were, in this case. “To be o ut late” means, in general, to have gone somewhere – to a movie, to dinner, perhap s dancing. “To be up late” means you did not get home until very late at night . “I was out late last night” usually means I was out with friends having a good time.

Well, Muriel says, “I wish.” This is a pretty commo n expression, informally. When someone says, “Oh, I wish” with that sort of accent , that sort of intonation, they mean that they did not, in fact, do what you said t hey did. But they wish that they had. Usually, it’s something positive that they wis h they had done. So, in this case, when Robert says, “You must have been out lat e last night having fun,” Muriel says, “I wish,” meaning I wish I had been. I t’s a use of the conditional. But instead of saying, “I wish I had been out having fu n,” she says just, “I wish.” Well, she says that in fact, she has started moonlighting  because she is going back to school – probably back to college, back to the univ ersity. And she needs the extra money “to make ends meet.” “To make ends (end s) meet (meet)” – two words – “to make ends meet” means to get money to p ay for your basic living expenses – your food, your rent, your transportatio n, your car. “To make ends meet” means to have enough money to live at a very simple level. Robert says, “Good for you.” That again, is a common expression that we use, in this case,

when a person is complimenting you, is saying a nic e thing about you – usually something that you are trying to do to improve your self or to do something good for someone or for yourself. So, the expression her e, “Well, good for you” means that’s great. I think that’s wonderful. Usually, we  use that among friends.

Well, Robert says, “Why” – or rather, “Where are yo u moonlighting?” And Muriel says, “I’m working at the university library” – the  college library. “At that time of night, it’s pretty dead.” “At that time of night” m eans when she has to work – later at night – it’s pretty dead. When we say something is “dead” (dead) we mean there is not much going on. There are very few peop le there. So, if you go to a store, and you say, “Wow. It’s really dead here.” W e mean there’s no one here. And in this case, Muriel is saying that there aren’ t very many people at the library. It’s pretty dead. “When there are no stude nts around,” she says, “I can use the time to study.” “When there are no students  around (around)” means when there are no students present – when there are  no students there. You, again, can use this expression in lots of ways. “I went to my brother’s house, but there was no one around” – means there was no one t here – no one present. Muriel says that “It works out pretty well, except for the hours” – that is, her job works out pretty well. For something to “work out” means that it is going well, it has a good result. It is something that is positive . “Is this going to work out?” means is this going to function. Is this going to h ave a good result? She says, “It works out pretty well,” and again, of course, we us e “pretty” (pretty) to mean very. So when Muriel says, “It’s pretty dead” she means i t’s very dead. “It works out pretty well” means it works out very well, except f or the hours. “Except for” here means everything is good but this thing is not – in  this case, the hours. And when she says, “The hours” she means the hours she has t o work.

Robert asks her, “Oh, yeah? What are they?” meaning  what hours do you work. And she says, “My work schedule is pretty good. I w ork three days a week – Monday, Wednesday and Friday – but my hours are 7 t o midnight.” 7 P.M at night to midnight – those are the hours she has to work – “my hours,” she says. By the time she gets home, she says she is “dead ti red.” Here, the word “dead” means something a little bit different. When we say  we are “dead tired.” We mean that we are very tired. We are exhausted. Some one says, “Oh, I’m dead tired” – they mean they’re very tired. Robert says,  “No wonder you look beat.” “No wonder” means here that it is no surprise that you look that way. And again, that’s a common use of that expression. “No wonder you’re such an idiot. Your parents are idiots.” Well, that’s not a very nice t hing to say. “No wonder” means it is no surprise, it is clear. Usually, we use that e xpression when we are going to give the reason why something is happening. For exa mple, someone comes in and they are very wet – their clothes are wet, thei r hair is wet and you may say,

“No wonder you are wet. It’s raining outside.” So, it’s no surprise that you are wet.

Well, Robert says here, “No wonder you look beat.” “To look beat” (beat) is the same as “to look exhausted” – someone who is very, very tired. You may say, “Oh, I am beat” – means I’m very exhausted. Now, as  a verb, “to beat” means something different. It does not mean the same as “ to exhaust.” When you say “I’m going to beat something,” it has couple of mea nings. It can mean I’m going to win over someone else. The Los Angeles Lakers be at the New York Knicks. The Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Minnesota Twins – the sports teams defeat someone else – that can mean “to beat.” “To beat” can also mean to hit. “The man beat his horse because it didn’t ride fast enou gh.” I don’t know. That is a use of “to beat,” but here, as an adjective it means “v ery tired.”

Muriel says that she hopes she does not fall asleep  in the morning meeting. And Robert says, “It’s okay. No one will notice.” “To n otice” (notice) means no one will realize. No one will know what is happening. Of cou rse, Robert is joking when he says no one will notice because what that means is that Muriel is obviously not very important and he’s kidding, he’s joking. And t hat’s why Muriel says, “Thanks a lot!” meaning you’ve insulted me, but she knows i t is a joke. And Robert says, “Don’t mention it.” When someone thanks you, you ca n say, “You’re welcome.” But you can also say, “Don’t mention it.” “Mention”  is (mention) – “Don’t mention it.” You use that expression especially when you do  someone a favor. You help someone with something and they thank you and you s ay, “Ah, don’t mention it. It was nothing.” You can also say, “No problem.” Th at’s another way people respond to thank you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

Robert: You look exhausted. You must have been out late last night having fun.

Muriel: I wish. I’ve actually started moonlighting.  I’ve decided to go back to school and need the extra money to make ends meet.

Robert: Good for you. That’s great. Where are you m oonlighting?

Muriel: I’m working at the university library. At t hat time of night, it’s pretty dead. When there are no students around, I can use the ti me to study. It works out pretty well, except for the hours.

Robert: Oh, yeah? What are they?

Muriel: My work schedule is pretty good, actually. I work three days a week: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. But my hours are 7 t o midnight. By the time I get home, I’m dead tired.

Robert: No wonder you look beat. Here, have some mo re coffee.

# A Flirt

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 160: Flirting.

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Po dcast episode 160. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Ce nter for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On today’s podcast, we’re going to do a little flir ting. When a boy and a girl are interested in each other, the girl will often flirt . Let’s find out more!

[start of dialog]

Elaine: You look happy.

Jerry: Me? Oh, I was just talking to Ling.

Elaine: Oh, no wonder! You better watch out. She’s a big flirt.

Jerry: What do you mean?

Elaine: Did she make eyes at you and whisper sweet nothings in your ear?

Jerry: Well, yes, she said she’d never met anybody like me before, and by her body language, I think she was serious.

Elaine: Then she’s still using the same old line th at she used with Kramer. She had him wrapped around her little finger.

Jerry: Give me a little credit. I know when I’m bei ng snowed and when a girl is really interested in me.

Elaine: I hope you’re right, but she’s quite the he artbreaker. I just don’t want you to get hurt.

Jerry: Thanks, but I think I can take care of mysel f.

Elaine: Okay. Suit yourself.

[end of dialog]

 The title of today’s podcast is “Flirting.” “To fli rt” (flirt) is when a man or a woman – or a boy or a girl – try to indicate to someone t hat they are romantically interested in – that they are romantically interest ed in them – to get their attention. If you like someone, and you want that p erson to be your boyfriend or girlfriend, or you want to get to know that person better in a romantic way, then it is very common for people to flirt. So, if we say a  girl is “flirting” with a boy, we mean she is sending him messages, signals, if you w ill, that she is interested in him. And, of course, women do this in many differen t ways. Men do as well. Women may, for example, smile or they may play with  their hair and brush their hair back – these are all, sometimes, even unconsci ous – you’re not even aware that you’re doing it. Well, in this case, we had a dialog between Elaine and Jerry. And Elaine says, “You look happy.” And Jerry says, “Me?” Notice, of course, that we don’t say “I,” even though grammatically that wo uld be more correct. But no one does that, no one says – in this case, “I?” The y would almost always say, “Me?” “Me? Oh. I was just talking to Ling,” meaning  I was talking to her a few minutes ago. I was just talking. Notice “just” can have two different meanings. When you say, “I’m just talking to” – “I was just t alking to Ling,” you mean I was talking to her a few minutes ago. You can also use “just” to mean I’m only. “I am just talking to Ling” means I’m only talking to Lin g. I’m not doing anything else.

Well, in this case, Elaine responds by saying, “Oh,  no wonder. You better watch out.” Here, “No wonder” means it’s no surprise, obv iously. “Oh, no wonder. You better watch out.” “To watch out” (watch out) – two  words – means here to be careful. “You better be careful.” “You better make sure that you are aware of what is going on.” If someone says to you, “Watch o ut!” they mean be careful. We often use that expression, for example, if you a re outside at a baseball game and somebody hits a baseball and it is coming in yo ur direction, they may scream “Watch out!” – means be careful, cover your head. O therwise, you may get hit by a baseball. I think that’s what happened to me when  I was younger. I got hit by a baseball in the head and that’s why I’m so strange today – maybe.

Anyway, in this case, Elaine says, “You better watc h out” – that Ling is a “big flirt.” Notice “flirt” here is a noun. It’s a verb – “to flirt” – but it can also be a noun and a “flirt” – when we say a girl is a “flirt” or a woman is a “flirt – or a man is a “flirt’’ – we mean that he or she likes to flirt wi th men or flirt with women, but it’s considered of a negative term when you use it as a noun. You say, “Oh. She’s a flirt,” means she likes to flirt with men even if s he’s not very interested in them. And that’s why Elaine says, “You better watch out. You better be careful.” She may not actually be interested in you. And Jerry sa ys, “What do you mean?” And Elaine says, “Did she make eyes at you?” “To make ( make) eyes (eyes) at someone” – that’s the expression – “To make eyes at ” means, especially for a

woman, that you look at a man as though you are int erested in him romantically. So, well, I cannot demonstrate on the podcast here what that would look like, but you probably know. When someone makes eyes at you, they’re showing that they are interested in you.

Elaine also says, “Did she whisper sweet nothings i n your ear?” This is actually an old expression and Elaine is using it as a joke.  “To whisper” (whisper) means to talk like that, not very loud – to talk very sof tly, not very loudly. “To whisper sweet nothings” – “sweet” (sweet) and “nothings” – plural – is to say things that are nice. “Oh, you’re so attractive.” “I would love  to get to know you better.” “You are the apple of my eye.” “You are the sunshine in life” – these would all – these would all be sweet nothings. And “to whisper sweet nothings in someone’s ear” – notice we say “whisper them in your ear” – means to  say nice things to you. Now, Elaine is joking here because this term – this expr ession – “to whisper sweet nothings in your ear” is a very old one and no one would say that very seriously. They use it sort of as a joke.

Well, Jerry says, “Yes. She said she’d never met an yone like me before.” In other words, Ling told Jerry that she had not met anyone like him before. Jerry says, “By her body language, I think she was serious.” “B ody language” – two words – means what you do with your body – your arms, your  eyes, your legs – things that you do to show someone that you’re interested in.  And, of course, many people think that body language is a better indicat ion than what someone says to you about how they are thinking or feeling.

Elaine responds by saying, “Then she’s still using the same old line that she used with Kramer.” A “line” (line) here means something that you say to someone else to show that you are interested in them romanticall y. But a “line,” in this case, the old line – means the line she has been using for ma ny years with different men – a line is always a negative expression here. It mea ns that the person isn’t sincere, that they’re not being honest. A man comes  up to a woman and says, “Hello beautiful” – that’s a line and by definition , it means he’s not really being sincere. He’s not necessarily really in love with t his woman. He’s just trying to get to know her better. And so, a line is something tha t a man or woman says to another man or a woman to show that they are intere sted, but it usually means it’s not sincere. “To be sincere,” of course, (sinc ere) means, to be honest – to be true to that person.

Elaine says that Ling had Kramer “wrapped around he r finger.” “She had him wrapped around her finger.” “To be wrapped (wrapped ) around your finger” means that she controlled him, that he was so in lo ve with her or liked her so much that she could tell him to do whatever she wan ted to. There was a song by

The Police – the British rock band, The Police – ba ck in the 70’s or 80’s that was called “I’ll be wrapped around your finger.”

I’ll be wrapped around your finger

Now you know why I am not a professional singer. We ll, anyway, “to be wrapped around your finger” means to be controlled by someo ne and it’s usually a woman controlling a man or a man controlling a woman – having power over them. Because they are so – the other person is so attrac ted to them, so in love with them. Well, Jerry says to Elaine, “Give me a little  credit.” “Give me a little credit” – this means don’t think that I am so stupid as to no t recognize this. “Give me a little credit” means you should not think that I am  so dumb, not think that I am so stupid, or not think that I don’t know what I am do ing. “To give someone credit” can also mean to recognize that they did something.  “I give her credit for giving money to the poor.” “I give her credit” means I ack nowledge – I recognize what she has done. Here, when someone says, “Give me a l ittle credit,” or “give me some credit” means don’t think that I am so stupid.  I am smarter than you are assuming that I am.

He says – Jerry says, “I know when I’m being snowed  and when a girl is really interested in me. “To snow someone,” (snow), as a v erb, means to deceive someone, to lie to someone. The verb “to snow,” of course, also means that there is snow that falls from the sky – it is snowi ng outside. But here, when we use it as a verb, in talking about someone – “I am going to snow him,” or “She is trying to snow me” – we mean that they are trying t o lie or deceive or be dishonest with you. So, Jerry says, “I know when I’ m being snowed.” “I know when I’m being fooled” is another way of saying tha t. He says, “I know when a girl is really interested in me.” And, of course, t o be interested in means that she likes him.

Elaine says, “I hope you’re right. But she’s quite the heartbreaker.” A couple of expressions here that are common – “heartbreaker” –  (heartbreaker) is someone who many, for example - a beautiful woman that many  men are attracted to. But the woman isn’t very serious with any of the men an d she may be the boyfriend or rather the girlfriend of someone and then she’ll  leave him and go to another man and be his girlfriend. She’s a heartbreaker mea ns that she breaks your heart. And, of course, “to break someone’s heart” m eans you hurt them emotionally. When you are in love with someone and the other person is not in love with you, that can break your heart. Well, a “ heartbreaker” is someone who breaks someone else’s heart.

The other interesting expression here is “quite the ” – “She’s quite the heartbreaker” – that use of “quite the” is pretty c ommon. “He’s quite the athlete.” “He’s quite the podcaster.” “He’s quite the driver. ” “Quite the” here means that that person is one of the better ones – someone who  is very good at that particular job or task. “He’s quite the pilot” mean s he’s a very good pilot. “He’s quite the web designer” means that he’s a very good  web designer. So, “quite the” is an idiomatic use. Jerry says, “Thanks. But I think I can take care of myself.” And, of course “to take care of yourself” means that you don’t need anyone else’s help. Elaine says, “Okay. Suit yourse lf.” “Suit (suit) yourself.” When you say to someone, “suit yourself,” you mean okay,  I’m not going to help you. You are on your own. Usually we say that when someo ne disagrees with us. For example, you offer somebody help, and they refuse. They say, “No. I don’t want your help.” If you say, “Suit yourself” – it’s a ne gative expression. It means, “Okay, well I tried to help you, but you did not wa nt my help. Suit yourself.” So, there’s a negative meaning there when someone says that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.

[start of dialog]

Elaine: You look happy.

Jerry: Me? Oh, I was just talking to Ling.

Elaine: Oh, no wonder! You better watch out. She’s a big flirt.

Jerry: What do you mean?

Elaine: Did she make eyes at you and whisper sweet nothings in your ear?

Jerry: Well, yes, she said she’d never met anybody like me before, and by her body language, I think she was serious.

Elaine: Then she’s still using the same old line th at she used with Kramer. She had him wrapped around her little finger.

Jerry: Give me a little credit. I know when I’m bei ng snowed and when a girl is really interested in me.

Elaine: I hope you’re right, but she’s quite the he artbreaker. I just don’t want you to get hurt.

 Jerry: Thanks, but I think I can take care of mysel f.

Elaine: Okay. Suit yourself.

# A Bad Boss

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 161, “A Bad Boss.”

You are listening to English as a Second Language P odcast Episode 161. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from t he Center for Educational Development in the beautiful city of Los Angeles in  the state of California.

Today’s podcast is called “A Bad Boss.” Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Tom: I wonder how much longer we’ll have to put up with Dennis. He is the most incompetent boss I’ve ever worked for.

Katie: He’s not that bad, is he? I don’t have much contact with him.

Tom: Are you kidding? He’s always sleeping on the j ob. The other day, he was supposed to keep an eye on the supervisors visiting  from Salt Lake City. Instead, I heard that he went to a baseball game and the sup ervisors ended up stranded at the downtown office.

Katie: It’s hard to believe that he’d fall down on the job like that.

Tom: It’s not only that. He’s always passing the bu ck. Every time something goes wrong at the factory, he blames everyone but himsel f.

Katie: If he’s as bad as you say he is, he must be on his way out. But, you know what they say, “Better the devil you know, than the  devil you don’t.”

Tom: Yeah, I know, but I’m willing to take my chanc es.

[end of dialogue]

The title of today’s podcast is “A Bad Boss.” Your boss, of course, is the person who you work for. It’s a dialogue between Tom and K atie. Tom says, “I wonder how much longer we have to put up with Dennis?” How  much longer means how much more time. “I wonder how much longer this tele vision show will last. I wonder how much longer I will have to wait for my d octor. I wonder how much more time.” To “put up with” means to tolerate. Whe n we say, for example, “I have to put up with the noise” - means I have to li ve with it, even though it is

bothering me. And to “put up with” is always referr ing to something negative that is happening, that you have to live with. You can’t  do anything about it, you have to tolerate it. I have to put up with screaming chi ldren out in the street. I have to put up with dogs that are barking next door to me -  both of those things are true, by the way.

Well, in the dialogue Tom says, “I have to put up w ith Dennis” or Tom says, “We will have to put up with Dennis” - means we have to  have him as our boss, even though we don’t like it. He says, he, Dennis, is the most “incompetent” boss I’ve ever worked for. “Incompetent” (incompetent) means that you are not competent. “In” (in) as a prefix here means “not” and to be co mpetent means you’re able to do something, that you have the talent, you have the ability. So to be “incompetent” means that you do not have the talent , you do not have the ability or capacity to do something, and it’s of course a n egative word. If you say to someone, “You’re incompetent,” that’s a very negati ve insult, a very negative way of expressing your opinion, even if it’s true. Well , Kim, Katie rather - says, “He’s not that bad is he? I don’t have much contact with him.” To have “contact” (contact) with someone means that you talk to them,  or you see them, that you have some relationship with them that you have to c ommunicate with them. So “contact with” - here means the same as much commun ication with him, I don’t have to talk to him or see him, and so forth.

Tom says, “Are you kidding?” - means “Are you jokin g? He’s always sleeping on the job.” Well, “to sleep” of course, is what we do  at night and to “sleep on the job” means that you are sleeping or not doing what you are supposed to do. It doesn’t mean that he’s actually sleeping at his des k, for example. The expression “to be sleeping on the job” means you are not doing  your job. You are not doing what you’re supposed to do. If you are supposed to be working on your computer, typing a report, and you are instead look ing at different websites, or listening to ESL Podcast, you are sleeping on the j ob. You are not doing what you are supposed to be doing.

Tom says that the other day he was - Dennis, was su pposed to keep an eye on the supervisors. To “keep an eye (eye) on” someone means that you are supposed to watch them, you are supposed to take ca re of them. This expression can be used in lots of different ways. F or example, if you are sitting at a café, and you have your computer, your laptop com puter, and you need to go to the bathroom, you need to go to the restroom, yo u may say to your friend, “Could you keep an eye on my computer?” - means “Co uld you make sure no one steals it?” in this case, make sure that nothin g happens to it. So to keep an eye on is to watch, to supervise, to look after som ething.

Well, Dennis was supposed to keep an eye on the sup ervisors and of course, “supervisors” are bosses. In this case, people who are in the top management of a company. Tom says, “Instead of doing what he was supposed to do, in place of that, Dennis went to a baseball game, and the super visors ended up stranded at the downtown office.” “Ended up” (ended) - “up” (up ) - two words - to “end up” means to result in after a series of things happen.  The last thing that happens is how something ends up. For example, “I wanted to go  to the movies last night, but it was raining. So I ended up watching televisi on instead.” Usually, we use that expression when one thing is supposed to happe n but it doesn’t. So you do something different.

Well here, Dennis was supposed to keep an eye on the supervisors, but he didn’t do that, he did something else and the result was t hat the supervisors ended up stranded at the downtown office. “To be stranded” ( stranded) - to be stranded means to be left somewhere with no transportation. If you are driving your car down the street, and you run out of gas, you have no more gasoline, you are stranded on the street. You are stranded at that pl ace means you don’t have any transportation. Well, in this case, the supervisors  were stranded at the downtown office. They were visiting from Salt Lake City. Sal t Lake City is a city in Utah - the state of Utah, and they ended up stranded. They had  no transportation, they couldn’t go anywhere and they were left at the down town office. Usually, we are stranded at some location. You could be stranded at  the airport - means your flight was cancelled or the airplane had a problem and you couldn’t go to where you wanted to go; you were stranded at that place.

Katie says that, “It’s hard to believe that Dennis would fall down on the job like that.” To “fall (fall) - down” (down) - two words - “to fall down on the job,” that expression means similar to be sleeping on the job,  not to do your job. Usually, it means when you do something wrong. So not only are you not doing it, but you are often doing it wrong. But in general, “to fall down on the job” means to not be doing the work you are supposed to be doing, like s ome of you right now, listening to this podcast. Tom says, “It’s not only that” - means that is not the only reason - it’s not only that. He says, “Dennis is always passing the buck.”  To “pass (pass) the buck” (buck) - means to give the responsibility for somet hing that went wrong to someone else. So, for example, your boss tells you to email one of your clients - one of your customers, and you forget to email them , and your boss talks to you and says, “Why didn’t you email this person?” and y ou say, “Oh, I thought John was going to e-mail him.” You are passing the buck,  you are putting the blame or the responsibility for something that went wrong on to someone else. There’s a famous expression for an American president, Harry S. Truman, who was president of the United States in the 1940s and ear ly 1950s, he had a sign - the

president had a sign on his desk that said, “The bu ck stops here,” meaning that he was ultimately responsible. If something went wr ong, he was the one to blame, because of course, he’s the president, he’s at the top of the government. So, “to pass the buck” means to give the responsibi lity for something that went wrong, to someone else, to blame someone else.

Tom says that “Every time something goes wrong at t he factory, Dennis blames everyone but himself.” A “factory” (factory) is a p lace where you make something. So you could have a computer factory, where they ma ke computers, or a toy factory where they make toys. In this case, he says  that “Dennis blames everyone but himself” - means he blames everyone ex cept himself. He doesn’t take the responsibility himself.

Katie says, “If he’s as bad as you say he is, he mu st be on his way out.” “To be on your way out” means that you are going to be lea ving this job or this position soon. Usually, it means that you are probably going  to be fired, that you are going to lose your job. You have not lost it yet, b ut you are going to. If you say, “Oh, he’s on his way out” - means he’s going to be leaving his job, and perhaps being fired from his job soon. Well, Katie says tha t if Dennis is as bad as Tom says Dennis is, he must be on his way out. He’ll pr obably be leaving.

Katie then says, “But you know what they say, bette r the devil you know, than the devil you don’t.” “You know what they say” - that e xpression we use before a proverb, and a proverb (proverb) is a famous saying  or expression. The famous saying or expression that Katie uses here is “Bette r the devil you know, than the devil you don’t.” A “devil” (devil) is of course an  evil person. In the Christian religion, the devil is the person that tries to mak e you do something wrong - do evil. Well, the devil here when we say, “Better the  devil you know” means it’s better to have someone bad that you are familiar wi th than to bring someone else in new, who maybe even worse than the person you ha ve now. So better when we say, “Better the devil” - that’s short for “it i s better that we have the devil - the bad person, the bad boss in this story, that we are  familiar with, than do lose him and maybe we’ll get an even worse boss. “Better the  devil you know, than the devil you don’t.”

Tom says, “Yeah I know, but I’m willing to take my chances.” “To take your chances” means I’m willing to risk something worse.  It means I’m open to the possibility that something may go wrong. We usually  use this expression when someone warns us, or tells us that something bad co uld happen. If we do what we plan on doing and you say, “Oh, I’ll take my cha nces.” So, for example, you want to go to the beach in the summertime and your friend says, “Well it’s going to be very crowded, lots of people there. It may be  difficult to find a place to

park,” and you say, “I’ll take my chances” - means I’m going to try it anyway. It’s something usually that you say when you are rejecti ng someone’s advice. When you are saying, “I’m not going to follow what you t ell me to do.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a na tive rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Tom: I wonder how much longer we’ll have to put up with Dennis. He is the most incompetent boss I’ve ever worked for.

Katie: He’s not that bad, is he? I don’t have much contact with him.

Tom: Are you kidding? He’s always sleeping on the j ob. The other day, he was supposed to keep an eye on the supervisors visiting  from Salt Lake City. Instead, I heard that he went to a baseball game and the sup ervisors ended up stranded at the downtown office.

Katie: It’s hard to believe that he’d fall down on the job like that.

Tom: It’s not only that. He’s always passing the bu ck. Every time something goes wrong at the factory, he blames everyone but himsel f.

Katie: If he’s as bad as you say he is, he must be on his way out. But, you know what they say, “Better the devil you know, than the  devil you don’t.”

# Training a New Employee

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast Num ber 162, “Training a New Employee.” You are listening to English as a Second Language P odcast Episode 162. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from t he Center for Educational Development in the beautiful Los Angeles, Californi a.

This podcast is going to be about someone training a new worker, or a new employee. Let’s go!

[start of dialogue]

Even though, I’ve only been on the job for six mont hs, my manager asked me to train the new hire. She was starting today and when  she arrived, we got down to business.

Akira: So, the first thing I’ll do is to give you a  run down of the duties of the job. Your main responsibilities will be to ensure that t he reports are finished each week, make any adjustments that need to be made, an d distribute them to each department. Is that clear so far?

Frances: Sure. That seems pretty straightforward. W ho do I report to?

Akira: Your immediate supervisor is Ida Funck. We a ll work under her in this department. Okay, here’s the employee manual. Make sure you read it.

Frances: Great. Thanks. Now, when do I get a break?

Akira: A break? You’ve only been here a half an hou r.

Frances: Has it been that long? I need some coffee.

Needless to say, it was a very, very long day.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue today is about a worker, an employee, and an employee of course is just someone who works for someone else. One of the employees in this company is training a new employee, and the story b egins by him saying that, he

has only been on the job for six months. “Even thou gh, I’ve only been on the job for six months,” To be “on the job” means to be wor king at a particular place, or for a particular company. “How long have you been o n the job?” means how long have you worked for this company. And the person he re is saying, “Even though I’ve only been on the job for six months,” which wo uld be the same as “Despite the fact that I have only been on the job, my manag er asked me to train a new hire.” So in the first part of the sentence, he’s s aying, “Well I’ve only been here for a short time, for six months, but my boss still  wants me to do training, even though I don’t have very much experience myself.” T o “train” someone (train) of course means to tell them what to do, to show them how they are to do their job. And so, when you get a new job, you often go throug h a week or two, or maybe a month or two of training where someone gives you in struction, teaches you how to do a specific job.

A hire (hire) is an employee, a person who was hire d by the company. So, in the story here when we hear about the “new hire,” we me an the new person who is now working for the company, the new person who jus t got a job at the company. Well, this person was starting today and when she a rrived, the narrator, Akira, says, “We got down to business.” To “get down to bu siness”  - that expression means to start working, to begin doing what you are  supposed to do. We can use this expression in business, but we can also use it  in other places, such as in school. A teacher might say to her students, “You t wo, get down to business! Let’s start working.” “Let’s get down to business” means start doing what you’re supposed to do. This is something I have a great di fficulty doing, especially on Monday morning. It’s hard to get down to business. I want to go on the Internet. I want to look at the news. Well, you know, that’s wh at you’re doing right now, some of you, by listening to ESL Podcast.

Well, Akira says the first thing that he’s going to  give this new employee is a run- down of the duties of the job. Basically what he is  saying here is that he’s going to explain to the new employee what that person, wh at that worker, has to do in her job. To give someone a “run down” - and that’s two words (run down) -  to give someone a run down of something, or a run down  on something, means to explain to them what happened, to give them informa tion that they need to know. For example: Yesterday I went to a meeting that you  were not able to go to. Let me give you a run down of the meeting. I’m going to  tell you what happened at that meeting. The duties (duties) of a job are what  you have to do. They’re your responsibilities, the things, or the tasks that you  have to do for a job.

So Akira says, “Well let me tell you what you have to do for this new job.” Remember he’s training in a new employee. He says, “Your main responsibilities,” the main duties. When we say mai n here (main), we mean the

most important, the principal responsibilities, the  responsibilities that are most important. “Your main responsibilities” he says, “w ill be to ensure that the reports are finished each week.” “To ensure” (ensure) means  to make sure, to verify, to confirm, to be responsible for something. “I need t o ensure that I have a car tomorrow morning to take my boss to the airport” me ans I have to take care of that. It’s my responsibility.

There’s another word that sounds the same, almost t he same as ensure, and that’s insure (insure). In fact, they normally woul d be pronounced the same, but they’re spelled differently and they mean different  things. To “insure” (insure) means to get insurance for something. Usually, you pay a company money and the company promises that, if something bad happens , they will pay you money to fix it. For example, on your car, you can have c ar insurance. So if you have an accident -  you’re sleeping and you run into a tree  - if you have car insurance, the insurance company will pay you to fix the car. That ’s the verb “to insure” (insure). To “ensure” (ensure) means to make sure, to take re sponsibility for something. Well, one of the responsibilities is to ensure that  the reports are finished each week. Another one is to make any adjustments that n eed to be made. An adjustment, (adjustment) an adjustment is a change,   - usually, when you have to correct something or fix something. I need to make some adjustments in the amount of money that I said we were going to make t his year. I have to make some changes in that. Finally, Akira says that the new employee has to di stribute these reports to each department, and to “distribute” (distribute) means to give to people, to give to (usually) different people. We use that verb “to di stribute” when we are talking about a piece of information, a report, a letter th at goes to several different people.

Well Frances, the new employee, says that everythin g that Akira is saying seems pretty straight-forward. To be “straight-forward” ( straight-forward), all one word, straight-forward - to be straight-forward means to be clear, to be simple, to be not complicated. Usually we use this word when we are t alking about a set of plans or directions or instructions, things that you have  to do, usually procedures or steps that you have to take - can be straight-forwa rd. For example: The directions for getting from my house to Santa Monic a, California, are very straight-forward. You drive up Centinela Avenue, yo u take a left on Santa Monica Boulevard, you drive one mile and you are in Santa Monica, California, the city here in Los Angeles.

Well, that’s straight-forward. It’s simple, it’s cl ear, it’s plain. Notice that Frances says, “That seems pretty straight-forward,” “pretty ” here means very. Remember, you can say something is pretty, as an adjective me ans, it’s beautiful, but when

you use it as an adverb, it means very. So, that se ems pretty straight-forward. That seems very straight-forward.

Frances says, “Who do I report to?” meaning who do I talk to about what I should do? Who is my boss? Notice she says, “Who do I repo rt to?” Technically, you probably will read in a grammar book that the corre ct way is, “Whom do I report to?” or “To whom do I report?” However, in both con versation and in writing now, in English, many people just say “who” and now “who m.” It’s quite common, probably more common. In fact, if you say, “Whom do  I report to?” some people might think you are trying to impress them, to show  off, to show that you know grammar better than they do. In actual conversation , it’s very common for people just to say “who” even though, the grammatical form , the traditional form, is “whom.”

Well, Akira says that Frances should report to Ida Funck, the name of her immediate supervisor. Well, a supervisor, you proba bly know (supervisor), all one word - a supervisor is a boss, is someone who is in  charge of, or is responsible for, usually a group of people. When you say, your “immediate” supervisor, you mean that it is the person who you talk to, one lev el above where you are. That is, you may have a boss, and your boss has a boss, and your boss’s boss has a boss, and so on and so forth. In a big company, the re are many bosses, and some bosses work for other bosses.

Well, your immediate supervisor is the boss who is one level above you; who is the person that you talk to, who gives you orders. He has, or she may have another boss that is his or her immediate superviso r. Well Akira says that, “We all work under her, the immediate supervisor in this de partment.” “To work under” someone means that we are their employees. They are  our boss, or in this case, she is our boss. I work under Lucy Tse means Lucy T se is my boss. Akira then says, “Okay, here’s the employee manual.” A manual (manual) is a book that gives you instructions on how to do something. You can have a manual for your computer that tells you what you should do, and how  you should do things with your computer. Usually, most people don’t read thos e manuals. I know I don’t, but an “employee manual” is what a company gives to  a worker, to an employee, telling them all the different rules and regulation s of the company. Akira says, “Make sure that you read the manual.” And of course  to “make sure” is the same as to “ensure” (ensure). In other words, you’re res ponsible for this.

Frances says “Great, now when do I get a break?” A break (break) is when you stop working for a short period of time. And Akira says, “A break? You’ve only been here a half an hour.” Notice that that express ion, “a half an hour” (a half an hour), four words, a half an hour. You can also say , “a half hour.” Sometimes

people will say, “a half hour” with no “an” in betw een. Sometimes they’ll say, “A half an hour” -  they mean the same thing.

Frances says, “Has it been that long? I need some c offee.” Of course, Akira is not very happy that this new worker, this new emplo yee, wants to take a break after only a half an hour. And so he says, “Needles s to say, it was a very, very long day.” That expression “Needless (needless) to say,” needless to say means obviously, it was a very long day. I don’t need to tell you that it was a very long day -  “needless to say.” And we use that expressio n when we are going to tell someone something that should be obvious to them, t hat they should already know because it is obvious. It is clear from the si tuation.

Well now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at  a native rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Even though, I’ve only been on the job for six mont hs, my manager asked me to train the new hire. She was starting today and when  she arrived, we got down to business.

Akira: So, the first thing I’ll do is to give you a  run down of the duties of the job. Your main responsibilities will be to ensure that t he reports are finished each week, make any adjustments that need to be made, an d distribute them to each department. Is that clear so far?

Frances: Sure. That seems pretty straightforward. W ho do I report to?

Akira: Your immediate supervisor is Ida Funck. We a ll work under her in this department. Okay, here’s the employee manual. Make sure you read it.

Frances: Great. Thanks. Now, when do I get a break?

Akira: A break? You’ve only been here a half an hou r.

Frances: Has it been that long? I need some coffee.

Needless to say, it was a very, very long day. [end of dialogue]

# Saving and Spending Money

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast 163 , “Saving and Spending Money”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 163. I’m your host Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This Podcast is about how people spend money, and h ow people save it. Let’s go! > In my family, there are penny- pinchers and spendth rifts, and everything in between. My brother Frank has the reputation for be ing stingy with money. He likes to save up and only spend when he has to. I b et he has a lot stashed away. He's careful with money but he does spend it when h e thinks it's necessary, and his wife and kids are very comfortable.
> On the other hand, my brother Jack is known as a sp endthrift. It's not that he's a big spender or a high roller, it's just that he's n ot very careful with money, and doesn't think it's that important. When he has it, he doesn't think twice about spending it. With his friends, he's generous to a f ault. So, what am I? A penny- pincher or a spendthrift? I guess I’m a little of b oth. It depends on who’s asking, and how much they want to borrow.

We’re talking today about the ways that people spen d and save money, our story begins by me describing my family. I say, “In my fa mily, there are penny-pinchers and spendthrifts, and everything in between. A “pen ny-pincher” (penny-pincher) penny-pinchers, plural - penny-pincher without the ‘s’, singular. A penny-pincher is someone who does not spend very much money, who watches every penny, and of course a penny is, in American money, the sm allest amount that you can have. One penny, it’s also called, one cent, (cent) , it’s one one-hundredth of a dollar. So to be a penny-pincher, and to pinch, (pi ncher) here means, to save. To be a penny-pincher means you save every penny that you have. You don’t spend very much money.

Now the opposite of a penny-pincher would be a spen dthrift, and a “spendthrift,” (spendthrift), all one word, is someone who spends all of their money, who doesn’t save their money. They get a dollar, they s pend a dollar. They don’t try to, what we would say, “put it aside,” To “put some thing aside” means to save it for a later time. Now, a spendthrift and a penny-pi ncher are both somewhat negative expressions to describe someone. Most peop le would not describe themselves as either a spendthrift or a penny-pinch er, but spendthrift is particularly negative. Some people might say, “I’m a penny-pincher,” but no one would say, “I’m a spendthrift,” because it’s sort of an insult, it’s a negative expression.

Well I said, “In my family, there are penny-pincher s and spendthrifts, and everything in between,” meaning, there are people b etween the two opposites of saving all your money, and spending all your money,  everything in between. Now, my brother Frank has the reputation for being stingy with money. “Reputation” (reputation) is what someone is known for, what other people say about him or her. So you could have a good reputati on, or you could have a bad reputation, depends on what people say about you. I  think I have mostly a bad reputation. No, I hope not. Well, my brother Frank has a reputation for being stingy, and to be “stingy” (stingy) is the same as being a penny-pincher, but it’s definitely a negative expression, it’s not a positi ve adjective. You say someone is stingy, means even if they should spend money, they  don’t. That is the meaning of the adjective stingy. Well, Frank has the reputa tion for being stingy, we say stingy with money, but you can just say, stingy. He  likes to save up, and only spend when he has to. The expression, “to save up,”  two words, that verb means basically the same as “to save.” It’s like a lot of  two-word verbs where you have a preposition like “up” that comes after the verb. It ’s more to give emphasis. So I’m going to save to buy a new car. I’m going to save u p, to buy a new car. They mean basically the same, but the “up” gives it a li ttle more emphasis.

Well, my brother likes to save up and only spend wh en he has to, and of course “spend” (spend) means when you give someone else yo ur money for something. I say that “I bet he has a lot stashed away.” I “be t” (bet) means I’m guessing. Of course, to bet as a verb, is something you do when you gamble. “I’m going to play poker,” or “I’m going to Las Vegas and play in  the casino, and when I go there, I bet,” but here, when someone says, “I bet that” or “I bet he is a spendthrift,” what we mean is that, I guess, in my opinion.

Well, I say that “I bet my brother has a lot stashe d away.” “To stash (stash) away” is a verb which means to save, but usually to save a large amount of something, and you’re saving it for a long period of time. “I have some money stashed away,” means I have money that I’m going to use in the future. The noun, “stash”

means that money that you have. So, “Here’s my stas h” means here’s my money that I’m saving. I say that my brother is “careful with money.” “To be careful with money” means of course that you watch what you spen d, that you don’t just buy things because you want to, and you see it and you like it. “I see the new 17-inch Mac PowerBook, and I want to go and buy it,” but, i f I’m careful with my money, I wait or I’m very slow to buy something.

Well, my brother Frank is careful with money, but I  say he does spend it when he thinks it’s necessary, when he has to, he spends it  and his wife and children are comfortable,” meaning they’re not without food, or a house. They’re very comfortable. They have a good life.

Now, I have another brother who is not a penny-pinc her, and I say in the story, “On the other hand, my brother Jack, is known is a spendthrift.” “On the other hand” is when we are going to give in a story a dif ferent example, or an opposite example. Usually, you hear those two expressions to gether, “On the one hand, I don’t want to go to the movie,” “On the other hand,  I have a free ticket, so I should go,”- so when you’re comparing two different  things that are different or opposite.

Well, I say, “On the other hand, my brother Jack is  known as a spendthrift,” someone who spends a lot of money. “It’s not that h e’s a big spender or a high- roller,” when we say someone is a big spender, we m ean, you can guess that they spend a lot of money. A high-roller, high (hig h) roller (roller),  a high-roller is an expression that comes from gambling. When you ga mble for example, in Las Vegas or in Monte Carlo or other places, many times  you gamble by rolling the dice - two little squares that have numbers on them , right? We call those dice (dice). When you roll the dice, you throw the dice down. The most famous game for that is called  craps” (craps), which is kind of a strange word in English, but that’s what it’s called “craps.” Well, someone who’ s a high-roller is someone who spends a lot of money, either by gambling or by going out and spending their money to buy different things. And it’s a term that  means the person isn’t very good with money. Usually, they’ll spend a lot of mo ney, that’s a high-roller. Now, it’s not necessarily a negative term. If you are ri ch, you can be a high-roller. You can spend a lot of money, because you have a lot mo ney.

Well I say that, “It’s not that my brother is a big  spender, or a high-roller, it’s just that he’s not very careful with money.” Notice the expression, “It’s not that, it’s just that”. When we are explaining something to som eone and you want to give them the reason why something happened, or why some one did something, you can start by giving them something that isn’t true,  “It’s not that I don’t like Tom Cruise, it’s just that I think he’s not the best pe rson to marry.” That would be an

example, it’s not that, it’s just that. So when you  say, “It’s just that,” you’re giving the real reason - the true reason, and when you say , “It’s not that,” you’re saying what isn’t true - what you don’t believe is true.

Well, my brother is not careful with money. He does n’t think that being careful with money is important. When he has it, meaning wh en he has money, he doesn’t think twice about spending it. The expressi on, “to think twice” (twice), two times, to think twice means to be careful - to thin k about something before you make a decision, before you take an action. So some one may say to you, “Think twice about not going to school today, because ther e’s a big test, and if you don’t go, you will get a poor grade”. The expression, “He  doesn’t think twice,” “Don’t think twice,” means they don’t think about it at al l. They just go ahead and do whatever it means. It’s a neutral expression, it’s neither positive nor negative. Someone says, “Don’t think twice about calling me f or help,” means “Don’t worry, you can call me for help anytime.”

Well here I say that, “My brother doesn’t think twi ce about spending his money.” “With his friends” I say, “he’s generous to a fault ”. To be “generous” (generous), means that you give someone money or time, or somet hing that will help them, someone who is generous gives other people money wh o need help. The expression, “to be generous to a fault,” (fault) me ans basically that they are very generous, that they help everyone that they can. He ’s generous to a fault, he likes to help everyone who needs help, and that’s w hat the expression means here.

Well, I end the story by asking what I am. “Am I a penny-pincher, or a spendthrift?” and I say, “I’m a little of both,” me ans of course, I’m partly a penny- pincher and I’m partly a spendthrift. “It depends o n who’s asking and how much they want to borrow,” means it depends on who’s ask ing me for money. “To borrow” (borrow) means that you ask someone else for money. So it depends on who wants money from me. I might be a spendthrift i f I like them, and I might be a penny-pincher if I don’t.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at a native  rate of speech.

[start of story]

In my family, there are penny- pinchers and spendth rifts, and everything in between. My brother Frank has the reputation for be ing stingy with money. He likes to save up and only spend when he has to. I b et he has a lot stashed away. He's careful with money but he does spend it when h e thinks it's necessary, and his wife and kids are very comfortable.

 On the other hand, my brother Jack is known as a sp endthrift. It's not that he's a big spender or a high roller, it’s just that he's n ot very careful with money, and doesn't think it's that important. When he has it, he doesn't think twice about spending it. With his friends, he's generous to a f ault. So, what am I? A penny- pincher, or a spendthrift? I guess I’m a little of both. It depends on who’s asking, and how much they want to borrow.

# A Marriage Proposal I

Today's podcast is called “A Marriage Proposal (Part I).”  We're going to hear about a man who wants to marry a woman and how he is going to ask her.  Let's get started!

<start of story> I've been trying to get up the nerve to ask my girlfriend to marry me. We have been dating for almost a year, and I think she's the one. I went shopping for engagement rings and really hated the experience. I wasn't sure what kind of ring she'd like and it took me a long time to decide. Finally, with the help of the saleswoman, I picked one.

So, I've got the ring, now I've just got to find the right time to pop the question. I needed to think for a romantic way to propose. I've watched enough romantic movies with  my girlfriend to know that the proposal has to be something special. I thought about taking her on a trip to Paris and asking her in the “city of love,” but I spent all of my money on the ring, so that's out of the question. I thought about writing her a love poem and proposing in the poem, but I'm a terrible writer. I thought about serenading her outside the window, but with my voice, I'm sure the neighbors would call the police.

I don't know what to do. How do I ask her to marry me? <end of story>

 Today's podcast is about a man who wants to propose to his girlfriend.  The verb to “propose” here means to ask someone to marry you.  And the noun is a “proposal.”  We can also us the verb “propose” for other things, of course.  To “propose” something is to recommend or put something forward, or to give someone an idea and ask if they will accept it or not.  But here, it is to ask someone to marry you.  And, of course, traditionally, a man would ask the woman if she would marry him.

Well, the man in this story says that he's been trying “to get up the nerve” to ask my girlfriend – his girlfriend…not my girlfriend!  Better be careful…to ask his girlfriend to marry him.  The expression, “to get up the nerve” means to get the confidence, to be confident.  If you are scared about something or you don't want to do something, you may need to get up your nerve; that means you need to say to yourself, “Okay, I'm ready” and not be afraid, not be scared, to have confidence.  Well, he's trying to get up the nerve to ask the girlfriend to marry him, to be his wife.

He says that, “We've been dating for almost a year” - we have been dating, we have been romantically involved with each other.  Of course, to “date” means to be romantically interested and involved in someone else.  They've been dating for a year and “I think,” he says, “she's the one.”  When we say “she's the one” or “he's the one” (like the number 1), we mean this is the one for me, this is my perfect person, this is the person I should marry.

So, the man goes shopping for “engagement rings.” An “engagement” is a noun and it means the promise that two people have to marry each other. So, when a man proposes or asks a woman to marry him, they get engaged. The verb is “to get engaged,” and to get engaged which means now they are planning on getting married, but they're not married yet. They may get married in five months or in six months or maybe even in a year.  But, during that time, they are engaged and that time is called their “engagement.” Well, an engagement ring then, is not the same as a wedding ring; it's a ring that a woman would wear to indicate that they are married, or they are going to get married, but they are not married yet. So, an engagement ring… not everyone gets an engagement ring, but it's commo n.

So, this poor guy goes shopping for engagement rings, one for his, what we would call (after he gets engaged), the woman is called the “fiancée.”  My fiancée

 is the woman that I'm going to marry.  My girlfriend would say, “my fiancé,” is the man I'm going to marry. So, “fiancée” is the person that you are planning on marrying.  In this case, he has to buy a ring for his fiancée, and he says he wasn't sure what kind of ring his girlfriend would like.  And it took him a long time to decide or a long time “to make up his mind.”  “To make up your mind” means to decide.  Finally, with the help of the saleswoman - a “saleswoman,” all one word, is, of course, the person who is selling the rings, the person who is helping you at the jewelry store where you would go to buy a ring, a jewelry store.  With the help of the saleswoman, he picked one or he selected one.

“Now,” he says, “I've got the ring.”  Now, I've just got to or just have “to find the right time to pop the question.”  “Find the right time” means to find the right opportunity, the right moment.  To “pop the question” means to ask someone to marry you.  Notice that we say to “pop the question,” we don't say what question, because the question is always the same: “Will you marry me?” And we always use that expression “to pop the question” when someone is asking someone else to marry them.  It's only used for marriage, you don't pop the question about going on a trip.  We only use that expression for two people who are going to be married, usually the man, traditionally, will pop the question to the woman.

He says in the story that he needs to think of a romantic way to propose.  A “romantic” means, of course, well, it comes from the noun “romance” and the idea is that it is something that is very loving towards…yo u do something very loving towards the other person.  You do something that, usually the woman, will find to be very special, something that sends her a special message.  These are things that are romantic.  He's trying to think of a romantic way to propose, to ask his girlfriend to marry him.  He says “he's watched enough romantic movies with my girlfriend to know that the proposal has to be something special.”  It means he's watched many movies, so many movies, that he understands that the time that he asks his girlfriend to marry him has to be a very special time.  He has to make it a special time.  Well, he says he thought about taking his girlfriend to Paris, France, and asking her to marry him in the “city of love.”  Paris, of course, at least in the United States, Paris is considered one of the most romantic cities in the world, and many people consider that.  Paris is a beautiful city.  So, that's considered very romantic, to go to Paris.

And the man in the story says that, unfortunately, he spent all of his money on the ring.  He doesn't have any money to go to Paris, so that's “out of the

 question.” To be “out of the question” means that it isn't possible; there is no possibility of doing that.  If your son or daughter asks you to borrow the car; they want to borrow the car from you.  And you say, “That's out of the question,” means there's absolutely no possibility that that is going to happen.

The man says he thought about writing his girlfriend a love poem.  A “poem,” of course, is a type of literature.  We sometimes call it “verse”: Roses are red, Violets are blue. The sky is beautiful And so are you! Isn't that nice?  The traditional poem, romantic poem begins with:  “Roses are red...(“rose” of course, a type of flower)...Violets are blue (again, a different type of flower).  And then, you have to rhyme something with the word “blue.”  Well, that would be a love poem, but not a serious love poem, because that's sort of a joke to say “Roses are red, violets are blue.  I believe in myse lf and so do you.”  I don't know...something that you would say that would rhyme with “blue.”  Well, this love poem is one idea that he has to propose to her, to propose to her in a love poem.  Unfortunately, he's a terrible writer.  “Terrible” – in other words, he's a very bad writer.

He thought about serenading his girlfriend.  To “serenade” is the verb.  He thought about serenading her outside her window.  To serenade means to sing to someone and the traditional way would be to go to a woman's house and stand outside of her bedroom window and have a guitar or someone with you who can play a musical instrument, and you would sing to her something that was lovely and beautiful.  Unfortunately, the man in the story says, “With my voice, I'm sure the neighbors would call the police.”  The expression here “with my voice” means when we are talking about “my voice.”  “Considering my voice, I'm sure the neighbors would call the police” because his voice was so bad, the neighbors would complain about his singing, and so they would call the police and have the police officers come to the house.

So, the man ends the story by saying, “I don't know what to do. How do I ask her to marry me?” Well, to find out, you have to come back and listen to Part II of this story.

Now let's listen to the story at a native rate of speech.

 <start of story> I've been trying to get up the nerve to ask my girlfriend to marry me. We have been dating for almost a year, and I think she's the one. I went shopping for engagement rings and really hated the experience. I wasn't sure what kind of ring she'd like and it took me a long time to decide. Finally, with the help of the saleswoman, I picked one.

So, I've got the ring, now I've just got to find the right time to pop the question. I needed to think for a romantic way to propose. I've watched enough romantic movies with  my girlfriend to know that the proposal has to be something special. I thought about taking her on a trip to Paris and asking her in the “city of love,” but I spent all of my money on the ring, so that's out of the question. I thought about writing her a love poem and proposing in the poem, but I'm a terrible writer. I thought about serenading her outside the window, but with my voice, I'm sure the neighbors would call the police.

I don't know what to do. How do I ask her to marry me? <end of story>

# The Home Improvement Store

complete transcript of our podcast, everything we say on the podcast, as well as lots of additional tips and information on English and the English expressions that we use in our podcasts each week. So, be sure to go to our website and take a look.  You can also see a free sample of these new “Learning Guides” for each podcast so you can see exactly what exciting things we have to offer.

Today's podcast is called, “The Home Improvement Store.”  A home improvement store is a place you go to buy things to fix your house. So, let's go!

<start of story> When you own a house, there is always something that needs work. I've been putting off repainting the garage and I decided that I would do it this weekend.

I went to the home improvement store early in the morning to get the supplies I'd need. I walked into the huge store and began looking for the paint department. I walked through the garden center and the lumber department, but couldn't find the paint supplies. I tried to find a store employee to ask about it, but there was no one in sight. I walked down the plumbing aisles and finally found the paint department.

I looked at the paint swatches and found the color I wanted. I took a number to have my paint mixed. When my number was called, I gave the employee the swatch of the color I wanted and he told me he would call me again when it was ready. In the meantime, I got some brushes and rags. After about twenty minutes, the employee called my number and I picked up my paint. I took the

ESL Podcast  168 – The Home Improvement Store

 paint and the other supplies and got into a checkout line.

After all that, I was exhausted. And I hadn't even started painting yet! Maybe I'll do that next weekend. <end of story>

In this podcast, I go to the home improvement store. Again, that's a place where you can buy things to fix or change your house. I start the story by saying that when you own a house, there's always something that needs work. To “need work” means to need improving. We use this in lots of different context, for example, “This essay needs work.” It means it needs to be better; it needs to be improved. Or you can say, “Boy, his singing really needs work.” That's what people say about me. It means it can be a lot, lot better. It needs to be improved.

Well, a house always has something that needs work that you have to fix or change. I say that I've been putting off repainting the garage and I decided I would do it this weekend. To “put off” (two words) means to delay, to wait, to not do something now and decide to do it later. “I'm going to put off going to the dentist until I don't have any more teeth left. Then, I will go to the dentist” - not a good idea!  Well, “to put off things” means to wait, to delay. Usually, we put off things that we don't like, that we don't want to do. “I'm putting off paying my taxes this year.” I don't want to pay my taxes. But, if I don't, the government will put me in jail, so I will pay them.

Well, in the story, I'm putting off repainting the garage. To “paint,” of course, means to put paint on a wall or--outside your house--to apply paint. The verb “to repaint,” means, of course, to paint again. So, for example, if you paint the outside of your house, a wooden house, and after a few years, the paint is going to start to come off. We would say it's going to start to “peel.” It means it starts to slowly come off the wood. Well, then, you have to put new paint on there. We have to repaint it. My garage needs to be repainted. This is true. If I took a picture of my garage, you would see it needs to be repainted. My wife has been asking me to do that, and I've been putting it off.

Well, I've finally decided to go to the home improvement store. And in the United States, there are several big home improvement stores that have lots of different things. Well, I went early in the morning to get the supplies I'd need.  The “supplies” are all of the things that you need to do something, to perform something. Usually, these are tools or instruments or materials that you use to do

ESL Podcast  168 – The Home Improvement Store

 something, to build something, for example. You can have art supplies, if you are painting someone's picture.  You can get the supplies that you need; those are the paint and the paintbrush and so forth. Well, I went to a huge store. “Huge” - some people pronounce it “Uge,” with the “H” almost not being pronounced…but, a “huge” store is, of course, a large store, a very large store.

I began by looking in the paint department. The different sections of a store are often called departments. A “department” is a section or a division of a store. We also have what are called “department stores.” Those are stores that sell clothes and jewelry and shoes—all sorts of different things, beds, refrigerators. Those are called department stores because they have different departments, different sections. Well, in a home improvement store, they have different sections.  We don't call it a department store, but it does have departments. And so I go to the paint department looking for - guess what? - paint. That's right.

I then walked through the garden center. The “garden center” is a place where you can buy plants and trees and bushes, things that you would put in a garden. A garden is usually what you have in the back of a house. Many houses in the United States have gardens in the back. Well, I walked through the garden center, and again, garden center is the same as garden department, and I also walked through the lumber department. The “lumber department” is where you buy wood if you're going to build something. Another word for wood is lumber. A person who works in cutting down trees used to be called a “lumberjack.” But, lumber is just a general term for wood, wood that you use to build something. Well, I walked through the garden center and the lumber department, but I could not find the paint supplies. I tried to find a store employee [accent on last syllable] – or “employee” [accent on second syllable], either pronunciation is correct – to ask, but there was no one in sight. There was no one “in sight” (two words). When we say there was “no one in sight” we mean there is no one that I can see, there is no one in that area. This is actually pretty commo n in these home improvement stores; they're so big that when you go into them, it's very difficult to find an employee to help you. This is what we mean by no one in sight. There's no one you can see. “I went to the beach. It was raining, and there was no one in sight,” means I couldn't see anyone; no one was there.

Well, I walked down the plumbing aisles and finally found the paint department. “Plumbing” refers to the pipes that bring water in and out of your house. They bring other things out of your house, too, but water is one thing they bring in. So, if you want to have water in your house, you have to have a “plumber,” a person

ESL Podcast  168 – The Home Improvement Store

 who will put the plumbing or the pipes in your house. And, of course, “pipes” are round, long things, usually made of metal or plastic that you can put water through. Well, that’s the plumbing department, but I used the word “aisles” here. An aisle is where you walk in between two different—usually in a store—two different shelves. A “shelf” - singular, “shelves” - plural, are where you put things that people can buy. And so, the aisle is a small path where you walk in between these two shelves that have all of the things that you are looking for, that you are going to buy.

Well,  finally I find the paint department and I take a look at the paint swatches. A “swatch” is a little sample of, usually, either a color of paint or it could also be a swatch of cloth, of the material that you make clothes out of. A swatch is a small sample of something, usually, so you can see what the color is. If it's a cloth, if it's something that you make clothes out of, you can feel it as well as see the color. So, a paint swatch is, usually, it’s is a little card, a little piece of paper, that has maybe 1 inch or maybe 2 inches, a square of 1 inch or 2 inches, that has the color, so you can see the color. You can take a paint swatch and you can hold it next to the wall that you are going to paint and you can see what the color would be.

Well, I looked at the paint swatches and I took a number to have my paint mixed. When you go to the home improvement stores and you want to buy some paint, and you want a particular color, usually, they have to make that color for you; they have to mix the paint. I say, “I take a number” and that means that they have, in many stores, little paper numbers or pieces of paper that have numbers on them, and you take one, and then you wait until they say your number. We would say, until they “call your number,” and then you can go up and they will help you. So, it's a way of the store being able to help people in order. That is, the first people who gets there will get help first and the last people who get there will be helped last.

Well, I took a number and when my number was called - when they said my number, “Number 17!” - and then I go, “Oh, that's me!” and I go up and I give them the little piece of paper that says “17” on it. Well, I gave the employee the swatch of the color I wanted and he told me he would call me again when it was ready. So, in the meantime, I got some brushes and rags. “In the meantime” (“meantime” – all one word) means while I was waiting, while something else was happening. “In the meantime” is when you are waiting for something else and so you decide to do something different while you are waiting. Well, while I was

ESL Podcast  168 – The Home Improvement Store

 waiting, in the meantime, I got some brushes - and, of course, a “brush” is what you use to put the paint on the wall or on the house or on the garage.  A “rag” is a small towel, a small piece of cloth that you use to clean things or to wipe up something that's dirty. After about twenty minutes then, the employee called my number, said, “This is ready.”  I picked up my paint and I went to the checkout line. The “checkout line” is the place where you pay for something in a big store. Of course, there are always lots of people waiting, so we call it a checkout line.

Well, I end my story by saying, “After all of that, I was exhausted.”  “After all of that” or you can say, “after all that” with no “of” (they both mean the same). That expression, “after all of that,” means after I have finished doing all of those things or after all of those things were completed, I was exhausted. To be “exhausted” means to be very, very tired. And because I'm very tired, I decide that I will actually start painting next week. Of course, what I am doing is putting it off again.

Now let's listen to the story this time at a native rate of speech.

<start of story> When you own a house, there is always something that needs work. I've been putting off repainting the garage and I decided that I would do it this weekend.

I went to the home improvement store early in the morning to get the supplies I'd need. I walked into the huge store and began looking for the paint department. I walked through the garden center and the lumber department, but couldn't find the paint supplies. I tried to find a store employee to ask about it, but there was no one in sight. I walked down the plumbing aisles and finally found the paint department.

I looked at the paint swatches and found the color I wanted. I took a number to have my paint mixed. When my number was called, I gave the employee the swatch of the color I wanted and he told me he would call me again when it was ready. In the meantime, I got some brushes and rags. After about twenty minutes, the employee called my number and I picked up my paint. I took the paint and the other supplies and got into a checkout line.

After all that, I was exhausted. And I hadn't even started painting yet! Maybe I'll do that next weekend. <end of story>

# Describing People¡¦s Looks

# Questions and Answers at a Presentation

complete transcript of this podcast. And that is available on our website.

Today's podcast is going to be about someone who is giving a talk or a presentation in front of a group of business colleagues or people they work with. Let's get started.

<start of story> Our company hired an outside firm to set up a computer system, to help us keep track of the progress on major projects. The company gave us a presentation on how the new system worked. Afterwards, the employees got a chance to ask questions.

Cecilia: So, in a nutshell, those are the features of the new system. Any questions?

Yuri: Yes, I have a question. From your description, it sounds like the new system may be difficult to use. Can you speak to that?

Cecilia: I understand your concern, but actually, the system is very simple to use. I mentioned a lot of features that the system has, but the typical employee won't be using more than two or three on a daily basis. Yes, you have a question?

Alessandro: Yeah, my biggest concern is that all of the employees in the company will have access to the system. How does this affect my projects that have sensitive information?

 Cecilia: That's a good question. One of the key features of the program is that it allows the project manager to limit access for any of his or her projects. Now, if there are no other questions, thank you all for coming and we look forward to working with you in the future. <end of story>

We heard Cecilia give a presentation to a group of employees for a company. The story begins by saying that, “Our company hired a outside firm to set up a computer system.”  A “firm” is another word for a company, an organization. We sometimes use that word, especially for companies that provide services, such as a group of lawyers. We would call that a “law firm.” It's a company, a business that has lawyers in it and does whatever lawyers do, which is...hmm…I 'm not sure. Well, an outside firm is an outside company. When we say “outside,” we mean a company that is not part of our company, a different company. That's a term we'll often use when we are referring to someone or some company that is not  part of your current organization. You may say, for example, “We're going to bring someone in from outside to look at our accounting procedures.” It means we're going to take someone from a different company who doesn't work for us and bring them in to look at our accounting.

Well, the company they've hired is going to set up a computer system. To “set up” means to get something working, to make sure that something is working correctly. You can set up a television, for example. You plug it in, you put the cable in the back for the antenna, and so forth. Well, they're setting up a computer system to help keep track of the progress on major projects. To “keep track of” something means to follow something, to be able to see how something is going over time. For example: “I want to keep track of my weight.” I want to know how much I weigh everyday. So, every morning, I get up and I weigh myse lf.  “To weigh yourself” means to see how much you weigh.  I look down at what we would call the “scale,” that's what you stand on to find how much you weigh. I see, oh, 120 pounds! Wonderful! That's not true, of course. I wish it were 120 pounds. But, that would be to keep track of, so I would write it down everyday. I'm following  how much I weigh everyday.

Well, here, they're keeping track of progress or how they're doing on some major projects. The company they hired gave a presentation on how their new system was going to operate, how it was going to work. Afterwards, the employees got a chance to answer questions. “Afterwards” means after that time, the time after something else. For example, “I took my wife to a movie” …(be)cause I'm a good

 husband…“I took my wife to a movie. Afterwards, we went and had a nice dinner.” In the time after the movie, we had a nice dinner.

Well, the dialogue part of our story begins with Cecilia, who is the representative, the person from the outside firm, who's giving the presentation. She's now going to take some questions. “To take questions” means to answer questions, to let people ask you questions. Usually, we use that expression if you are standing in front of a group of 3 or 4 or 500 people, however many people are in your presentation, you can take questions.  So she decides to take some questions. She says, “So, in a nutshell, those are the features of our new system.” “In a nutshell,” and “nutshell” is all one word, a nutshell is the shell or the case, what a nut is in.  For example, a walnut, an almond, pecans - these are all nuts that you can eat, a type of food, and they come in a little case - but we call that case a shell. Peanuts, for example, come in a peanut shell. It's the outside of the peanut that holds it in. Well, a nutshell is, of course, the shell of any nut; but the expression means because a nutshell is a small place, there's not very much inside a nutshell.  The expression “in a nutshell” means to summa rize, to give you a very short, small, if you will, version or small explanation of what it is. It's when you want to tell someone the main idea in a very shortened or very summa ry-like manner. So, Cecilia says, “In a nutshell, those are the features of our new system. Any questions?”

Well, the first question comes from Yuri, and he says, “Yes, I have a question. From your description, it sounds like the new system may be difficult to use.” “From your description,” from what you have said, “it sounds like,” means it appears to me, it seems that, “it may be difficult to use.” Now, notice that Yuri is asking a question which is something of a criticism. He's saying, well, I think your system may be difficult to use. But he wants to ask it politely, and in American business culture, especially, it's very important to be polite, to not criticize or attack someone openly. That is, you want to make sure that you are asking a question in a way that is respectful of the other person. So, you do not want to say, “I have a question. Why is this so difficult to use?” or “I think this is going to be too difficult to use.” Instead, Yuri says, “From your description, it sounds like the system may be difficult to use.” In other words, that's what I think - that's the appearance, but maybe I'm wrong - is the idea. He then says to Cecilia, “Can you speak to that?” “Can you speak to that” means “Can you talk about that?” And that's an expression you would use in a formal situation, usually, when you are asking a presenter, someone who is presenting to a group of people, to answer a question. You wouldn't say it probably if you were just talking to one other

 person; you would say it when you are asking a question of someone who is presenting to a group.

Well, Cecilia says, “I understand your concern, but actually, the system is very simple to use.” “I understand your concern” is a polite way of saying, I'm listening to you; I understand what you're saying, but you're wrong. But, you see, you can't say, “Oh no, you're wrong.” We want to first say, “Oh yes, I understand your concern.” You're saying to that person that they have a good reason to say what they are saying, but actually, meaning the truth is, the system is easy to use; it's very simple to use. So, “I understand your concern” is a good expression to know when you are answering a question that you disagree with or you want to tell someone that they're wrong. First, you want to say, I understand your concern; I understand what you're worried about, but actually, it's the opposite.

Cecilia says she mentioned a lot of features, but the typical or the average employee won't be using more than two or three features. And a “feature” is a part of the program. They won't be using more than two or three parts on a daily basis. “Daily,” you probably know, means everyday. So, she could have said more than two or three times daily, but there's a little more formal expression that they use in business more, called “on a daily basis” - means everyday; “basis” on a daily basis.  You could also say on a weekly basis or on a monthly basis, on a yearly basis. It just means every month, or every year, or every week.

Alessandro asks a question. He says, “Well, my biggest concern is that all of the employees  will have access to the system.” “My biggest concern” means what I am worried about most. It's a little more direct, but still, it's a polite way of saying I’m worried about something, I have a problem with this. My biggest, my most important, my main, my principle concern - all those mean the same - is that all of the employees will have access to the system. They'll be able to get in to this new computer system. Alessandro says, “How does this affect my projects that have sensitive information?” How does this “affect,” you're saying, what is the impact on or how is this going to influence the things that I am doing. And his concern is that his projects have sensitive information. When we say you have “sensitive information” means that it's secret information. It's information that you do not want everyone to know. Usually, it's a word that we use for a business or the government. The government has sensitive information about the Center for Educational Development, secret information. I hope not...uh…but, that's the meaning of sensitive here. It means information that you want to keep as secret.

 Cecilia answers this question by saying, “That's a good question.” Again, that's a very commo n way in an American business meeting to say to the person, “Oh yes, I understand what you're saying.” Thank you for asking that question, that's a good question. She's complimenting, she's saying something nice to the person who's asking the question. That's especially important when people ask questions that are difficult, or that you need to disagree with them about. So, she says, “That's a good question. One of the key features of the program is that it allows the project manager to limit access.” One of the “key” features means one of the main features, one of the most important features or parts of our program, is that is allows or permits the project manager to limit, to restrict, to make less people able to access, to limit access, for any of his or her projects. Notice she says, “his or her.” It's commo n now in American English to use both the masculine and feminine forms of the pronoun or when we say his or her; that, of course, would be the possessive adjective. So, that is a way of saying, well, if it's a man or a woman, I don't want to  assume it's a man or assume, or guess that it's a woman. It's something of a change in English over the last 20-25 years or so. People used to just use the masculine. If you didn't know, you would say his or him for an object pronoun. But, now we often use his or her, him or her.

Cecilia says, “If there are no other questions, thank you for coming...” “If there are no other questions” is the way that you end a presentation. If you've been answering questions, you are telling the people, if you have a question, ask me right away because I'm going to stop answering questions now. So she says, “If there are no other questions,” and sometimes when people say that, someone will say, “Oh, I have a question,” “Before you stop, I want to ask a question.” So, that's giving them the opportunity to do that. She says, “If there are no other questions, thank you for coming and we look forward to working with you in the future.” “We look forward to” - we are waiting to, we think it will be good for us to work together in the future.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

<start of story> Our company hired an outside firm to set up a computer system, to help us keep track of the progress on major projects. The company gave us a presentation on how the new system worked. Afterwards, the employees got a chance to ask questions.

 Cecilia: So, in a nutshell, those are the features of the new system. Any questions?

Yuri: Yes, I have a question. From your description, it sounds like the new system may be difficult to use. Can you speak to that?

# Legal Problems

complete transcript of this podcast by becoming a member of ESL Podcast at eslpod.com.

Now let's get started!

<start of story> I was reading the newspaper this morning and saw a story about a university student arrested and charged with burglary and assault. Last Monday, this student hit a security guard over the head, broke into his professor's office and stole the professor's computer. He wasn't doing well in the class and thought that he could steal the exam.

When he was arraigned in court, the prosecutor said that the charges were very serious felonies, and not simple misdemeanors. He also said that because the student was a flight risk, the bail should be set at $2 million dollars. The judge agreed. If the student is found guilty of all the charges, he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in jail.

When I read this story, I thought, wouldn't it have been easier for him to just study? <end of story>

This podcast is about "Legal Problems.” "Legal" is connected or related to law. So, if you have legal problems, you have some problems with the police or the government. In this story, I say that I was reading the newspaper and I saw a story about a university student who was arrested and charged. To be "arrested,” the past tense, to be arrested is to be caught by the police. The police come and

ESL Podcast 172 - Legal Problems

 take you to jail. They catch you doing something wrong. To be "charged,” also past tense – “The student was arrested and the student was charged.” To be charged means that the police say that you are guilty of a certain crime; that you did something wrong. And you actually go to the court to a judge, and they are going to, at that point, begin a case against you. They are going to give you, usually, a trial. A "trial" is when you have a judge, and sometimes you have people who decide - a group of people. That group is called a "jury.” So, you have a judge and a jury, a group of people who decide if you are guilty or not guilty. To be charged, then, means that the police are formally and officially saying that you've committed or you did something wrong; you've committed a crime. We use that verb "to commit" when we are talking about a crime, something against the law. So, this student is first arrested and then the police charge him. They say yes, you did something wrong.

Now, what he did wrong in this story is burglary and assault. "Burglary" is when you steal something from someone else. Usually, it's a case where you go into someone's house or in someone's office and you take something that isn't yours. That is burglary. It's the same as "theft.” Theft, burglary, are basically the same here. An "assault" is when you hit someone; when you either hit them with your fist or you hit them with something else and you hurt or injure someone else. That's called assault.

So, this poor student has been arrested. He's been charged with the crimes of burglary and assault. The story says that last Monday, this student hit a security guard over the head. A "security guard" is someone who watches a building and makes sure that no one does anything wrong, no one enters the building without permission. Security guards are not the police. They're usually not policemen or policewomen, but they are people who companies hire to protect their property. And, there are lots of different companies in the United States that have security guards. A "guard,” of course, is someone who watches someone else. You could have, for example, a “prison guard” - someone who is actually a government employee and watches prisoners in jail. But a security guard is usually a private, non-government employee of a company that is there to make sure nothing happens to their property.

Well, the student hit the security guard over the head. To hit someone “over the head" means to hit them on the head, it's the same meaning. You're basically taking something and hitting their head and hurting them. Well, he hit the security guard over the head, and broke into his professor's office. To "break into" means

ESL Podcast 172 - Legal Problems

 that you go into something, an office or a house, without permission, that you're not supposed to be there. So, you climb through the window or you hit the door very hard and bust it down, we would say, to take the door and hit it very hard in order to open it. Or you could, if you were a little more intelligent, you could pick the lock. To "pick" means to open a lock without the key. I'm giving you lots of good ideas here about how to steal something. Okay.

So, we break into the professor’s office, well he, in the past tense, "broke into,” - “broke” is the past of “break” - so he broke into the professor's office, he went in the professor's office without permission, and he stole the professor's computer. "Stole" is the past tense of the verb to "steal,” which means to take something without permission, to take something from someone else. Well, this student is not, or was not doing very well in that professor's class, and he thought if he stole the computer, he could steal the exam. So, he isn't a good student, but perhaps, he's not stupid, either. Well, unfortunately, he was arrested and the police charged him, and then they took him to the judge. They took him to court.

And when the police take you to the court, before a judge, the first step in your legal prosecution, that is, when the government says that you did something wrong, they prosecute you. To "prosecute" means the government tries to convince the judge or the judge and the jurors that you are guilty. So, the first step the government does is they arraign you in court. And to "arraign" means you go in front of the judge and you have to say whether you are guilty or innocent. Did you do the crime or did you not do the crime? Well, you have to tell the judge what your opinion is, what you think happened. And this is called "entering a plea.” “To enter a plea" means to tell the judge if you are guilty or not guilty. Now, of course, most people say they are not guilty, they did not commit or do the crime.

So, this student was arraigned in court and the "prosecutor" – and a “prosecutor” is the person who prosecutes the case; the government lawyer who is responsible for proving to the court that you are guilty – this prosecutor said that the charges were very serious felonies, and not simple misdemeanors. Well the “charges” are the accusations; they are what the government says the police say that you did wrong. A "felony" is a serious crime – murder, certain kinds of burglary, burning someone's house down, anything that's very serious would be a felony. A less serious crime is called a "misdemeanor,” and “misdemeanor” means that you didn't commit a serious crime. Maybe you crossed the street illegally or you were smoking and you threw your cigarette out the window. Well

ESL Podcast 172 - Legal Problems

 that's a misdemeanor, that's polluting. I hate when people do that. But, nobody gets arrested for that. They'll probably just give you a fine; you'll have to pay some money. So, a misdemeanor is a small crime, not a serious crime.

The prosecutor in our story says that the student committed serious felonies, not simple misdemeanors. Notice the use of "serious" there to emphasize that it is a big crime, it is a crime that the court has to treat very seriously. Also, we say "simple" misdemeanor; meaning, simple here, means not very serious, not very important.

Well this prosecutor said that the student was a "flight risk” (two words) - means that the person may try to leave the city, the state, or even the country if they are not put in prison right away or if they don't pay a lot of money as part of their bail. "Bail" is money that you give the government; it's sort of like insurance money that says that you will not try to leave the state or leave the country before the government puts you on trial. That is, you're arrested, say, in March, well, let's call it May, 2006, and you are arraigned, you say you're not guilty. The government then says, ok, well, you come back in September and we will have a trial, we will see if you are guilty or not guilty. But, between May and September, for example, we won't keep you in prison. Instead, you can put up bail or post bail. And that means that you are going to give us some money that is part of our insurance policy that you are going to come back. And if you don't come back, then, you will owe all this money. It's kind of a strange system, but it is, in fact, the system that most American courts use with criminals. Unless it's a very, very serious criminal, in which case, the judge says there is no bail, the person has to stay in prison until the trial; they can't go home.

Well, in this case, the judge is asked by the prosecutor to make the bail very high, a large amount. He asks that the bail be "set" at $2 million. Meaning, the judge will say, this is how much you have to pay in bail. Now, actually, you don't have to pay $2 million. Usually, there are companies, what are called bail bonds companies or bail bond companies…bond, where you can say, I will give you 10% of the $2 million. And the company will guarantee the government the rest of the money. It's again kind of a weird system we have, but setting the bail is when the judge says you have to pay this amount of money and we'll give you that money back if you come back in September, for example, for your trial. Well, the judge agrees with the prosecutor and sets the bail very hard, very high.

ESL Podcast 172 - Legal Problems

 The student is in serious trouble, of course. If he is found guilty of all the charges, he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in jail. To be "found guilty" means that the judge or the judge and the jury, that group of people that usually decide whether you are guilty or innocent, decide that you are guilty, that you committed or did the crime. If this student is found guilty, he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in jail.

To be "sentenced" means that you have to spend time in jail. Now, "sentencing" is a punishment. So, when the judge sentences you, he is giving you your punishment. Sometimes your punishment is money, is a fine that you have to pay. You have to pay the government a thousand dollars for smoking in a place where you shouldn't be smoking, for example. Or your sentence could be that you have to go to jail. So, a sentence, as a noun, can be a punishment, either a serious punishment or a not serious punishment. As a verb, to be sentenced, means that the government, the judge, usually, says that you have to be punished either by paying money or by going to jail, going to prison. This particular student could be sentenced up to 15 years. When we use "up to,” we mean it could be 15, it could be 14, it could be 10, anything that is 15 or less years. The maximum, in other words, would be 15 years.

Well, our story ends by me wondering why the student didn't just study for his exam, instead of trying to steal the professor's computer. Wouldn't that be less work?

Now let's listen to the story this time at a native rate of speech.

<start of story> I was reading the newspaper this morning and saw a story about a university student arrested and charged with burglary and assault. Last Monday, this student hit a security guard over the head, broke into his professor's office and stole the professor's computer.

Today's podcast is going to be about buying souvenirs. Let's get started.

<start of story> I was vacationing in Miami, Florida, and I went to a souvenir store to get some gifts for friends back home.

Lydia:  Could you show me where the T-shirts are?

Clerk:  Sure, they're on the left, along the wall. Can I help you find something?

Lydia:  I'd like to get a T-shirt, but I'm not sure about the size. It's for a friend who's about your size.

Clerk:  Well, in that case, you'll need a large. I only have these in medium or small, but I have these two in size large.

Lydia:  Do you have anything in another color or another style?

Clerk:  How about this one?

Lydia:  That's great. Could you also recomme nd a gift for a young woman?

Clerk:  We have a lot of locally-made items. I don't think you want a mug, a key chain, or a snow globe. But, how about some jewelry?

Lydia:  Oh, this bracelet is nice! How much is it?

ESL Podcast 173 - Buying Souvenirs

 Clerk:  It's on sale for $36.00.

Lydia:  Okay, I'll take the T-shirt and the necklace. Do you have a box for the necklace?

Clerk: Sure, no problem. That will be $59.60 with tax.

Lydia: There you go.

Clerk: Here's your change. Thanks for coming in. <end of story>

This podcast is called, “Buying Souvenirs.” And a “souvenir” is something that you buy when you go on vacation. You take a trip to somewhere else, and you want something to remember that place that you visited; something you can take back home with you. It may be a picture, lots of different things that have the name of the place you visited. All of these could be souvenirs.

Well, in this story, Lydia is vacationing in Florida. Notice that the word “vacation” is a noun. It means what they would call in Britain a “holiday.” And a vacation or a holiday is when you don't work and you go somewhere else to relax or see something. It can also be a verb: “to vacation.” So, “I am vacationing,” “I was vacationing,” is also a possible use of that word. Well, she's vacationing in Miami, Florida. Florida, as you may know, is located in the southern part of the United States, the southeastern part. It's famous for Disneyland, or, I’m sorry, Disneyworld in Orlando. Disneyland is here in southern California. But, Miami is very famous for being a very nice place to take a vacation.

So, she's vacationing in Miami and she goes into a souvenir store. Of course, a souvenir store would be a store that sells things that have the name or the picture of the place where you're visiting. And if you go to somewhere that has a lot of tourists - a lot of people who are visiting or vacationing - you will find a souvenir store. Well, she wants to get some souvenirs, some gifts, for friends back home. She asks the clerk in the store if he could show her where the T- shirts are.

A “T-shirt” is a piece of what we would call casual clothing. “Casual” is the opposite of formal. We don't normally say “informal” clothes; we would say casual

ESL Podcast 173 - Buying Souvenirs

 clothes. And a T-shirt is a piece of casual clothing. You can wear a T-shirt underneath a formal shirt. And usually, when a man does that, it's a white T-shirt. A T-shirt is usually short-sleeved. That is, the “sleeve,” which is the part of the shirt that is on your arm, that sleeve is not long; it doesn't go to your hand, to your wrist, but it stops in the upper part of your arm. And we call that a “short- sleeved shirt.” Well, a T-shirt is a short-sleeved shirt, a casual shirt. It's very popular in many souvenir stores to find shirts that have the name of the town or the place where you're visiting. My brother, Mark, used to own a lot of T-shirts that had names of places where he had visited. And then he got married and his wife made him throw them all away. So, because they're very casual clothing and you wouldn't want to wear them to a formal event.

But anyway, the person here in our story, Lydia, has T-shirts that she wants to buy. The clerk shows her where they are and asks Lydia, “Can I help you find something?” – is a common question that a person in a store will ask you when you walk in. “Hi! Can I help you?” “Can I help you find something?” And if you want their help, of course, you can say, “Yes. I'm looking for a T-shirt.” “I'm looking for a camera.” “I'm looking for a girlfriend.” - whatever you're going to get. The clerk will, of course, try to help you and their job is to sell you something.

Sometimes, you don't want any help and in that case, you say, “I'm just looking.” So, a clerk says, “Can I help you find something?” You say, “No, thank you. I'm just looking.” We can also say, “I'm just browsing.” To “browse” means to look at things, but not looking for anything specific, necessarily; just sort of looking at different items in the store. Of course, the word “browser” is what you use on your Internet connection on your computer to look at the Worldwide Web. You are browsing the web; you are looking around at different things.

Well, the clerk here tells Lydia where the T-shirts are, and Lydia says, “I'd like to get a T-shirt, but I'm not sure about the size. It's for a friend who is about your size.” Well, “size” is how big or how small a piece of clothing is. And when someone says, “Oh, this is about your size,” means that it is the same size shirt or pants that you wear. So, someone says, “Oh, he's my size” means he’s basically the same height and weight as I am and wears a similar size clothing. Brad Pitt is my size, for example. He and I look alike and we have similar sizes in our clothing.

Well, the clerk says, “I wear a large.” A “large,” is of course, one of the sizes; it's the bigger size. We have large for bigger people, medium, and then small. We

ESL Podcast 173 - Buying Souvenirs

 also have extra-large for people who are even bigger than normal. And you even can find extra, extra-large. On a piece of clothing, you would normally see these as letters, so a large would be an “L,” and a medium would be an “M,”  and a small would be an “S,” an extra-large would be an “XL,” an extra, extra-large would be an “XXL,” and so forth. Lydia says that she wants to see if the clerk has anything in another color or another style. And a “style” is the look of the piece of clothing. It might, for example, be a pair of pants that has lots of pockets. That could be one style. And a different style could be a pair of pants that had no pockets. So, a style is the way that a piece of clothing looks, in this case. The clerk suggests another T-shirt to Lydia and she says, “That's great,” meaning yes, that's the one I want. “Could you also recommend a gift for a young woman?” “Could you also recomme nd...” is a polite way of saying, “Can you give me your idea? Can you give me your opinion? Can you give me a recomme ndation for a gift?” The clerk says, “We have lots of locally-made items.” “Local” means in the area where you are. So, here in Los Angeles, locally, we have lots of movie stars and we have lots of singers and artists. That's what we have here in this area - locally. So, “locally” describes things in an area. If we say something is “locally-made,” we mean that it is made in that area. So, if you go to visit Tokyo and someone says, “Well, this is locally-made,” it means it's made in Tokyo. Or if you go to Nairobi and they say, “Yes, this is locally made,” they mean it's made in Nairobi, Kenya. That is a use of that expression.

So Lydia is asking for a recomme ndation and the clerk says, “I don't think you want a mug, a keychain, or a snow globe.” These are three very commo n items, very commo n things you will find in a souvenir store that have the name of the place on them. A “mug” is a cup, usually like a coffee cup. So, if you go on to eslpod.com, our website, and you look at the little picture we have for the English Café, you will see a mug of coffee, a cup of coffee. So, a mug is a big cup that you drink coffee or tea in. Right now, for example, I have a mug of hot tea. I like Chai tea, a spiced tea, in front of me. And I drink that so that I can keep my voice here, like that. Well, that's a mug of tea.

A “key chain,” two words, is what you have your keys on, what you keep your keys on. In many places, you can buy key chains that have the name of the place. So, it's a little ring that you put your keys on; that's a key chain.

A “snow globe” – two words, “snow,” like snow that falls during the winter time where it's cold, and a “globe,” a globe is usually a representation of the world, of the entire earth; and it's something that you can look at where different countries

ESL Podcast 173 - Buying Souvenirs

 are. But here, a globe just means a round-like piece of glass that inside has a little picture or representation of the place you are visiting. So, for example, if you go to Sydney, Australia and you bought a snow globe, inside of the globe, which is only a couple of inches tall, you would see a little model, a little representation of the Sydney Opera House. And that would be inside this snow globe. Inside the snow globe there's water. And there's also little white pieces of...it's almost like white pieces of sand, so that if you take the snow globe and you shake it, you move it up and down. The sand will start falling from the top like it is snow, as if it were snow. And that's a snow globe. You may have seen one of these; they’re very popular, at least in American tourist stores. So, it's sort of a joke gift now because people don't normally buy them anymore. But, many places still sell them. And it is a very popular item in a souvenir store. Well, that's a snow globe.

The clerk says, instead, “How about some jewelry?” That expression “How about...” means “why don't you buy” or “why don't you consider this idea.”  “How about some jewelry?” means “why don't you think about buying some jewelry?” “Jewelry” is things like rings and pendants and earrings - things that you wear on your body. Women often wear jewelry, for example. Well, the clerk says, “How about some jewelry?” And Lydia says, “Oh, this bracelet is nice.“  A “bracelet” is something that goes around your wrist, at the end of your arm, between your arm and your hand - we call that your “wrist.” And that is a place where women and men sometimes put a bracelet. So it goes around it.

Lydia says, “How much is it?,” meaning “how much does it cost?” And the clerk says it's 36 dollars. And Lydia says, “36 dollars! That's outrageous. That's too much.” No, she doesn't say that. She actually says, “Okay, I'll take the T-shirt and the bracelet.” When you say in a store, “I'll take it,” that means, “I will buy it.” “I would like to buy it.” “I am going to buy it.” She asks the clerk if he has a box. A box here would be something that you would use to put it in and put paper around it, we would say to “wrap” it, if you are going to give it to someone as a gift. So, she asks for a box. Many stores that sell gifts will also give you a little box, if you ask them. You have to ask them, however.

The clerk says, “Sure, no problem. That will be $59.60 with tax.” Lydia says, “There you go.” What she's doing at that point is she's giving the clerk money or her credit card. And that expression is something we use when we're handing something or giving something to someone else. “Well, here you go” or “there you go” - either way, it's when you're giving the money to the clerk, the person who works at the store. The clerk says, “Here's your change.” “Change” is the

ESL Podcast 173 - Buying Souvenirs

 money you get back from the money you give to the clerk. So, if it's $59.60, and you give the clerk 60 dollars, your change is 40 cents. So, “change” is the money you get back from what you are buying. The clerk finally says, “Thanks for coming in.” “To come in” here means to visit, to go to. So, “Thanks for coming in.”

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

<start of story> I was vacationing in Miami, Florida, and I went to a souvenir store to get some gifts for friends back home.

Lydia:  Could you show me where the T-shirts are?

Clerk:  Sure, they're on the left, along the wall. Can I help you find something?

Lydia:  I'd like to get a T-shirt, but I'm not sure about the size. It's for a friend who's about your size.

Clerk:  Well, in that case, you'll need a large. I only have these in medium or small, but I have these two in size large.

Lydia:  Do you have anything in another color or another style?

Clerk:  How about this one?

Lydia:  That's great. Could you also recomme nd a gift for a young woman?

Clerk:  We have a lot of locally-made items. I don't think you want a mug, a key chain, or a snow globe. But, how about some jewelry?

Lydia:  Oh, this bracelet is nice! How much is it?

Clerk:  It's on sale for $36.00.

Lydia:  Okay, I'll take the T-shirt and the necklace. Do you have a box for the necklace?

Clerk: Sure, no problem. That will be $59.60 with tax.

 Lydia: There you go.

Clerk: Here's your change. Thanks for coming in. <end of story>

# A Potluck

complete transcript of our podcast, definitions, additional vocabulary, additional sample sentences, culture notes, and more.  So, go to our website at www.eslpod.com for more information.

Today's podcast is about a potluck dinner. Let's eat! > Mike:  Thanks a lot for agreeing to help me plan the block party.
> Susan:  Oh, I'm happy to help.  I'm surprised you didn't ask Bree.  She's so good at planning parties.
> Mike:  I thought about it, but I was afraid she would turn it into a cocktail party or something.
> Susan: Yeah, I see what you mean. Well, I made a guest list to see how many people may be attending. We can put the invitations in their mailboxes this weekend.  It will be a potluck, so I'm asking people to RSVP and to let me know what they plan to bring.
> Mike:  What kind of things do we need?
> Susan: Well, I'm asking people to bring a main dish, chips and dip, or dessert. It won't be a BYO B like last year, so Lynette and Edie are bringing some soda. I can supply the paper plates and cups, and the plastic utensils.
> Mike:  That's great. It sounds like you have everything under control.
> Susan: I really can't believe it. There's a first time for everything.

 Today's podcast is about a potluck. A “potluck,” all one word, is a party or a dinner where everyone brings something different. So, instead of one person cooking all the food, each person that goes to the party brings, we would say, brings a dish, that is brings some food for other people in the party to eat. So, that's a potluck dinner or a potluck party.

Well, this is a block party that we heard about in today's dialogue. A “block party,” two words, is a party where people who live in the same area, on the same block have a picnic or a dinner.  We would say they have a get together, a get together. A “get together” is a noun which means a meeting when people come together for a party informally. Well, a block party is for people who live in the same area. A block you may know is the space between two streets, and most blocks in the United States are square so there's a street on each side, and the houses of course are on each side of the street. Well, a block party is usually neighbors that get together usually - maybe 10, maybe 15 houses, families, will come together for a party. Sometimes the block party is even bigger for some neighborhoods.

Well, Mike starts the dialogue by saying to Susan, “Thanks a lot for agreeing to help me plan the block party.”  And Susan says, ”Oh, I’m happy to help.”  I’m, it’s my pleasure, I, I like helping.  She says, "I’m surprised you didn’t ask Bree. She’s so good at planning parties."  “I’m surprised you didn’t ask.”  “I’m surprised that you didn’t ask” - means the same thing.  In English, we sometimes don’t put a “that” in between the two parts or clauses of the sentence. So Susan says, “I’m surprised you didn’t ask Bree” - another neighbor.  “She’s so good at planning parties.”  Mike says, “I thought about it, but I was afraid she would turn it into a cocktail party or something.”  The expression “to turn into” means to change something.  So, in this case, Mike wants an informal party but he’s afraid that if he asked Bree to help him she would change it, she would turn the party into a cocktail party. A “cocktail,” all one word. A cocktail party is a party that is more formal. A cocktail. as a noun. is a drink, an alcoholic drink. So, someone who has a cocktail party is having a more formal type of party, and block parties are always informal. So, that’s why Mike didn’t want to ask Bree to help him.

Susan says, “Yeah I see what you mean,” I understand what you are saying. “I see what you mean.” “Well, I made a guest list to see how many people may be attending.”  A “guest list,” two words, is, of course, a list of names of the people who will be guests at the party. Your guest is the person or people who are

 coming to your house or to your party. Well, she, Susan made a guest list because she wanted to know how many people were going to be there or were going to be attending. “To attend” as a verb means to go somewhere, to be part of something, to join a meeting. Or, “to go to a dinner” is to attend the dinner. You can attend the sporting game. You can attend the World Cup soccer match. Those, anything that’s an event, anything that’s a meeting or organization, group of people. You can use this verb “to attend.”

Well, Susan goes on to say that, “We can put the invitations in their mailboxes this weekend.” And, an invitation is a piece of paper that says to the person "you are invited to our party."  “Invitation” comes from the verb “to invite,” to ask someone, to come to your event, or your party.  Susan is suggesting that they put these invitations in the mailboxes, the place where you get your mail outside of your house or your apartment. She says, “It will be a potluck, so I’m asking people to RSVP and to let me know what they plan to bring.”  Well, we already know a potluck is a dinner, a party where everyone brings something to eat but, of course, you don’t want everyone bringing the same thing. So, usually when you have a potluck dinner or a potluck party, you ask people what they are going to bring so you can tell them if we already have too many people bringing potato chips, or too many people bringing salad or pizza, or whatever it is.

Susan is going to ask people to RSVP.  "RSVP"  we use as verb. It actually is a, a French phrase. RSVP stands for, “Respondez, s'il vous plait.”  I apologize, my French is, is terrible but when someone says I’m going to ask people to RSVP, they mean, you, they’re going to ask them to call or to e-mail and let them know if they are going to go or not. So, many invitations, especially more formal invitations but even for informal parties, it will often say at the bottom of the piece of paper of the invitation, “please RSVP to Susan,” and gives Susan’s telephone number, or I guess nowadays we would give an email address or maybe a, a, a Skyp e address, I’m not sure.

Well, Mike says, “What kind of things do we need?,” what do we need to ask people to bring to our party? And, Susan says that they need to bring a lot of beer. No, no she doesn’t say that. Susan says, "Well, I’m asking people to bring a main dish, chips and dip, or dessert." A “main dish” is food that is for the main part, or main course of the meal. Different parts of the meal are called “courses.” So, a main dish would be the main thing that you are going to be eating at the potluck party. “Chips and dip” are potato chips, for example, and dip is what you put the potato chip into. You can also have corn chips and salsa - very popular in

 the United States, especially in California, to have a tomato salsa, which is a tomato dip.  And, people also have here guacamole, and “guacamole” is, like salsa, a Spanish food from Latin America and it is…uses avocados, the fruit, the green fruit avocado, and that is another type of dip. So, lots of possibilities, different types of potato chips and dip, and corn chips. Dessert is what you eat after the meal, usually something sweet.

Susan says that, “It won’t be a BYO B like last year.”  It won’t be a BYO B. “BYOB” stands for “bring your own bottle,” and bottle usually means a bottle of alcohol or a bottle of wine. So, BYO B means that you have to bring what you want to drink. Usually, people have soda, and soda, also called soda pop, is things like Coca- Cola and Pepsi and 7-Up. Those are all types of soda. So, this is not a BYO B, and if it is a BYO B, it will say on the invitation, “BYO B” and everyone knows that means they have to bring their own alcohol, usually, but at least their own drinks. So, Susan says it won’t be that way.

"So Lynette and Edie are bringing some soda. I can supply the paper plates and cups,” Susan says. “To supply,” in this case means “I can bring,” I can bring those things for the rest of the group. Usually, we use that verb "to supply" when we’re talking about a lot of people, a large group of people. She says, “I can supply the paper plates.”  “Plates,” you know, is what you eat off of. “Paper plates” are plates made of, let’s see, paper. “Cups” are, of course, what you drink out of, and there are paper cups you can buy.  Very popular at parties, especially informal parties, for people to have paper plates and paper cups so that nobody has to wash the dishes later. They also have plastic utensils. “Utensils” are the knives, the forks, and the spoons.  The things that you eat with are called utensils. Plastic utensils are knives, forks, and spoons that are made out of plastic, and so you can throw them away at the end of the party.

Mike says, “That’s great. It sounds like you have everything under control.”  The expression “to have everything under control” means that you have everything taken care of. You have thought of everything and everything is going well. Someone says to you, “You have everything under control, don’t you?”  And you say, “Of course, I do.”  Susan says, “I really can’t believe it. There’s a first time for everything.”  When she says "I really can’t believe it,” she means that she can’t believe that she has everything under control. Everything has been planned and taken care of. She then makes a joke about herself. “There’s a first time for everything,” meaning that even if it has not happened in the past, it could happen

 in the future. And that is what she has going on for her. She has everything for the first time under control.

Now, let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech. > Mike:  Thanks a lot for agreeing to help me plan the block party.
> Susan:  Oh, I'm happy to help.  I'm surprised you didn't ask Bree.  She's so good at planning parties.
> Mike:  I thought about it, but I was afraid she would turn it into a cocktail party or something.
> Susan: Yeah, I see what you mean. Well, I made a guest list to see how many people may be attending. We can put the invitations in their mailboxes this weekend.  It will be a potluck, so I'm asking people to RSVP and to let me know what they plan to bring.
> Mike:  What kind of things do we need?
> Susan: Well, I'm asking people to bring a main dish, chips and dip, or dessert. It won't be a BYO B like last year, so Lynette and Edie are bringing some soda. I can supply the paper plates and cups, and the plastic utensils.
> Mike:  That's great. It sounds like you have everything under control.
> Susan: I really can't believe it. There's a first time for everything.

# Time Off from Work

complete transcript, definitions, sample sentences, additional cultural information - everything you want in the Learning Guide.  Today's podcast is called, "Time Off from Work." Let's get started. > My buddy from college, Jack, was getting married and our friend Rob was planning a bachelor party for him in Vegas. It was going to be the last weekend of the month and I wanted to go. The trouble was, I was scheduled to work that weekend. I needed to get the time off from work or I was going to miss out on all the fun.
> I have some vacation leave, but company policy requires that my boss sign off on any leave we take. I've heard of companies doing that for longer periods of leave - like maternity leave or a leave of absence - but our company does that even for vacation leave. I thought about just calling in sick that weekend - I do have a lot of accumulated sick leave - but I didn't think my boss would appreciate me leaving him hanging.
> In the end I just asked him straight out and to my surprise he said, "okay." Now, I just need to get ready for a wild weekend with the guys. I can't wait.

This podcast is called, "Time Off From Work." Time off from work is when you don't have to work. Someone says, "I want some time off" or, "I want some time off from work" - means they want to take a vacation or have a break from work or from whatever it is that you normally do. Some of you sleep all day, so you would take time off from being lazy. No, I'm just kidding.

 My buddy from college, the story begins, was getting married and our friend was planning a bachelor party for him in Vegas. Well "my buddy," is an informal term for my friend. Sometimes we even say, "my bud." Usually when we're joking we'll say, "my bud Jerry,” “my friend Jerry,” “my buddy Jerry."

Well, my buddy's name is Jack and he was getting married and our friend Rob wanted to have a bachelor party for him. The word “bachelor” means the person who is getting married. The man who is getting married is called the bachelor, or an unmarried man, anyone who is not married who is a man can be called a bachelor. A woman is called a “bachelorette;” that word is not as commo n as the word bachelor. So, you can say, "Oh yes, I'm a bachelor” - means, "I'm not married."

Well, a bachelor party in this case is a party for a bachelor, who is going to get married. And, traditionally there is a party, usually with just the men, the male friends of the bachelor, who will be called when he gets married, "the groom," is the man who is getting married. The woman is called the “bride.”

Well, in this bachelor party, usually it’s a few days before the actual wedding. The idea is that it is the last chance for a man to have fun before he gets married. So, if you are going to get married you must have a bachelor party because once you get married, well it's all over. The bachelor party, then, is going to be in Vegas. And, Vegas stands for "Las Vegas" which is spelled “Las” although we usually pronounce it "Los" like an "o." So, Las Vegas, is in Nevada. And, it is famous, you may know, as the gambling center of the United States where people can gamble. They can play cards and other games and win money, usually lose money, at least I do. Well, Vegas is also famous because it is kind of a place to have a good time, to enjoy yourself. And, it’s located in the state of Nevada. It’s about five or six hours here from Los Angeles, driving. And, it’s usually very warm most of the year. So, Las Vegas is a fun place to visit, especially for adults.

Well, the bachelor party is going to be in Vegas, or Las Vegas. It was going to be the last weekend of the month. The last weekend of the month would be the last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of a month, the fourth week in most months, and I wanted to go. The trouble was, I was scheduled to work that weekend. Notice that expression: "The trouble was," and then we begin a sentence. You could say, "the trouble was THAT I had to work this weekend." They mean the same thing, but sometimes we use that expression "the trouble was," or "the problem is," or sometimes just "the thing is, I have to work that weekend." It’s a way of

 getting the attention of the other person. Usually we use that when we are going to say something that is a problem, that presents a problem to us, that we can't do something because of something else. So, that expression "the trouble was," I was scheduled, or I was supposed to, the plan was, I was to work that weekend. So, of course I needed to get time off from work. I needed a break, a vacation, from work. If I didn't, I was going to miss out on all the fun. “To miss out on" means that you will not be part of, you will not be able to participate in. We use that verb in a couple of different ways. Someone says, "Well, be sure not to be late for the dinner. Otherwise you will miss out on all the good food. You will miss out on the fun." You can even say, "Don't miss out," don't miss out on the good things that will happen. Well, here, I am worried that I'm going to miss out on all of the fun.

Well, I have some vacation leave. The word "leave," here means the same as a break, time that you don't have to work. There are different kinds of leave. One kind is vacation leave, when you are able to take time off of work to go on a vacation. Another kind of leave is a maternity leave. Maternity is when a woman is going to have a baby and she can get, in most companies, maternity leave. So, they give her maybe six weeks, two months, up to usually six months time, depends on how much the woman wants and how much they will give her. And, they will pay her salary, they will pay her for working but she has this time off to have her baby. There is also now, it’s less commo n, something called paternity leave. And “paternity” means the father gets time off from work to help with the new baby. So, you can get maternity leave and, in many places, you can also get paternity leave. The words maternity and paternity come from Latin words. "Mater-" means mother in Latin, that is where we get "maternity" from; and "pater-" in Latin means "father" and that is where we get "paternity leave" or "paternity," rather.

Well, in my company we have a policy that requires that my boss sign off on any leave we take. The expression "company policy" is one that you will hear a lot of in American businesses. Someone will say, "Well, you can't do that. Why? Well, it's company policy. You can't take your shirt off at work." I hope not. That is company policy. Well, the company policy in my company requires that my boss sign off on any leave. “To sign off on (something),” two words, means to approve, to say yes. Usually this is something that a boss or someone who is in charge will do. It could be something like a vacation request, as it is in this case. They could sign off on buying something new for the company - they approve it. Someone may even use this expression to say, "Are you going to sign off on this?" "No, I'm

 not going to sign off on that." And, that can also mean, "I don't agree with it. It’s not something that I believe in." But here it means to give permission. My boss has to give permission if I'm going to take any leave, any break, from work. I've heard of companies that require the boss sign off on something, like a leave, for longer periods of time. We gave two examples of a longer leave: a maternity leave, as I said before, is usually six weeks, often three months, or even six months. Vacation time is going to be much shorter. United States vacation time tends to be two to three weeks in most companies. That’s how much vacation leave you get each year.

Longer leaves are sometimes called, "a leave of absence." And, that’s when you take time off from work, but you normally don't get paid. So, you take time off from work and you don't get paid. Now, in maternity leave you often don't get paid either. I've said that companies will pay you, but sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. A leave of absence usually is when you take time for some personal reason, or some other reason that you don't want to quit your job but you need time off for something else. And so, you can take a leave of absence, perhaps to take care of your father or mother who is sick. Those would be possible reasons for a leave of absence. You want to make sure that you can watch all of the World Cup soccer games, so you take a month leave of absence.

In our company, however, we have to get approval even for something like vacation leave. I thought about just calling in sick that weekend. “To call in sick" means that you call your boss and you say, "Oh, I'm really sick. I can't go to work." And, sometimes of course people call in sick when they're not sick. You would never do that, but some people do that. So, calling in sick means that you are calling in and saying, "I can't work today. I'm too ill, I'm too sick. There is a football game on. No, I'm too sick." Well, I say here that I have a lot of accumulated sick leave. We've talked about vacation leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, leave of absence. Another kind of leave is sick leave, and sick leave you can guess is time…the number of days you get where you can still get paid and you can call in sick. Again, it depends on the company; sometimes it’s five days a year, sometimes it's ten days a year. Here at the Center for Educational Development, I think it's like 25 minutes, that's it. Well. in most companies you get more than 25 minutes to be sick, so you can accumulate your sick leave. To “accumulate” means something similar to save up, to save all of your sick leave. You can accumulate anything that is physical. You can accumulate paper, you could accumulate clothing, you can accumulate computers. The idea is that have a lot of them, you keep having more and more

 and more. Well, accumulated sick leave is when you don't use your sick leave, maybe from last year you didn't use any sick leave, and you had five days last year, and you have five days this year. Well, some companies will allow you to accumulate your sick leave, so now you can have ten days in one year because you didn't use your sick leave last year. That’s accumulated sick leave.

Well, I could have called in sick with my accumulated sick leave, but I didn't think my boss would appreciate me leaving him hanging. “To leave someone hanging," means that you abandon someone; you leave someone without any help. So, the person is expecting you to help them and you decide not to help them, not to go into work, for example. That would be to leave someone hanging. They’re not getting any help from you.

Well, I say that in the end, after all of this thinking about it, I decided just to ask him straight out. To ask someone "straight out," two words, straight out, means to ask them directly, to just ask them without any other sort of excuses or any other plans, to be direct with someone. "I'm going to ask you straight out. Did you talk to my girlfriend last night?" I'm asking you directly. And, you better say “no.” Well, my boss says, "Yes." He says okay. I can take my vacation leave. Now, I just need to get ready for a wild weekend with the guys.

A "wild" weekend would be a weekend, a Friday Saturday and Sunday that you would spend going to parties, in this case gambling in Las Vegas; that’s a wild weekend. The "guys" here means my men, my male friends, the men who are friends with me. The word "guys" can sometimes mean both men and women, boys and girls. You can say, "OK, you guys," especially with the word "you." "You guys" means informally, men and women. But, if you say "the guys" or "the girls," - "I'm going out with the guys tonight." - that means my male friends. No women, in that case. And, in a bachelor party, traditionally there are no women. Well, almost no women.

Now, let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech.

[start of story] My buddy from college, Jack, was getting married and our friend Rob was planning a bachelor party for him in Vegas. It was going to be the last weekend of the month and I wanted to go. The trouble was, I was scheduled to work that weekend. I needed to get the time off from work or I was going to miss out on all the fun.

 I have some vacation leave, but company policy requires that my boss sign off on any leave we take. I've heard of companies doing that for longer periods of leave - like maternity leave or a leave of absence - but our company does that even for vacation leave. I thought about just calling in sick that weekend - I do have a lot of accumulated sick leave - but I didn't think my boss would appreciate me leaving him hanging.

In the end I just asked him straight out and to my surprise he said, "okay." Now, I just need to get ready for a wild weekend with the guys. I can't wait. [end of story]

# A Wild Driver

# A Fight

complete transcript, as well as definitions, cultural notes, and other explanations that we don't talk about here on the podcast.

Today's podcast is called, "A Fight." Let's go. > Ginger:  I can't believe it.  You're late again!
> Fred:  I got caught up at work. What are you so worked up about?
> Ginger:  I've had it up to here with your excuses. If you knew you were going to be late, why didn't you call? We've been over this a hundred times.
> Fred:  There wasn't time to call. And plus, what's the big deal? I'm just a little late.
> Ginger:  A little late? You are an hour late. You are so inconsiderate sometimes…[sigh]…Yo u look tired.
> Fred:  Yeah, I am. Look, I'm late and I was inconsiderate. Let's not let it ruin our evening.
> Ginger:  Okay, I'm sorry. Maybe I overreacted. I know you've been really busy at work.
> Fred:  I'm the one who’s sorry. I should have called. Will you let me make it up to you?
> Ginger:  You don't have to. I shouldn't nag.
> We just listened to a fight between a husband and a wife. It was probably the shortest fight in the history of marriage, but not everything is real here on ESL podcast. The vocabulary and the expressions, however, are very real, very similar to what you might hear a husband and a wife say.

The story begins with Ginger saying, "I can't believe it. You're late again!" "I can't believe it" is something you say when you're very angry at something, when someone has disappointed you, has done something wrong. "I can't believe it." You're angry, you're mad at this person. And, Ginger is mad at Fred. Fred says, "I got caught up at work." To get "caught up" means that you got very busy, you got so busy that you didn't realize how late it was getting. Or, you had so much work that you had to stay longer than you expected. So, Fred says, “I got caught up at work.” There's also an expression "to get caught up IN something." "I got caught up in an argument with my boss and his supervisor" - means that you became a part of something, you got involved in something that you didn't necessarily want to be involved in. That's to "get caught up in." You can also get caught up in a novel, which means you really like the novel; you really are interested in it. "I got caught up in it and I read it throughout the night so I could finish it before morning." Those are different uses of "caught up" and "caught up in."

Well, he says, "I got caught up at work. What are you so worked up about?" To be "worked up" is another one of those two word verbs in English and it means to be angry, to be upset. When you get "worked up," you're getting angry, you're shouting, maybe your face is turning red. These are signs of someone who is getting worked up. Fred says to Ginger, "What are you so worked up about?” Why are you angry? And, Ginger says, "I've had it up to here with your excuses." "I've had it up to here" means I'm tired, I don't want to tolerate, I don’t want to put up with the situation anymore. I'm mad, I'm angry, and this is the last time I want this to happen. So, you may, for example, be talking to one of your fellow employees at work and you say, "I've had it up to here with that boss of ours. He's always yelling at us. I don't want to put up with or tolerate it anymore."

 Ginger says, "I've had it up to here with your excuses." And an "excuse" is a reason that you give someone that you did something wrong. Often it’s a reason that is supposed to convince the person that it wasn't really your fault or you had some reason, a good reason for doing what you did wrong. That's an excuse. Ginger says, "If you knew you were going to be home late, why didn't you call?" So, if you knew that you were busy, you should have called - that's the idea here. Why didn't you call? "We've been over this a hundred times." To "go over" something means to talk about it, to discuss it, to review it. In this case, Ginger says, "We've been over this a hundred times" - means this has happened before, again and again, and they've talked about it many times.

Fred says, "There wasn't time to call." “There wasn’t time to call.” Doesn't sound very convincing, does it? But, okay, that's Fred. "There wasn't time to call. And plus, what's the big deal?" Couple of expressions there. "And plus" means "in addition," when you want to say something else to someone. We use that a lot in a fight, in an argument with someone and you want to give them another reason why they are wrong, Or, you want to give them another reason why you are right. "And plus..." You can also use it in another, less argumentative, we might say, a less, a situation where you weren't arguing with someone. But here, it's used to try to answer the other person.

So, Fred says, "And plus, what's the big deal?" “What’s the big deal?” – means, what is the problem, why is this such a problem? The expression a "big deal" is when…can be used a couple of different ways. For example, someone who makes big deal of something else is someone who thinks it’s very important and considers it very important. The expression "to make a big deal of" is usually a negative one. Someone says, "Don't make a big deal about it.” Don't get so excited about it. Don't think it's so important." "A big deal" can also mean a large event. "I went to the Fourth of July parade and it was a big deal. They had a marching band and they had concerts and they had fireworks." This is a big deal; it’s a big event. Here, it means, "What's the problem? Why is it such a big problem?"

Ginger…Fred says, "I was just a little late." And, this really gets Ginger mad. She says, "A little late? You're an hour late. You are so inconsiderate sometimes." To be "inconsiderate," to be inconsiderate means that you don't think of other people, that you only think about yourself. We might say, "you're selfish." To be "selfish" means you only think about you. To be "inconsiderate" is to be "selfish." The opposite would be to be “considerate." To be "considerate" means you think

 about other people and other people's feelings. That's the same as to be "unselfish," to be considerate.

Well, here Ginger says that Fred is inconsiderate. And, Fred says that he is tired because Ginger says he looks tired. He says "Yeah, I am." "Look, I'm late, and I was inconsiderate." The expression there, "Look," you may know, is one that we use in English to get someone's attention, to get them to listen to you carefully. And here, what Fred is doing is what any good husband would do when they're in an argument with their wife, which is to realize that they are wrong and that they should apologize to their wife. And, if you do not understand this, you are missing one of the important parts of a good marriage. The husband is always wrong. So, Fred says, "Look, I'm late and I was inconsiderate. Let's not let it ruin our evening." The verb “to ruin” means to take something good and make it bad. We have a similar verb in English - "to spoil." "Let's not spoil our evening.” Let's not ruin our evening. Let's not make it a bad thing, turn it into something bad. Something that is good that becomes bad is "ruined." We also use that word as a noun in the plural. We say "these are ruins." Ruins is when you have, for example, in Greece, you find an old temple from classical Greece, from 450 BC. But, it isn't of course in the same condition. It’s…mo st of the things are missing, and lots of things are broken. Well, you go in and you look at those things and you call that area, "the ruins." So, ruins are when something has been damaged, something has been hurt. What remains of it later is called "the ruins." Well here ruin is used as the verb, to mean to spoil, to make worse.

Ginger says, "Okay, I'm sorry. Maybe I overreacted." To "overreact" as a verb, all one word…to overreact means that you replied or responded to someone in a way that was too angry, you got more angry or more upset than the situation called for, or that was appropriate for the situation. So, for example, your son may come in and say, "Dad, I broke my watch." And you say, "You broke your watch? I'm never going to buy you another watch again!" Well, that would be overreacting. It was a small thing and you make it into a big thing. You make a big deal about it, a big deal of it. So, that’s to "overreact."

And, Ginger surprisingly says, "I overreacted. I know you've been really busy." Fred says, again as a good husband, "I'm the one who’s sorry. I should have called.” "I should have," meaning it was my obligation, it’s something I was supposed to do. I should have called. “Will you let me make it up to you?" “To make something up" to someone means that you try to do something good for that person after you did something bad. So, you may say to your son who broke

 his watch you son begins to cry, because you yelled at him and you say "I'm sorry, let's…let’s go get some ice cream." So, you're trying to "make it up" to them. You're trying to do something better for him because you did something wrong.

Ginger says, "You don't have to…Yo u don’t have to make it up to me. I shouldn't nag." “To nag," as a verb, means couple of things. It’s a word that is often used for wives or girlfriends who keep bothering their husband or their boyfriend about something. They keep telling them, and they keep telling them, and they keep telling them, and finally the man may say, “Stop nagging me,” stop bothering me." It definitely has a negative meaning. A man, of course, can also nag somebody else. You may even use this expression in other circumstances, but it’s usually used in a relationship, and often of women, which is probably not fair, but that is how it is often used.

Fred says, "You weren't nagging.”  “You weren’t nagging. Let's go get something to eat,” he says. “We'll both feel better with some food in our stomachs." “To have food in your stomach," of course, means "to eat." So, he's saying, "Let's go eat. We'll feel better when we have some food in our stomachs." Your stomach is where your food is after you eat it, at least right away. It later goes other places. Ginger says, "Yeah, you're right. Let's go."

Now, let’s listen to this wonderful fight at a native rate of speech.

[start of story] Ginger:  I can't believe it.  You're late again!

Fred:  I got caught up at work. What are you so worked up about?

Ginger:  I've had it up to here with your excuses. If you knew you were going to be late, why didn't you call? We've been over this a hundred times.

Fred:  There wasn't time to call. And plus, what's the big deal? I'm just a little late.

Ginger:  A little late? You’re an hour late. You are so inconsiderate sometimes…[sigh]…Yo u look tired.

Fred:  Yeah, I am. Look, I'm late and I was inconsiderate. Let's not let it ruin our evening.

 Ginger:  Okay, I'm sorry. Maybe I overreacted. I know you've been really busy at work.

Fred:  I'm the one who’s sorry. I should have called. Will you let me make it up to you?

Ginger:  You don't have to. I shouldn't nag.

Fred:  You weren't nagging. Let's go get something to eat. We'll both feel better with some food in our stomachs.

Ginger:  Yeah, you're right. Let's go. [end of story]

# Shopping for a Cell Phone

complete transcript and additional information, go to our website at www.eslpod.com. Today's podcast is called, “Shopping for a Cell Phone.” Let's go. > Greg:  I needed a new cell phone, and my friend recomme nded the company he used. I went into the store to take a look.
> Woman:  Hi, have you been helped?
> Greg:  No, I haven't. I'm looking for a new phone.
> Woman:  Are you with our company right now?
> Greg:  No, I'm thinking about switching.
> Woman:  Okay, let me show you our most popular phone. This one has a lot of good features. It's got a camera phone, a video recorder, instant messaging, and you can download music or ring tones.
> Greg:  I'm really looking for a flip phone.
> Woman:  Oh, in that case, this is the one you want. Let me tell you a little about our plans. With our $59.99 plan, you get 400 minutes, unlimited night and weekend minutes, and free mobile-to-mobile.
> Greg:  Do the minutes roll over if I don't use them all in one month, and do I need to sign an agreement?
> We're looking today to buy a new cell phone or cellular phone. “Cell” is short for “cellular.” These are often called mobile phones as well, but most people now call them a cell phone, or simply a cell. Someone says, “I don't have my cell with me,” they mean their cell phone. Well, in the story, the person in the story, Greg, he needs a new cell phone, and his friend recomme nded the company he was using. In the United States, there are probably four or five big companies that you can get cell phone service from. And so, in this case, in this story, he goes to the store where that company has their phones. Many of the companies have their own stores. There are some stores that sell for different companies. So, you can look at two or three different companies in one store. It depends on the company that you are interested in.

 Well, the salesman begins by saying, “Hi, have you been helped?” So, the salesperson walks up - it’s a salesperson here, not a salesman because it’s a woman; so it’s a saleswoman.  The saleswoman walks up to Greg and says, “Have you been helped?” meaning, Is anyone helping you? Has someone come up to you already and asked to help you? The other expression you might hear when you walk into a store is “May I help you?” Do you need any help? You may also hear someone say, a salesperson say, “Can I help you find anything?” and you either say, “Yes, I'm looking for this…,” or you say, “No thanks, I'm just looking.” You can also say “No thank you, I'm just browsing.” “To browse” means to be looking, but at a very relaxed rate…very…n ot in a hurry.

Greg says that he hasn't been helped, that he's looking for a new phone, which is a good thing because he's in a cell phone store. Greg's a smart person. The salesperson says, “Are you with our company right now?” What she means is do you have a phone, a cell phone right now that's connected with our company that you get telephone service with our company. So, she says, “Are you with our company?” meaning do you have a contract, do you have a plan right now for your phone with our company. Greg says, “No, I'm thinking about switching.” “To

 switch,” as a verb, means to change, to change one thing for another thing. So if you own a Windows PC, a Windows computer with Microsoft Windows operating system and you decide to switch to a Mac, like I did, that would be a use of that verb, “to switch.” To take one thing and to put something else there instead.

So, Greg is thinking of moving, or switching, to this company. The saleswoman says, “Okay, let me show you our most popular phone. This one has a lot of good features.” A “feature” is something about the thing that you want to buy, some good thing about the item or the thing that you are buying. Almost anything can have features. A computer can have different features. One of its features is it has a small screen or it has a good keyboard or it has lots of memory. Those would all be features of a computer. The features of a cell phone of course are different. The saleswoman says, “I've got a camera phone,” or rather the phone she is showing him has a camera phone. She says, “It's got a camera phone.” That's a somewhat informal use for it has a camera phone, but it's very common: “It's got a camera phone.” A “camera phone,” you probably know, is a little camera inside the cell phone. You can take a picture. A “video recorder,” and here is again with a little camera you can record a small movie, a video recorder.

Instant messaging - so you can use your phone to talk to somebody else. Usually, instant messaging on a phone, it is with what we call “text” or “text messaging.” Text messaging is when you send a message to someone else's phone by using the letters that are on what we would call the “pad” or the “keypad” of the phone. The pad or the keypad of the phone is the numbers that you press. And, of course, the numbers have letters connected to them that you can send a message. You can also download music or ring tones with this phone. Well, to “download,” you know from the Internet means to take something from one computer and put it on another computer. So, you can download things onto this phone. In this case, you can download music. Some of the phones now you can download music directly from iTunes, for example. Or, you could download ring tones. “Ring tones,” two words, is the sound that the phone makes when it rings, and many people have special ring tones that are songs or different kinds of music. I don't have any of this. I just have whatever the ring tone that was in the phone when I bought it. That's my ring tone.

Greg says, “I'm looking for a flip phone.” A flip phone is a phone that opens up. Some phones you just have a little phone, and you don't have to open anything. A flip phone is one that you flip open or you open up. I have a flip phone, for example. The saleswoman says, “Oh, in that case, this is the one you want.” “In

 that case,” meaning in that situation. Oh, for your situation, for what you want, this is the phone for you. So, in that case, this is the one you want.

“Let me tell you a little about our plans “ she says. Their “plans” for a cell phone mean the amount of minutes that you get, and the kinds of things you get with your cell phone. In the story, the plan has 400 minutes, unlimited weekend and night minutes, night and weekend minutes. “Unlimited” means, of course, that there is no limit, that you can use as many as you want. So, you get 400 minutes during the day, unlimited night and weekend minutes, and free mobile-to-mobile. “Mobile-to-mobile” or “cell-to-cell” means that you can call another cell phone that has the same company and they won't charge you any money. All of this is for $59.99, fifty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents. Sounds like a great deal.

Many times the cell phones in the United States now will also come, the newer phones will come with a voice plan and a data plan. The voice plan is for using your phone as a regular phone to talk to people. The data plan is when you use your phone to connect your computer to the Internet, for example, and those phones are more expensive and the plans are more expensive. I think the typical phone with the Internet connection on it would probably be about $80 a month or so.

One thing you need to understand if you don't live in the United States is that the United States, in terms of its cell phones, is not as advanced as other countries, especially in Europe and Japan. We are, just this year really, getting good phones that you can connect to the Internet. Many of the best cell phones that are in Europe and Japan are not here in the United States.

Well, Greg asks the saleswoman if the 400 minutes that he gets will roll over. “To roll over,” as a verb, means that…let's say you have 400 minutes in July, and you only use 200 minutes. If the minutes roll over, in August you would have 600 minutes: 400 for August and then 200 that rollover from July. So, Greg is asking if the minutes roll over from month to month. He also wants to know if he has to sign an agreement. An “agreement” here means the same as a contract, saying I will be a customer for one year or two years or 25 years. Probably not 25 years, but at least a couple of years. The salesman says—I’m sorry, the saleswoman– says, “We don't have rolllover minutes,” but if 400 minutes a month isn't enough, they have plans that you can buy more minutes with. Greg says, “Okay, let me think about it,” and the saleswoman says, “No problem” - means It's okay, no problem. We use that expression “No problem” a lot. It's something that you

 would say to someone who, for example, thanks you for something. “Thank you for helping me.” You might say “No problem.” Here, no problem means don't worry, go ahead, and take your time to think about it. The saleswoman ends by saying, “Just let me know if you have any other questions.”

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[start of story] Greg:  I needed a new cell phone, and my friend recomme nded the company he used. I went into the store to take a look.

Woman:  Hi, have you been helped?

Greg:  No, I haven't. I'm looking for a new phone.

Woman:  Are you with our company right now?

Greg:  No, I'm thinking about switching.

Woman:  Okay, let me show you our most popular phone. This one has a lot of good features. It's got a camera phone, a video recorder, instant messaging, and you can download music or ring tones.

Greg:  I'm really looking for a flip phone.

Woman:  Oh, in that case, this is the one you want. Let me tell you a little about our plans. With our $59.99 plan, you get 400 minutes, unlimited night and weekend minutes, and free mobile-to-mobile.

Greg:  Do the minutes roll over if I don't use them all in one month, and do I need to sign an agreement?

Woman:  We don't have rollover minutes, but if you think 400 isn't enough, we have higher plans for 700, 1000, and unlimited minutes. The $59.99 plan requires a one-year agreement.

Greg:  Okay, let me think about it.

Woman:  No problem. Just let me know if you have other questions.

# Airport Layover

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast Number 180, “Airport Layover.”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast Episode 180. I'm your host Dr. Jeff McQ uillan coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Remember to look at the Learning Guide for this podcast on our website. Go to eslpod.com. You can get the complete transcript, definitions, additional sentences, cultural notes, and more in this 8-10 page Learning Guide for each of our podcasts. Today's podcast is about going to an airport and having to wait for your plane. Let's get started.  > I was going to see a friend of mine in Oklahoma City and decided to use my frequent flyer miles. I booked a flight, but the only one they had had a long layover in Denver. I had three hours to kill and I decided to get something to eat at the food court.
> Unfortunately, I didn't check my bags and had my roller bag and carry-on with me. I lugged them with me, but when I got to the food court, all of the tables were taken.
> Man: Do you want to share my table?
> Anne: Oh, uh, thanks, that would be great. It's packed in here.
> Man: Yeah, it's always like this on Friday afternoons.
> Anne: You must travel a lot.
> Man: Yeah, it's part of my job. It looks like you've got a lot of stuff with you. Do you want me to keep an eye on it while you get your food?
> Anne: Thanks, but I think I'll take it with me. But, if you could save this seat for me, that would be great.
> Man: Sure, you got it.

 We're spending some time in the airport in this podcast. The podcast is called, “Airport Layover.” A “layover” – all one word – is when you have to take a plane to another city, but you can't go directly from your city to the city you’re traveling to. You have to stop at a third city and get another plane to take to your city. For example, if you were going to fly from Los Angeles to London, you may have to take a plane from Los Angeles to New York, and then a second plane from New York to London. We would call that a layover. You have a layover in New York.

Well, this is about an airport layover. The story begins by Anne saying that she was going to see a friend of hers in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City is in the state of Oklahoma. And Oklahoma is located right in the middle, really, of the United States, just to the south of the middle part of the United States, the center part. Oklahoma is north of the state of Texas, south of the state of Kansas, and that is Oklahoma.

Well, Oklahoma City is where Anne is going. She says that she decided to use her frequent flyer miles. “Frequent flyer miles” refers to a program that many airplane companies, airlines have.  And, that is that, every time you fly, they give you certain number of points. And, if you get enough points, you can have a free flight, you can get a free trip. So, we call these programs “frequent flyers” because “frequent” means something you do a lot, many times, and a “flyer” is a noun is the person who flies, is in this case called the flyer. So, the frequent flyer miles or points is what she's using. She's going to use those to get a free airplane ticket to go to Oklahoma City. Well, she booked a flight and “to book” as a verb means to make a reservation. She reserved a place on the plane. She reserved a ticket for herself. We use the verb to book for planes, you can use it for hotels. “I booked myse lf into the hotel” or “I booked a hotel room,” means I made a reservation. I called the hotel and asked them for a room.

Well, she books a flight, or a trip, to Oklahoma City, but the plane didn't go directly from Los Angeles. She had a layover in Denver. She had to stop in Denver first before she could go to Oklahoma City. She then says that she had three hours to kill. When we say we have “time to kill,” we mean that we have extra time, that we don't have anything else to do. Usually its time that you would prefer not to have to be somewhere. But, sometimes, for example when you’re traveling, you have a layover and the layover may be one, two, three, maybe even six or seven hours in the airport. Well, you can't go anywhere else, so you have to kill that time, you have to do something to keep yourself busy because

 you don't have the option of leaving, you can't leave that place. In this case, you can't leave the airport. So, she has three hours to kill in the airport. Her layover is three hours, we would also say. She has three hours to kill so she decides to go and eat something at the food court. The “food court” – two words – is a place in an airport or in a shopping mall or in another building where you have lots of restaurants that sell food and they are usually restaurants that you walk up to and order your food and you take your food and you sit at a table. So, there will be a large area with lots of tables and then several restaurants. Often, these are fast food restaurants. “Fast food” means that give you your food quickly. Restaurants like McDonald's hamburgers. That's a fast food restaurant that you would probably see in a food court.

Well, she goes to this food court in Denver. She says that unfortunately, she didn't check her bags. “To check” your bags means; well first of all, the word bags here means your luggage. So, someone says how many bags do you have when you're traveling, they mean how many pieces of luggage. How many suitcases do you have or other sorts of bags. “To check your bags” means that you go to the ticket counter at the airport, and the “ticket counter” is where you can buy tickets and you can reserve your tickets. It's also where you check in. To “check in” means to say, "Yes, I'm here," and they give you what's called a boarding pass, and that's like your permission to go on the airplane. Well, when you go to the airplane or airline ticket counter at the airport, you can give them your baggage. You can give them your luggage. Baggage is another word for luggage. So, your baggage or your luggage, you give them that and so you don't have to take it with you on the airplane. You don't have to take it all the way through the airport. When you land at the city where you are going, in this case, Oklahoma City, you can go and pick up your luggage. The area where you go and get your luggage in the airport is called the “luggage claim area.” “Claim” is, here means the same as pick up, to get back. So, you go the luggage claim area, or the baggage claim area to claim your luggage, to get your luggage.

Well, in this story, Anne did not check her bags. She instead had a roller bag and a carry on with her. A “roller bag” is a suitcase that has wheels on it and that you can fit easily in the airplane. When you go into the airplane, you have two places you can put your luggage or your bags. One is in front of you, below the seat of the person in front of you. The other is in what we would call the overhead compartments. The “overhead compartments” - a compartment is just a space; an overhead is something over your head, so something above you. The roller bags are designed to fit into the overhead compartments. They're sometimes

 called the overhead bins; it’s the same thing – an overhead compartment, an overhead bin. So, you take the roller bag and put it above you. She has a roller bag in our story, but Anne also has another carry on.  “Carry-on” is any luggage that you take with you onto the airplane. So, technically, actually, the roller bag is also a carry-on. But, when someone says I have a roller bag and another carry- on, or and a carry-on, they usually mean a smaller bag like a purse, for example.

Anne says the she lugged her roller bag and her carry-on with her. “To lug,” as a verb, means to carry or to take with you, but the idea is that it is difficult, it causes you problems, its, for example, very heavy, or very big. So, you can lug something which is difficult to move or is…gives you some problems. That's the verb, to lug, to move something big or heavy. There's another word that you will, a Yiddish word, which is “to schlep.” It's a word that you will hear in cities like New York or Los Angeles, with a large Jewish population, that language of Yiddish. And, we have lots of words in English now that come from Yiddish, “schlep” is one of them and it means the same as, here, to lug, to carry.

Well, Anne says that she lugged her bags with her and when she got to the food court, all the tables were taken. When we say the tables, or the chairs are taken we don't mean somebody takes them from you, we mean there is somebody already there, somebody already sitting in that space. So, for example you could be at a movie theater and you're with your friend and you sit down and your friend goes to buy some popcorn and some soda. Someone comes to you and points to the seat next to you, where your friend is going to sit, and says, "Oh, is that seat taken?" You say, "Yes, this is taken." - means someone else is already sitting here. Well, all the tables were taken in the food court. A man sitting at one of the tables asks Anne, "Do you want to share my table?" “To share” means that you let someone else use something that you have. You are both going to use it - that is to share. We also use that verb, to share, sometimes to mean to, tell a group of people something that you feel or some opinion you have. We may say, "Does anyone want to share their opinions?"  - meaning tell the rest of you and its usually with a group of people, but it doesn’t have to be. Here, however, share has the more common meaning of to let someone else use something that you have.

Anne says, "Thanks, that would be great. It's packed in here." “It's packed.” When we say it's packed in a place, we mean there's lots of people there, it's very crowded, there's many people in a small space - we say it's packed. You can say that about a plane, you can say that about a restaurant, you can say that

 about a movie theater - any place where there are lots of people, you can say it's packed, if there are a lot of them or too many of them. Well, the man says that's it's always packed in the food court on Friday afternoons. Anne asked the man, "Well you must travel a lot." – meaning it seems likely that you travel a lot because you know that it is always crowded on Friday afternoons. The man says, "Yeah, its part of my job." It's part of what he has to do.

"It looks like you've got a lot of stuff with you." “Stuff” is the same as things, it’s an informal way of saying things. And, people use the word stuff to mean almost any collection of things. You, for example, go to a meeting and you have a presentation that you are giving and you have some paper that you want to give to people that has the information on it and you forget it in your office. You go to the meeting and you’re going to say, "Oh, I forgot my stuff." – means I forgot the things that I wanted to bring. So, stuff has a lot of different uses. Here, the man says, "You've got a lot of stuff." He means you've got a lot of bags, a lot of luggage. He asks Anne if she wants him to keep an eye on her luggage while she gets her food. “To keep an eye on something” means to watch something. Usually to watch something for someone who has to leave for a short period of time and then come back. For example, when I go to the cafe, I may have my computer with me and some books. And, I have to use the restroom, the bathroom. So, I say to the person sitting next to me, "Can you keep an eye on my stuff?" and we see both of those words. "Can you keep an eye on my stuff?" - meaning can you watch my computer and my books so that no one steals them. It’s often the case that we often ask that of people who we don't know. But, because they are sitting there, we somehow trust them. I think someday I'm going to ask someone to watch my stuff and I'm going to come back and my stuff and that person are going to be gone. I hope that doesn't happen.

Well, Anne says that she decided that she will take her stuff with her. She says, "Thanks, but I think I'll take it with me." - or take my stuff with me. This means she does not want to leave it there with the man. She's going to take it herself and that's probably a good idea. You don't want to trust people in a place like an airport, a public place, people that you don't know. There are lots of thieves, lots of people who steal things in airports, so you have to be very careful. Well, she says that she's going to take it with her, but she asks the man if he can save this seat for her. “To save a seat” means to say to anyone else who wants to sit there that that seat is taken. So, I'm going to make sure no one else sits here. I'm going to save your seat.  And, people do that…again to use the example of a movie theater, they may come to the movie theater and their friend hasn't arrived

 yet. Well, they'll sit down and they’ll put a coat or something, a hat on the seat next to them to save it for their friend. So, when their friend comes, they have a place to sit. The man says, sure, he can save Anne's seat. And, he ends by saying, "You got it!" “You got it” is the informal way of saying, “You have it!” "You have got it!" or "You've got it!" But, you sometimes hear people say, "You got it!" It's an informal way of saying "Yes, I will do that for you.” “I will help you in that way."

Now, let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech. > I was going to see a friend of mine in Oklahoma City and decided to use my frequent flyer miles. I booked a flight, but the only one they had had a long layover in Denver. I had three hours to kill and I decided to get something to eat at the food court.
> Unfortunately, I didn't check my bags and had my roller bag and carry-on with me. I lugged them with me, but when I got to the food court, all of the tables were taken.
> Man: Do you want to share my table?
> Anne: Oh, uh, thanks, that would be great. It's packed in here.
> Man: Yeah, it's always like this on Friday afternoons.
> Anne: You must travel a lot.
> Man: Yeah, it's part of my job. It looks like you've got a lot of stuff with you. Do you want me to keep an eye on it while you get your food?
> Anne: Thanks, but I think I'll take it with me. But, if you could save this seat for me, that would be great.
> Man: Sure, you got it.

# Company Profiles

complete transcript of this podcast. Today's podcast is called, “Company Profiles.” Let's get started. > Roberta: What are you working on?
> Lee: Oh, I'm writing the company profiles for the businesses participating in the meeting next month. Do you have a minute to give me some feedback?
> Roberta: Sure, what do you have so far?
> Lee: I've started to write the ones for Landrun and Max Electronics. This is what I have for Lundrun so far:  “A Fortune 500 company, Lundrun is a world leader in car manufacturing. Founded in 1936, Lundrun today is a $90 billion dollar company that sets a standard in the industry.”
> Roberta: That's pretty good. Don't forget to mention that their headquarters are in Chicago.
> Lee: Oh, yeah, I'll make sure I add that. Okay, here's what I have for Max Electronics:  “Max Electronics is a Frankfurt-based company that has been a pioneer in the manufacturing of home electronics for over 75 years. The company has a global network of 1,500 distributors and has stores in 53 countries worldwide.”
> Roberta: That's a good start. Why don't you pass them by me when you're done and I can give you some more feedback?
> Lee: Yeah, I'll do that. Thanks a lot.
> The title of this podcast is, “Company Profiles.” A “profile” is a description of someone or something, usually it’s about a person, but it can also be, in this case, about a company. So, it gives basic information. It's a basic description, not detailed, usually not very, very long, but enough information to allow you to understand this person or to understand this company.

Our dialogue begins with Roberta asking Lee, "What are you working on?" “To be working on,” here means, What are you doing? What are you working on? What project are you working on?  And, Lee says, "I'm writing the company profiles for the businesses participating in the meeting next month." So, they're having a meeting next month with different companies, different businesses and Lee is writing a description, a short description of each one of these companies. He's writing a profile.

He then asks Roberta, "Do you have a minute to give me some feedback?" "Do you have a minute to give me some feedback?" That expression, "Do you have a minute to do (something)" is a way of asking someone if they have time right now to help you. We sometimes use this expression without the verb at the end. We sometimes say, "Do you have a minute?" And, that means, "Do you have time right now to help me?" In this case, she says, he says rather, "Do you have a minute to give me some feedback?" “Feedback” is information, reactions that you give to someone about something that they have done. So, feedback would be, for example, if you emailed us here at ESL Podcast and said, "You're doing a great job!" or "You're doing a terrible job!" That would be feedback. You can email us about what a great job we're doing, by the way. If you don't like what we're doing, Well, that's okay. We want to hear that, too, but not as much as we want to hear about the good job.

Well, Roberta says, sure, she has time to help him. "What do you have so far?" So, she's asking him, "How much work have you done?" "Tell me what you have done up to this point, or up to this minute." That's the meaning of the expression, "so far." "So far, I have $100 saved in my bank account to buy a new computer." Up to this point, up to today, that's how much money I have saved, so far. Lee says that he started to write the profile for two companies. One of the companies called Lundrun, which is not a real company, he describes as a “Fortune 500 company.” “Fortune” is a famous business magazine in the United States, Fortune magazine. And, every year, they have a list of the 500 biggest

 companies in the United States and this is called the Fortune 500. And, everyone in business knows what this means. So, if you say to an American businesswoman, "Is your company in the Fortune 500?" They say, "Yes, we're a Fortune 500 company.” “We're one of the 500 biggest companies." Well, Lundrun is a Fortune 500 company. The word “fortune,” by the way, can mean a lot of money. "He has a fortune," means he has a lot of money.

Well, Lundren is also a world leader in car manufacturing. A “world leader,” you can guess, means a company that is one of the best in the world. They're a world leader in car manufacturing. The verb, “to manufacture,” means to make. So, they are one of the world's largest car makers, or car manufacturers, that would be the noun. Someone who manufactures something is a “manufacturer.” We can also call it manufacturing, with an -ing at the end. So, they're a world leader in car manufacturing, the making of automobiles. This company was founded in 1936. When we say a company is founded, or an organization is founded, we mean this is when they began, this is when they started. You can say the United States was founded in 1789, when we had our first Constitution. Well, actually it was our second Constitution. But, we usually talk about the founding of a country, or the founding of an organization or a company. And, the people who start a company, or start in the case of the United States, a country, are called the founders. And, the founders are people who are the ones who begin something, who start something.

Well, Lundren was founded in 1936 and it's now a $90 billion dollar company which is a lot of money, I think. I have a billion or so, so $90 billion is 90 times what I have. Well, this is a Fortune 500 company, a $90 billion dollar company that sets a standard in the industry. “To set a standard” or “to set the standard,” which is another expression, maybe a little more common, means that they are the leaders and what they do, everyone else watches, everyone tries to do the same because they have a very high level of quality, they do things very well, they set the standard or they set a standard. In general, the word “standard” is, it's a goal, it's an objective, it's something that you want to do, but usually these are things that are, that many people agree on. So, in California, for example, we have standards for our schools. And, this is a list of things that children are supposed to know at each grade. That's a standard. So, in this case, this case is setting a standard, or setting the standard in the industry, means all of the other companies, the other car manufacturers are watching this company to see what they do.

 Roberta says the description is pretty good that Lee has written. She says, "Don't forget to mention that their headquarters are in Chicago." A company's “headquarters” is where the company has its many offices. The Center for Educational Development has its headquarters in Los Angeles, or its world headquarters, for the entire world, here in Los Angeles. Well, there are different companies that have their headquarters here in Los Angeles. Most of the movie studios have their headquarters here, the companies that make movies. The computer companies have, many of them have their headquarters in Northern California, in San Francisco or in San Jose, in towns that are near those cities in Northern California, that's where their headquarters are. Well, Lundrun's headquarters are in Chicago. Lee says, "Oh yeah, I'll make sure I add that." I'll put that in the description.

Then he reads his description for the second company, Max Electronics. He says, "Max Electronics is a Frankfurt-based company." Frankfurt, a city in Germany, hyphen “based.” When we say that it's a Frankfurt-based or Los Angeles-based or New York-based, we mean that, it's just another way of saying that's where they're headquarters are. That's where their company is, in that city. You can say, "We're based in Los Angeles," using it as a verb. We are based here, means this is where our home is, this is where our headquarters are. Max Electronics is a Frankfurt-based company but has been a pioneer in the manufacturing of home electronics. A “pioneer” is a person who does something, one of the first people to do something, someone who is a leader, who does something that no one else has done before, usually in a particular area. So, for example, Apple Computer and Microsoft Computers are both…those companies are pioneers in the personal computer industry or the personal computer business. They were some of the first companies to do things in this area. ESL Podcast is a pioneer in language teaching podcasts. We are, not the first, but one of the first to have a podcast for teaching English. There are others, of course, and some who came before us, but we won't talk about them.

Well, we are…Ma x Electronics is a pioneer in the manufacturing of home electronics. “Home electronics” is a general term to describe anything that is electronic in your house, that seems clear: the television, the stereo, the…what else can be home electronics…a  big screen TV, a DVD player, a cassette recorder, all of these are home electronics. Things that you would use in your home.

 The company has a global network of 1,500 distributors. A “global network” is a term that you may hear in describing a company. The word “network” usually means that there are different people or different companies that are connected somehow, that are, that are connected to each other. So, if you say I have a network of people who sell my product, the things that I make, means you have a group of people and these people are connected to you, somehow. In this case, Max Electronics is a global, and “global” is just another word for in the entire world, a global network of 1,500 distributors. When we talk about a “distributor” in business, we're talking about a company that sells thing for the main company. So, its usually, for example, a store. A store could be…could sell many different things. They could sell the home electronics from Max Electronics. They would be a distributor of that particular company's products or the things that they make. So, distributors are people that sell things to you, sometimes the distributors are people who sell things to other businesses and that's also a use of that term.

Well, Max Electronics has stores in 53 countries worldwide. “Worldwide,” all one word, is the same as global, means in the entire world. Roberta says that this description is a good start. “It's a good start.” That's a polite way, a nice way of saying, "That's good, but its not good enough." So, when someone says to you, "That's a good start," they mean, "Okay, what you've done so far is a good beginning, but its not finished yet. You have to keep working on it." She says, "It's a good start. Why don't you pass these descriptions, these profiles, by me when you're done?" “To pass (something) by (someone)” means to show them that, to give them, for example, the piece of paper or send them an email and have them look at it first before you send it to someone else. So, to pass something by means to have someone else look at it, usually its your boss or someone who is going to help you make it better. Lee says, "Yeah, I'll do that. Thanks a lot."

[start of story] Roberta: What are you working on?

Lee: Oh, I'm writing the company profiles for the businesses participating in the meeting next month. Do you have a minute to give me some feedback?

Roberta: Sure, what do you have so far?

Lee: I've started to write the ones for Landrun and Max Electronics. This is what I have for Lundrun so far:  “A Fortune 500 company, Lundrun is a world leader in

 car manufacturing. Founded in 1936, Lundrun today is a $90 billion dollar company that sets a standard in the industry.”

Roberta: That's pretty good. Don't forget to mention that their headquarters are in Chicago.

Lee: Oh, yeah, I'll make sure I add that. Okay, here's what I have for Max Electronics:  “Max Electronics is a Frankfurt-based company that has been a pioneer in the manufacturing of home electronics for over 75 years. The company has a global network of 1,500 distributors and has stores in 53 countries worldwide.”

Roberta: That's a good start. Why don't you pass them by me when you're done and I can give you some more feedback?

Lee: Yeah, I'll do that. Thanks a lot. [end of story]

# A Star Trek Convention

complete transcript of this podcast. Today's podcast is a little different. Today we are going to talk about a famous television show in the United States and the conventions that people have with this television show. It's a very interesting part of American culture. It's called Star Trek. Engage. > Guido: Whoa. Check you out. That's a great costume. Are you going to the Star Trek convention?
> Rita: Yeah. It's in town until Sunday. Have you ever been to one?
> Guido: Me? No way. Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of the shows and, no offense, but I thought only geeks went to the conventions.
> Rita: Yeah, I thought that too until I went last year with my friend Claire and we had a great time.
> Guido: Claire? Your gorgeous roommate Claire? That Claire?
> Rita: Yeah. There were exhibitions from collectors and we got autographs from two of the show's stars. The highlight was when the stars came out and spoke to the crowd. Hey, do you want to come with us?
> Guido: It actually sounds like fun but I can't make it today.
> Rita: How come?
> Guido: Um…w ell…I'm going to the comic book convention.
> Our podcast today is about the Star Trek conventions. Now, I mentioned before the dialog that Star Trek which is spelled “Star Trek,” two words, was a popular television series here in the United States. It…the original series was back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and they then made another version of Star Trek later in the 1980s and 90s and then they made another version a few years ago. So, there have been a couple of different versions and you may have seen the Star Trek movies and these movies were based upon or they used the television series. And, the idea for Star Trek is that there are people who have formed a government for all the different planets, the United Federation of Planets, I believe it was called, and this government has people from different planets. So, it has humans but it also has other people from other planets. This, of course, is all what we would call science fiction. “Science fiction” is stories or movies about things in the future. This television show is supposed to be in the future. a couple of hundred years from now, and it was very popular in the United States and many of the stars of this show became very famous, especially the original show.

Well, a lot of people are…liked the show, became fans of the show, and so they started having meetings. And, these meetings are called conventions and they're places where people sell things that are related to the television show. They may have posters, big pictures you put on your wall. Many people put on clothing that looks like the people from the television series. So, it's a very interesting cultural phenomenon, a cultural situation with these Star Trek conventions.

Well, let's get back to our dialog, and in our dialog, Guido begins by saying to Rita, “Whoa. Check you out.” The expression “Whoa” here is used to express surprise. When you're surprised or even shocked by something; it’s very surprising. You may go, “Whoa.” You weren't expecting it. We also use whoa sometimes to mean to slow down, not go so fast. But here, it means a surprise. So, Guido says, “Whoa. Check you out.” The expression here, “Check you out,” means look at you, you are looking very perhaps beautiful or you are looking very strange. The expression “to check (something) out” means to look at it, to pay

 attention to it. So, Guido says, “Check you out. That's a great costume.” A “costume” is clothing that usually an actor or an actress wears for a television show or a play or a movie. A costume can also be something that you wear to make you look like someone else. Little children, for example, on Halloween in…at the end of October, they put on costumes to make them look like ghosts and Superman and Spiderman and those are all costumes that people put on.

So, Guido says that Rita has a great costume and he asks her, “Are you going to the Star Trek convention?” So, obviously her costume must be from the television series. And, Rita says, “Yeah, it's in town until Sunday.” When we use he expression “in town” we mean that a particular show or event is traveling from one city to another and when it comes to the city where you live, you say, “Well, it's in town.” So, you could have, for example, a circus. A “circus” is when they have animals that do tricks, that can do special things, and people who do tricks. We call that a circus and the circus moves from town to town. So, when it comes to your town or your city, we say it's “in town.” We don't use the expression “in city” or “in metropolitan area.” We would just say “in town” and that means in the city or the town where you are.

Rita asks Guido if he has ever been to a Star Trek convention and Guido says, “Me? No way.” Notice that he doesn't say, “I” he says, “Me.” In normal conversation people don't use “I.” When someone says, “Are you going?” you don't say, “I?.” You would say, “Me?” If you were asking a question, “Do you mean me?” is what we are saying here. Guido says, “No way” meaning not at all, that is completely not something that I would do. Then he says, “Don't get me wrong.” “Don't get me wrong” is an expression you use with someone when you are saying something that they might not like or you are saying something that they might not understand or might be easy for them to misunderstand or to not understand. So you say, “Don't get me wrong” and usually you are going to explain something more clearly to someone.

Guido explains that he's a fan of the shows. A “fan” is somebody who likes something. You can be a fan of a soccer team. You can be a fan of certain kinds of music or certain singers. Well, he is a fan of the Star Trek television shows. He then says, “No offense, but I thought only geeks went to the conventions.” The expression “no offense” is also an expression you use when you are going to say something to someone that they probably will find insulting, when you are going to say something negative to someone that might hurt them or they might think that you are trying to insult them, to say something bad about them. So, he says,

 “No offense” meaning don't get mad, don't think I am insulting you and he goes on to say, “but I thought only geeks went to the conventions.” A “geek” a general term, an informal term we use for someone who is, usually someone who is intelligent, someone who is smart but also somebody who doesn't have a lot of friends, who likes to sit on their computer all day, who likes electronics or computers and they may not have a boyfriend or a girlfriend. That would be the idea of a geek. It's usually not a good thing to say to someone but some people say, “Oh yeah, well, I'm a geek” and they're proud of their being a geek. Well, Guido says that he thought only geeks went to the convention and Rita says, “Yeah. I thought that too,” that's what I used to think, “but last year I went to this convention with my friend Claire and we had a great time,” we really enjoyed ourselves. Guido then says, “Claire? Your gorgeous roomma te Claire?” “Gorgeous” means very beautiful. It's especially a word that we would use to describe a very beautiful girl or woman. You can also use it to describe, for example, the weather. “We're having gorgeous weather” means we're having very nice weather. It's sunny. It's warm. That would be gorgeous weather for most people. A “roomma te,” as you probably know, is a person that you share an apartment or a house with, someone that you live with and that you both pay part of the rent for the apartment or for the house. So, Guido wants to know if this is the same Claire that is…w ho is Rita's roomma te.

Rita says, “Yeah. There were exhibitions at the convention from collectors.” “Exhibitions,” exhibitions are when you show something to someone else. The verb “to exhibit” means to show, to let someone else see something. Exhibitions would be, in this case, where people who are selling things show you what they are selling. And, in this case, the people who are selling things are collectors. “Collectors” is anyone who likes to collect or buy different things. Usually, they are things that are all about the same topic. For example, you could be a collector of stamps. You like stamps. You keep…collect old stamps. You find old stamps or stamps from different countries and you put them in a book. That would be a stamp collector. Well, in the Star Trek convention, the collectors are people who buy things related to Star Trek, in this case.

Rita also says that they got autographs from two of the show's stars. An “autograph,” an autograph is someone's signature. Usually, it's a famous person. And so, if you see, I don't know, Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie or Jeff McQ uillan walking down the street you may say, “Can I have your autograph?” Well, not Jeff McQ uillan but the other two definitely. So, that's an autograph and they got the autograph, Rita and Claire got their autographs, from two of the show's stars.

 A “star” is a person who is very popular. They're the main person in that play or that TV show or that movie. So, for example, the star of Mission Impossible III is Tom Cruise. He's the main actor. He's the most important person. Rita also says that the highlight of the convention was when the stars came out and spoke to the crowd. The “highlight,” all one word, the highlight of something, of an event is the best part, one of the best parts, the thing that you liked the most or one of the things that you liked the most. In this case, one of the things that Rita and Claire liked was when the stars of the show, the actors, came out and they talked to the crowd. A “crowd” is a group of people, usually a group of people at a big event. You could have a crowd at a baseball game, a crowd at a soccer game, a crowd at a convention or a conference.

Guido says, well Rita asks Guido if he wants to come with them to the convention and Guido says, well he can't go because he's going somewhere else. He actually says, “It sounds like fun but I can't make it today.” “To be able to make (something),” to make the movie, to make the convention means that you are able to go. Someone says, “Would you like to come to my house for dinner on Thursday?” and you may say, “Oh, I'm sorry I can't make it that day. Can we make it another day?” Can we do it another day? So, I can't go. And Guido says he can't go. Rita asks him, “How come?” “How come” is the same as “why,” a little more informal. How come?

Guido says, “Well, I'm going to the comic book convention.” “Comic book,” two words, or comic books plural, are books that have drawings or pictures in them. Usually, they're of what we would call superheroes. “Superhero,” all one word, a superhero would be for example Superman, Spiderman, let's see, Batman. Those are some superheroes from American popular movies and television shows. And, comic books are very popular especially among children because they have nice pictures and they have interesting stories. Comic books actually are very good ways also to improve your English because you have the pictures to help you figure out the vocabulary and some of the vocabulary in comic books is quite difficult. So, even if you're an advanced student, comic books are popular, can be, I should say, useful. Well, Guido says he's going to a comic book convention which is kind of funny because he said that he thought only geeks went to a Star Trek convention, but a comic convention or a comic book convention is a meeting of people who like comic books and sell comic books. So, that's also considered by some people to be kind of a geeky thing, that only geeks would go to a comic book convention.

 Rita says, “Oh I see. Well, maybe next year. Live long and prosper.” The expression, “Live long and prosper,” “prosper” is from the television series, from the Star Trek television series, one of the sentences what we would call the lines, the lines, one of the things that the characters on the show say, at least one of the characters, is, “Live long and prosper.” If you watch Star Trek you know that this is what one particular group of people called the Vulcans say. Live long and prosper. “To prosper” means to do well, to make a lot of money or to be successful, that's to prosper. Guido says, “Yeah. You too and say…tell Claire I said ‘hi.’” Guido, of course, is still interested in Rita's roommate Claire because she is very beautiful. Rita says, “Sure. See you later.”

[start of story] Guido: Whoa. Check you out. That's a great costume. Are you going to the Star Trek convention?

Rita: Yeah. It's in town until Sunday. Have you ever been to one?

Guido: Me? No way. Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of the shows and, no offense, but I thought only geeks went to the conventions.

Rita: Yeah, I thought that too until I went last year with my friend Claire and we had a great time.

Guido: Claire? Your gorgeous roommate Claire? That Claire?

Rita: Yeah. There were exhibitions from collectors and we got autographs from two of the show's stars. The highlight was when the stars came out and spoke to the crowd. Hey, do you want to come with us?

Guido: It actually sounds like fun but I can't make it today.

Rita: How come?

Guido: Um…w ell…I'm going to the comic book convention.

Rita: Oh, I see. Well, maybe next year. Live long and prosper.

Guido: Uh, yeah. You, too. Hey, tell Claire I said “hi.”

 Rita: Sure. See you later. [end of story]

# At the Pharmacy

# Running a Meeting

complete transcript on our website. Now let’s begin. > Good morning, everyone.  I believe we are all here.  Please be seated and let’s get started.
> Please join me in welcoming Olivia Dansk, from Garland Corporation.  I’m afraid that Lionel Wu from Manatect can’t be with us today, but I’m pleased to welcome representatives from both Danforth and Boyent.
> We’re here today to discuss the progress of our joint venture project.  Have you all received a copy of the agenda?  Good.  As you can see, there are six items on the agenda.  If there are no objections, I suggest we take the items in order. Let’s start with number 1. …… I think that takes care of the first item.  Why don't we move on to item number two.  I’d like to hand it over to Olivia, who will take us through the report.  Olivia? …… If there are no other issues to discuss, I’d like to wrap up this meeting.  Our next meeting will be on Monday, November 20th.  Before we end today, I’d like to thank all of you for coming.  This has been a very productive meeting.

In this podcast, we are at a meeting, at a business meeting. And, the person who is speaking is running the meeting. And, the name of the podcast is “Running a

 Meeting.” “To run” means that you are the person who is in charge. You are the boss of the meeting. Well, the meeting begins by me, greeting everyone, saying “Hello, everyone,” “Good morning, everyone.” Notice that everyone is used to refer to all of the people there. Informally, you might say, “Good morning, guys!” but that’s not something you would say in a business meeting. In a business meeting, you would use something like “everyone.” “Everyone, can I have your attention?” or “I would like everyone to sit down so we can begin.” In this case, I say that, I begin by saying that, “Good morning everyone. I believe we are all here” - meaning that I think everyone who is supposed to be at this meeting is here. “Please be seated and let’s get started.” “Please be seated” is a nice way, a polite way, of asking people to sit down. You would not want to say: “Please sit down.” You could, but “please be seated” is nicer, little more polite, little more formal.

Well, the meeting begins with the person running it saying, “Please join me in welcoming Olivia Dansk.” “Please join me in welcoming” is a way that you are telling everyone else in the meeting that they should welcome, say hello to, or at least realize that there is a new person here. “Please join me in welcoming.” The expression “please join me in” is used in other situations as well. “Please join me in singing song number 255 in your book,” if you are in church, for example, and the person in front wanted everyone to sing. They may say, “Please join me in singing.” You can use that in a lot of different circumstances. The verb is always in the -ing form after “in.” Please join me in welcoming, in singing, in running, whatever it is. Olivia Dansk is a person that they are welcoming. She’s from the company called Garland Corp., which is not a real company, just a company we used here.

I go on by saying, “I’m afraid that Lionel Woo from Manatect can’t be with us today.” “I’m afraid that” is again a polite way of saying “unfortunately” or “I’m sorry that.” Someone may ask you, for example, if they can use your car. And, you may say, “Well, no, I’m afraid that I can’t let you use my car. I have to leave now.” So, I’m afraid that is a nice way of telling someone “no” or telling that what they want is not possible. In this case, Lionel Woo from a company called Manatect could not be at the meeting. The expression we used here is, “he can’t be with us.” “To be with (someone)” means to be there, to be present, to be at the meeting. Well, “Mr. Woo can’t be with us, but,” he goes on, “I’m pleased to welcome representatives from both Danforth and Boyent.” “I’m pleased to welcome” is another way of, again, saying hello, welcoming someone, thanking him for being there. “I’m pleased to welcome representatives…” Representatives

 here just mean people who work at that company. These are people who are going to represent the company. They’re going to be the ones that will listen and speak for the company.

The meeting continues by the person saying, “We’re here today to discuss the progress of our joint venture project.” American business meetings usually are, or tried to be very much, but we would say it to the point. “To the point” means here’s we going to do, let’s do it, and let’s leave after we’re done. Don’t want to spend a lot of time talking about other things. So, it’s very commo n for the person beginning the meeting to tell everyone why they are here. What is the purpose of the meeting? To remind them of the purpose of the meeting. So this person begins by saying, “We’re here today to discuss the progress,” how well we are doing, “on our joint venture project.” A “venture” often means something very similar to a project, a venture is something that you do, something that you are trying to do. Usually, it is a way of trying to make money. In this case, it’s called the joint venture because they are different companies working together. “To join” as a verb means “to put together.” So, a joint venture would be a business project that different companies work on together, in order to make money.

The meeting continues. “Have you all received a copy of the agenda.” The “agenda” is the list of things that they’re going to talk about in the meeting. They are usually in order, so number 1, number 2, number 3 - these are the topics of today’s meeting. Those are on an agenda. He goes on to say, “As you can see, there are six items on the agenda.” An “item” is here the same as there are six things, there are six topics that we are going to talk about. “If there are no objections, I suggest we take the items in order,” he says. “If there are no objections…” What we’re saying here is: “If it’s okay with everyone here.” If there are no objections means “I am assuming that everyone agrees with me on what we should do.” Of course, if you have an objection, an objection, objections - plural, is when you disagree with someone. When you want to say something against the plan or the idea, that would be an objection.

So, “if there are no objections” means if no one has anything to say that disagrees with me, “I suggest we take the items in order.” “To take something in order” means you start with number one, then you go to number 2, then go to number three. The opposite of that is “to take things out of order.” And, “out of order” means that you may do number one, then you do number five, then you go back and do number 3, and so forth. Out of order also, that expression also

 means something is broken. So, you may say that your telephone is “out of order” - means its not working, it’s broken.

Well, in this meeting, which is probably the shortest meeting in the history of business, the meeting that we have here is just parts of the meeting. So, after the person says, “I suggest that we take the items in order,” he says “let’s start in number one.” But, you notice when you’re listening that the volume went down, that’s because we’re not giving you the whole meeting. We’re giving you just parts of the meeting, so you can hear the different kinds of vocabulary. When the person starts talking again, after they’ve taken care the item number 1, which we don’t hear, he says, “I think that takes care of the first item.” “To take care of” can have a couple of meanings. Here, it means “to handle,” “to pay attention to,” “to solve.” “I think that takes care of the first item” means “I think we’re done with it,” “I think we’ve talked about what we need to talk about.” To take care of someone can also mean to help them. “I’m taking care of my mother because she is sick.” I go over there. I cook her a meal. I bring her food. I talk to her. I’m taking care of her.

“Why don’t we move on to item number 2?” he says. “Why don’t we move on…” To “move on,” two words, means continue. Why don’t we stop talking about this item and continue on with the next item? Sometimes, we use that expression when someone spending too much time on something. And, your boss might say, “Are you still working on that project? Move on to something else.” There it means stop doing that and start something different. Well, he suggests in our meeting here that we move on to item number 2. He then says, “I’d like to hand it over to Olivia.” “To hand (something) over to (someone)” means that you are going to let them talk or let them be the one who is the leader of the meeting. The one who is going to take care of the next section. So, “he hands it over to Olivia” means Olivia will now talk and not the person running the meeting. He ask Olivia to take us through the report. “To take (someone) through something means to go over with them, means to talk about it in detail, to give them lots of specific information. If someone says, “Let me take you through the plan,” that means they want to talk to you to each part of the plan to give you some information. Well, once again, the meeting, we miss a part of the meeting here because Olivia is now going to talk but we don’t hear to what Olivia has to say. Poor Olivia. Maybe the next dialogue we can hear from Ms. Olivia. The meeting then starts to come to an end. The person says, “if there are no other issues to discuss.” An “issue” here means a topic. If there’s nothing else that anyone wants to discuss. In saying this, he’s really saying to anyone in the meeting, “If you have something

 else you want me to talk about, you want us to talk about, you should let me know. Raise your hand, for example, or tell me right now. It’s a good way of ending a meeting. “If there’s nothing else,” and then you may wait a second to see if anyone says anything. And, if they do, then you can talk about that additional item. He says that “If there are no other issues to discuss, I’d like to wrap up this meeting.” “To wrap up” as a verb in this story means to end, to stop. “I’m going to wrap up this meeting” means we’re going to conclude this meeting. We’re going to stop this meeting. He announces when the next meeting will be. He says, “Our next meeting will be on Monday, November 20th.” “Before we end today,” meaning before we end our meeting. We’re not going to stop yet. I have one more thing. “Before we end today, I’d like to thank all of you for coming. This has been a very productive meeting.” “To be productive.” “To be productive” means to get all of the work done. To do a lot of work in a short amount of time. That’s to be productive. That’s something that I am not very good at. I am not very productive.

Now, let’s listen to the story, this time, at a native rate of speech.

[start of story] Good morning, everyone.  I believe we are all here.  Please be seated and let’s get started.

Please join me in welcoming Olivia Dansk, from Garland Corporation.  I’m afraid that Lionel Wu from Manatect can’t be with us today, but I’m pleased to welcome representatives from both Danforth and Boyent.

We’re here today to discuss the progress of our joint venture project.  Have you all received a copy of the agenda?  Good.  As you can see, there are six items on the agenda.  If there are no objections, I suggest we take the items in order. Let’s start with number 1. …… I think that takes care of the first item.  Why don't we move on to item number two.  I’d like to hand it over to Olivia, who will take us through the report.  Olivia? …… If there are no other issues to discuss, I’d like to wrap up this meeting.  Our next meeting will be on Monday, November 20th.  Before we end today, I’d like to thank you all of you for coming.  This has been a very productive meeting. [end of story]

# Ways to Pay

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast Number 185, “Ways to Pay.”

You’re listening to English as a Second Language Podcast Episode 185.  I am your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com for the Learning Guide that goes with this podcast. It includes the complete transcript, all of the vocabulary, additional definitions and uses, and cultural notes.

Today’s podcast is about the ways, or manner, that you can pay for something at a store.  Let’s get started. > I was at the store, and when the clerk finished ringing me up, I had a few problems. Clerk: Your total comes to $79.42. Peter: Do you take credit cards? Clerk: Yes, we take Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Peter: Here’s my Visa. Clerk: Hmm…I’m sorry but your card has been declined. Peter: Oh, I can’t imagine why. I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Here, use my MasterCard. Clerk: Well, sir, it looks like this one is overdrawn, too. Do you have a debit card or cash? We also accept personal checks. Peter: Like I said, I think it must be bank error. Yeah, I have a debit card, but I think there’s a fee for using it, right?
>  use.  Many stores have their own credit cards, so you could go to, for example, Robinson May, which is a department store, and they sell many different types of things, they have their own credit card that you can get from them. Well, Peter decides to use his Visa, his Visa credit card. The clerk then tries to process the credit card. “To process” means they take the card, and they put it through a machine that reads the card.  The verb we usually use there is, “to swipe.” To swipe a credit card means to take the card and put it into a machine that reads the information. Well, unfortunately for Peter, the clerk tells him that his card has been declined. When we say you credit card “has been declined,” that means the credit card company says to the store, this person doesn’t have money or there is a problem with their credit card account. And the company will not allow you to use the credit card. And this is what happens to Peter.  Maybe he didn’t pay his bill, maybe he’s used too much money for one month. Most credit cards have a limit to how much money you can spend in a month or in a certain amount of time. Peter says: “Oh, I can’t imagine why.” I can’t imagine why my credit card has been declined; that’s what Peter means.  I can’t imagine why, I don’t know why, I am surprised. You would use this expression when you are very surprised about something, you are telling the person that you have no idea, why this has happened. Peter says, “I am sure its just a mistake. Here, use my MasterCard.” He gives the clerk his MasterCard and, what happens? Well, it turns out that that card, the MasterCard, is declined as well. The clerk says, “It looks like this one is overdrawn too.” “To be overdrawn” means that you have spent too much money. You have gone beyond, or above your limit. “To overdraw,” as a verb, means to take more money or to try to spend more money than you actually have. In this case, to try to spend above your credit card limit. So the clerk says, “Do you have a debit card or cash? We also accept personal checks.” Other ways to pay are with a “debit card.”  A “debit card” is a card that takes money directly from your bank account. It doesn’t got to a credit card company. It goes directly to you bank and they electronically take the money. Cash, well, everybody knows what cash is.  The store also accepts personal checks. “Personal checks” is a check with your name on it, from your bank account. Peter says, “Like I said, I think it must be bank error.” A “bank error” is when the bank makes a mistake. So Peter is saying, “Oh, the bank has made a mistake.” He says, “I have a debit card, but I think there’s a fee for using it, right?” Peter is asking the clerk if his bank will charge him money, that is, if he

 will have to pay extra money to use his debit card. Most banks in the United States, you have to pay extra money each time you use a debit card that takes money out of your bank directly. A “fee” is money that you have to pay for something.  The clerk says, “Yes, I think the bank charges you a small fee.” The verb “to charge” means that they make you pay something. Peter says, “In that case, I’ll write a check.” But of course, this is Peter’s very unlucky day, and he says, “Oh no, I forgot my checkbook at home.” “Checkbook,” all one word, is the little book that has your checks in it, your personal checks. Peter says, “Can you hold these items for me?” “To hold (something)” at a store means that the store take what you want to buy and puts it in a place where no one else can buy it, and they keep it there for you until you come back to pick it up. Most stores will hold things for you for a short amount of time. Peter says, “I can run to an ATM to get some cash.” An “ATM” is an Automatic Teller Machine, this is a machine where you can get money from your bank account by putting in your ATM card, a special card the bank gives you to get money out of the machine.  Most people just call it an ATM but it stands for Automatic Teller Machine. A “teller” is actually the person who works at a bank, who gives you money at a bank, but this is a teller machine, so you’re getting it from a machine. Peter says, “I’ll come right back.” “To come right back” means I’ll return immediately, right after I finish getting my money from the ATM, I will come, and I will return here. I will come right back. The use of right there “right” means immediately. We say “right away,” we mean immediately.  So when Peter says: “I will come right back,” he means “I will return immediately.” The clerk says, “Sure, I can hold it for you until the end of the day.” The end of the day means, until we close tonight. So if it is four o’clock in the afternoon, and the store closes at 9 PM, they will hold it for him until 9 PM. And if he does not return by 9 PM, before 9 PM, they will put it back out in the store for someone else to buy. Peter says, “OK, great, I will be right back.” Now lets listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[start of story]

I was at the store, and when the clerk finished ringing me up, I had a few problems.

 Clerk: Your total comes to $79.42. Peter: Do you take credit cards? Clerk: Yes, we take Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Peter: Here’s my Visa. Clerk: Hmm…I’m sorry but your card has been declined. Peter: Oh, I can’t imagine why. I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Here, use my MasterCard. Clerk: Well, sir, it looks like this one is overdrawn, too. Do you have a debit card or cash? We also accept personal checks. Peter: Like I said, I think it must be bank error. Yeah, I have a debit card, but I think there’s a fee for using it, right? Clerk: Yes, I think the bank charges you a small fee. Peter: In that case, I’ll write a check. Oh no, I forgot my checkbook at home. Can you hold these items for me? I can run to an ATM to get some cash. I’ll come right back. Clerk: Sure. I can hold it for you until the end of the day. Peter: Okay, great. I’ll be right back. [end of story] The script for today’s podcast was written by Dr. Lucy Tse.

Helen:  Hey, didn’t you just say that May-December romances aren’t that uncommo n?  From what Diane tells me, they have a lot of things in common. # Enjoying the Outdoors

complete transcript, all of the vocabulary, sample sentences, cultural notes, and much more.

Today's podcast is called “Enjoying the Outdoors.”  Let's go.

[Start of story]

My favorite time of year is the summe r.  I like being outdoors, doing anything from hiking to going to the beach.  One thing about working in an office all week is that I don’t get much fresh air.  With summe r here, I plan to take full advantage.

Last week, I went to the beach with some friends.  I was glad I brought sunscreen since it was a really hot day, and I’m sure I would have gotten a sunburn within 15 minutes!  We set up our beach umbrella and beach chairs, and played some volleyball.  A few of us went into the ocean for a swim, but most of my friends just lounged around on the sand.

This weekend, I’m going hiking.  I stopped by the store and got some insect repellent.  The last time I hiked in the mountains, I came back with big mosquito bites all over my legs.  This time, I’m going to be prepared.  I was going to try a new trail and I wasn’t going to let a few mosquitoes get in the way.

[End of story]

In this podcast we are enjoying the outdoors.  The “outdoors,” which is all one word, is the same as “out of doors,” and both of those expressions mean to be outside of your house or outside of the building.  When people say the outdoors,

 they often are referring to, or talking about, going to the beach, or going to a park, or going camping. That's all considered outdoors.

I say in the story here, which is definitely a fictional story, because I am not like the person in this story at all.  I say my favorite time of year is summe r.  Well, that's true for me.  “The time of year” is the same as the season, in this case. “My favorite time of year is the fall,” my favorite season is the fall.  You can also talk about this if you are referring to, for example, Christmas time.  “My favorite time of year is Christmas,” the weeks around the Christmas holiday, for example. I say that I like being outdoors doing, anything from going hiking to going to the beach.  The expression, “anything from to,” “anything from X to Y,” “anything from hiking to going to the beach” means that you are talking about a variety, or a range of possibilities.  There are many things you could do outdoors, and so the person in this story is giving some examples - anything from hiking to going to the beach.

“Hiking,” it comes from the verb “to hike,” and to hike is to walk, usually to walk out in a park or in a desert, I suppose, or in the mountains, to walk somewhere, often, to walk up and down a hill or a mountain.  So, the person in this story, not me, likes to hike; I don't like to hike, but this person does.  They also like going to the beach.  I do like going to the “beach.”  The beach is where the ocean or a lake meets the land, where you have area right by the lake, or right by an ocean, is the beach.  I live about two miles from Santa Monica Beach, here in California.

The person in the story says, “One thing about working in an office all week is that I don’t get much fresh air.”  The expression here, “all week,” is the same as the entire week.  You're trying to emphasize the length of time here.  So one thing about working in an office during the week, or the entire week, or all week is that “I don't get much fresh air.”  “Fresh air,” two words, is being outside, is the…is going outside, and when we say something is fresh, we mean it's either new or it is in a very original or pure state.  In this case, the expression, fresh air, means being able to breathe the air outside.

Here, in Los Angeles, breathing the air outside is not always a good thing because there's so much pollution, but we'll go with the story here.  He wants to go outside to get some fresh air.  “With summe r here,” he says, “I plan to take full advantage.”  “To take advantage,” or “to take full advantage,” advantage is “advantage,” means to enjoy, to get the most that you can out of an experience. “I'm going to take advantage of the weekend to watch a lot of movies,” I'm going

 to use my time well, I'm going to use it so that I can get the most out of it, or the most, in this case, enjoyment out of it. There's another expression, “to take advantage of (someone),” that has a negative meaning.  When you say, “I'm going to take advantage of a person,” that can also mean that you are going to get something from them, more than what you should, something that isn't fair, from that person.  For example, “I'm going to take advantage of our friendship and ask you to give your car for this afternoon,” to let me use your car.  To take advantage of means I'm going to use my friendship to get something more than I should, so it has a negative meaning.  The positive meaning, in this story here, means to enjoy or make use of something, to make good use of something.

The story continues that, “Last week, I went to the beach with some friends.  I was glad I brought sunscreen since it was a really hot day.”  “Sunscreen,” one word, is the, usually, white liquid that you put on your arms and your legs, maybe your face, so that the sun doesn't make your skin red.  For people like me, who come originally from northern Europe where the skin is very white, this is important because if I don't put sunscreen on when I go outside in the sun, after 15, 20 minutes, my skin becomes red and I look a little like a tomato.  So I have to put on sunscreen when I go outside for a long period of time, and so does the person in this story.  He was glad that he put on sunscreen since it was a really hot day, meaning that it was a sunny day; sun was out, you could see the sun. He says, “ I’m sure that I would have gotten a sunburn within 15 minutes,” means if he did not put on the sunscreen, he would have gotten a sunburn.  “Sunburn,” is when your skin gets very red.  Sometimes it gets so red that it begins to hurt you.  That's a sunburn, or to get a sunburn.  That's also a verb, to sunburn. Usually it's an expression, we say, “I got sunburned,” or “I was sunburned,” with an “ed” at the end.

The story says that the person went to the beach and they set up, or put up, their beach umbrella.  An “umbrella” is something you use to keep the rain from hitting you.  That would be a rain umbrella.  A beach umbrella is something you use to keep the sun from hitting you, or from getting to you, so you can have “shade.” “Shade” is when you have something that blocks the sun, like an umbrella, and it's dark underneath.  A beach chair is a kind of chair that you would use on a beach.  Usually, these chairs are light and sometimes made of plastic.  Usually, they are folding chairs.  “Folding” means the chair collapses or becomes smaller, so you can carry it easily.

 They also, in the story, “played some volleyball.”  “Volleyball,” all one word, is when you have two teams, one on each side, and you have a “net” in between you, that's called a “volleyball net,” and you hit a little white ball back and forth over the net.  That is the game of volleyball.  I'm not a very good volleyball player.  “A few of us,” according to the story, “went into the ocean.”  An “ocean” is the same as the sea.  I live near the Pacific Ocean.  “We went in for a swim,” Here, swim is a noun.  “To go for a swim,” “we went in for a swim” - these both mean to go swimming or to swim, we went swimming. “But most of my friends just lounged around in the sand.”  “To lounge,” is a verb which means to relax, to sit, usually in a chair and not move, just to relax.  The “sand” is what the beach is usually made of.  It's, we hope, white or brown, and it's soft, and it is what you usually find near a ocean or a lake.

Well, this weekend, the story says, the person is going hiking.  He says he “stopped by the store,” meaning he went to the store, “and he got,” or he bought, “some insect repellent.”  “Insect” is a word which means the same as a bug or a fly, things that…little animals that fly around and can sometimes bite you, or cause a mark on your skin.  A “repellent” is something that stops the insects, or the flies, from biting you, from biting your skin.  Well, the last time this person went hiking in the mountains, he says, he came back, or returned, “with big mosquito bites.”  A “mosquito” is a type of bug, a type of fly, a type of animal that likes to bite you, and after it bites you, you have a little red spot, a little red area on your skin from the mosquito taking a little of bit of blood from you.  That's what they do when they bite you.  When I lived in Minnesota, growing up, there were always lots of mosquitoes during the summe rtime, and I always had a lot of mosquito bites because the mosquitoes liked my blood, I think.

Well, in this story he says that he's going to be prepared this time.  He wants to try a new “trail.”  A “trail” is the same as a path or a little road that you can walk on, usually in a park or in the mountains there's a trail where other people have walked before, and that makes it easier for you to walk.

The story ends by the person saying that he “wasn't going to let a few mosquitoes “get in the way.”  “To get in the way” here means to prevent you from doing something, to stop you from doing something.  “Don't let that get in the way,” means don't let that stop you, don't let that prevent you from doing what you want to do.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech.

 [Start of story]

My favorite time of year is the summe r.  I like being outdoors, doing anything from hiking to going to the beach.  One thing about working in an office all week is that I don’t get much fresh air.  With summe r here, I plan to take full advantage.

Last week, I went to the beach with some friends.  I was glad I brought sunscreen since it was a really hot day, and I’m sure I would have gotten a sunburn within 15 minutes!  We set up our beach umbrella and beach chairs, and played some volleyball.  A few of us went into the ocean for a swim, but most of my friends just lounged around on the sand.

This weekend, I’m going hiking.  I stopped by the store and got some insect repellent.  The last time I hiked in the mountains, I came back with big mosquito bites all over my legs.  This time, I’m going to be prepared.  I was going to try a new trail and I wasn’t going to let a few mosquitoes get in the way.

# Getting Home Late from School

complete transcript of this episode.

Today's podcast is called “Getting Home Late from School.”  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

Dad:  Where have you been?   Do you know what time it is?

Caitlin:  I’m sorry, Dad.  I lost track of time.

Dad:  Lost track of time?   We’ve been worried sick about you.  You were supposed to come straight home after school.

Caitlin:  I know, but Janet was showing me something in her locker when a fight broke out in the hallway.  The vice principal, Mr. Lopez, finally came out and broke it up.

Dad:  That still doesn’t explain why you’re late.  And, I don’t want any excuses.

Caitlin:  Well, one of the guys in the fight was Dan, Janet’s brother.  Mr. Lopez called their parents and I waited with her until they got there.

Dad:  I never liked Dan.  He’s trouble.  I don’t want you hanging around with him.

Caitlin:  I don’t.  I’m friends with Janet, not her brother.  I didn’t do anything wrong.

Dad:  Oh, really?  You missed curfew last week and now you’re late again.  Just wait until your mother hears about this.  You’re grounded for a week.

 Caitlin:  Dad!  That’s not fair!  None of my friend’s parents are as strict as you are.

Dad:  That’s enough.  I won’t have you talking back to me.  Now, go to your room.

[End of story]

This podcast is about a father and a daughter having a conversation, and it begins by the father asking his daughter, Caitlin, “Where have you been?” and you know from the way he says that that he's angry, he's mad.  “Where have you been?” Where were you?   “Do you know what time it is?”  Of course, he's asking her if she knows what time it is because she's late, and that's a common way of saying to someone you're very late: “Do you know what time it is?” Or if someone arrives very late and you were going to yell at them, like a father would, perhaps, yell at or speak very strongly to his daughter.  To “yell” usually means to shout or to talk very loudly.  So, to yell at someone is when you are angry with them and you talk very loudly.

Caitlin says, “I’m sorry, Dad.  I lost track of time.”  The expression, “to lose track” of time means that you didn't realize what time it was.  You didn't realize that you were late.  You were usually so busy doing something else, listening to ESL Podcast or reading a good book that you lost track of time, you didn't pay attention to what time it was.  And Dad says, “Lost track of time,” as a question, meaning he doesn't really believe her, or he isn't very happy with her answer.  He says, “We’ve been worried sick about you.”  The expression, “to be worried sick” means that you are extremely worried; you're very worried.  You don't know what happened to the other person, you think something bad might have happened to them.  And so we use the expression to be worried sick, worried so much that you almost feel sick.

Dad says, “You were supposed to come straight home after school.”  “You were supposed to” means that that was what you were told to do, that is what you had to do, that is what you should have done.  “You were supposed to.”  We use that expression a lot, supposed to, “I'm supposed to go school today,” means that they are expecting me at school.  I have an obligation to go to school.  Dad says that Caitlin was “supposed to come straight home after school.”  The use of the word “straight” here means imme diately, without stopping somewhere else.  So,

 if you tell someone “I'm going straight to the hospital” – that means I'm not going to stop at the store or at the post office and then go to the hospital.  I'm going to go directly to the hospital.  So here it can also mean, simply, directly home.

Caitlin says, “I know, but Janet,” we can guess is one of her friends, Janet, she says, “was showing me something in her locker.”  She wanted me to see something in her locker.  A “locker” is a small box, usually a metal box that you can lock, that's why we call at a locker, and it's where you keep things.  In most American high schools there are lockers in the halls, in the space between the rooms where the students walk, the hall or the hallway, we would say, all one word, “hallway.”  There are lockers, and each student gets…or usually gets their own locker, they may have to share their locker.  It's a place where they can put their coats in the morning, they can put books, extra books they don't need, and they can go back to their locker, they can put their lunch, if they bring their lunch, in their locker.  You'll also find lockers at a gym, where you can put your clothes while you are exercising.  And, there are lockers in many airports, where you can leave something and take the key.

Well, Caitlin says that her friend Janet was showing something in her locker, a locker that belonged to her, “when a fight broke out in the hallway.”  When we say a fight “broke out,” we mean that it began, that it started.  We often use that verb, “to break out,” when we're talking about something like a fight, something that starts suddenly.  A hallway, we've already talked about, is the path, or that place where students walk to go from one classroom to another in a school, or in any building.  “The vice principal,” Caitlin continues, “Mr. Lopez, finally came out and broke it up.”  The “vice principal” is the person in he school who works for the principal.  The principal is the leader of the school.  We use that word, principal, for high schools, for junior high schools, for grade schools or elementary schools. We don't use it for colleges.  We don't say the head of the college is the principal. We only use that for high school or younger.  Well, the principal is the boss of the school, and he, or she, has usually one, and sometimes three or four people who are vice principals, and they do some of the work that the principal doesn't have time to.  Of the one of the things that a vice principal does is take care of discipline problems.  “Discipline” is the same as behaving or behavior, in this case.  When we talk about discipline problems, we're talking about kids who are doing things wrong, and the vice principal has to punish them or tell them that they are doing something wrong and give them some punishment, some price they have to pay.  Not a price in the sense of money, but often they have to stay

 in school after the school day ends.  That would be a punishment that the vice principal might give a student who was causing problems.

The vice principal is often called the assistant principal, or just AP, and that is the same person.  Of course, sometimes students do things that are more serious, and so the assistant, or vice principal has to give them a more serious punishment.  Staying in school after the day ends is a pretty good punishment, though.  It's saying that school is such a painful place to be that if you have to stay there longer, that's a punishment.  Well, that's the way most students think of the situation.  “Mr. Lopez,” the vice principal, “came out and broke the fight up.”  “To break a fight up” means to stop a fight, to stand in between the two people who are fighting and separate them.  That's to break up a fight.  The police can also break up a fight or break up an argument.

Well, Dad says that Caitlin's story doesn't explain why she was late, doesn't say or give the reason why she was late.  Dad says that “I don’t want any excuses.” An “excuse” is a reason why you did something, usually a reason why you did something wrong or something incorrectly.  And, it can just mean the reason, but often it means a bad reason.  Someone says, “Don't give me any excuses,” means don't give me any bad reasons or false reasons why you did something wrong.  Caitlin then explains that “one of the guys,” in this case one of the boys in the fight was Janet's brother, Dan.  Mr. Lopez called Dan and Janet's parents, and Caitlin waited with her friend, Janet, until Janet's parents came to the school to pick them up.  Well, Dad says, “I never liked Dan.  He’s trouble,” meaning he causes problems, he causes trouble.  Somebody says, “she's trouble,” means she causes problems.  He tells Caitlin that he doesn't want her “hanging around with him.”  “To hang around with (someone)” means to spend time with them as a friend.

Caitlin says that she doesn't hang around with Dan, she hangs around with Janet, Dan's sister, and that she “didn't do anything wrong.”  Now, we can guess that Caitlin is a teenager, and most teenagers think that they never do anything wrong.  So, Dad says, “Oh, really?”  He doesn't believe Caitlin.  He tells her that she “missed curfew last week.”  “Curfew” is the time, in this case, children or teenagers have to come home.  So, if your curfew is ten o'clock that means that you have to come back home, from where ever you are, by ten o'clock at night. And many parents give their teenage children a curfew, so they don't want them coming home too late.  The idea, of course, is that they will stay out of trouble.

 Dad says, “Just wait until your mother hears about this.”  “Just wait until” – this is a very commo n expression that a parent may say.  “Just wait until your father hears about this,” means that your father, or here in this story your mother will be very angry when she finds out.  “Just wait until your mother hears about this.” “You're grounded for a week.”  “To be grounded” means that you can't leave the house to do anything fun.  You can go to school, but when you're done with school, you have to come home right away, imme diately, and not go anywhere else.  And that, again, is a commo n punishment that parents will give their children. They will ground them for a week or ground them for a month.  “To ground” means to tell the child that they can't leave the house.  And Caitlin, of course, is not very happy.  And she says, “That's not fair,” which is what every teenager says to their parent.  “That's not fair,” they're not being just; they're not being fair.  Caitlin says none of her “friend’s parents are as strict as” her father is. “To be strict” means that you have lots of rules, and that you expect your children to obey or to follow all of these rules.  If you have lots of rules and you are very…yo u tell your children they have to follow all of them, you may be called strict.

Dad says, “That's enough.”  He doesn't want to hear Caitlin talking anymore. “That's enough.  I won’t have you talking back to me.”  “I won't have you,” means I am not going to allow you, or permit you, or let you talk back to me.  “To talk back” means that someone is, usually a child, is arguing with the parents and saying things that are not respectful of the parent, and that is to talk back.  It's usually something we use with a child talking to the parent in a way that is not one that the parent likes.  Finally, Dad says, “Go to your room.”  Again, this is a very traditional punishment for children if they do something wrong.  We tell them to go to their room, meaning go to their bedroom and don't leave.  They can't watch television or do other things, that's the idea.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Dad:  Where have you been?   Do you know what time it is?

Caitlin:  I’m sorry, Dad.  I lost track of time.

Dad:  Lost track of time?   We’ve been worried sick about you.  You were supposed to come straight home after school.

 Caitlin:  I know, but Janet was showing me something in her locker when a fight broke out in the hallway.  The vice principal, Mr. Lopez, finally came out and broke it up.

Dad:  That still doesn’t explain why you’re late.  And, I don’t want any excuses.

Caitlin:  Well, one of the guys in the fight was Dan, Janet’s brother.  Mr. Lopez called their parents and I waited with her until they got there.

# Taking a Phone Message

# Changing Money

complete transcript, definitions, additional explanations and culture notes.

Today's podcast is called “Changing Money.”  Let's go.

[Start of story]

I was at the airport to pick up my friend Sandra, who was visiting from Italy.

Gustavo:  Do you have everything?

Sandra:  Yes, I think so.  But, I don’t have any U.S. dollars.  Where can I change money?   Can I do that here?

Gustavo:  You could, but I wouldn’t recomme nd it.  The exchange rate is really high and so are the fees.  I’ll take you to the bank tomorrow.

The next day, I picked Sandra up from her hotel and we went to a branch nearby.

Bank clerk:  What can I do for you?

Sandra:  I’d like to exchange some currency and to get some U.S. dollars.

Bank clerk:  Okay, how much would you like?

Sandra:  How much is one euro worth?

Bank clerk:  The current rate is one dollar to .8 euros.

Sandra:  In that case, I’d like 500 U.S. dollars.

 Bank clerk:  Okay.  That will be 400 euros.  Would you like that in large or small bills?

Sandra:  I’d like a mix of both. I’d like some change, too.

Bank clerk:  That’s no problem.  Please sign here.  That will be 300 dollars in 20’s, 150 dollars in 10’s, and 45 dollars in fives and ones.  And, here’s five dollars in change: quarters, dimes, and nickels.

Sandra:  That’s perfect.  Thanks a lot.

Bank clerk:  Is there anything else I can help you with?

Sandra:  No, that’s all.  Thanks for your help.

Bank clerk:  It’s my pleasure.  Have a nice day.

[End of story]

Today's podcast is called “Changing Money.”  “To change money” means to convert it from one country's money to another country's money.  So, to take your dollars, for example, your U.S. dollars, and convert them, or change them, into yen or euros or whatever the country's money is.

The story here is that Gustavo is picking up his friend, Sandra, from Italy. Gustavo goes to the airport and asks Sandra, “Do you have everything?” meaning do you have all of your bags, do you have all of the things that you need.  He's picking her up from the airport, and so, he wants to make sure that she has all of the things she needs for them to leave the airport.  Sandra says, “Yes, I think so.  But, I don't have any U.S. dollars.  Where can I change money? Can I do it here?”  “Where can I change money?” as we said before, where can I convert my money into U.S. dollars?  Gustavo tells her that he would not recomme nd changing money at the airport.  “To recomme nd” means here the same as to suggest.  “I recomme nd talking to that beautiful woman sitting over there.  I think she's interested in you.”

Well, Gustavo is not talking about beautiful women; he's talking about the exchange rate.  He's telling Sandra that she should not change money at the

 airport because “The exchange rate is really high.”  The exchange rate tells you how many dollars you can get for how many, in this case, euros, or whatever the money is.  I should say that another word we use for money, when we are talking about changing money, is “currency.”  So, you can say, “The currency of Italy is the euro.”  That's what they call their money that they use now.

Well, “The exchange rate is really high,” Gustavo says, which means that you are not going to get very many dollars for the euro if you change the money at the airport.  Gustavo also says that the fees are high.  A “fee” is like a price that you have to pay for something, and when you change money – or exchange money, means the same thing – at the airport, you often have to pay an extra fee in order to change your money.  Gustavo tells Sandra that he will take her to a bank tomorrow where she can exchange her money.  So, the next day he goes to Sandra's hotel and they go to a branch nearby.  A “branch” is one of the offices of a bank.  Usually, there's a main office, a large office, and then there are smaller offices, smaller parts of the bank in different parts of the city, and so a branch of a bank is usually one office of a very large bank that has many offices.

They go to this branch and the bank clerk – who sounds a lot like Gustavo in the dialect, but it's a different person – the bank clerk says, “What can I do for you?” and Sandra says, “I’d like to exchange some currency and to get some U.S. dollars.”  Notice that she's using the verb “to exchange” in the same way as “to change.”  They mean the same, as we said before.  Also notice that she says currency instead of money because those mean the same as well.  The bank clerk says, “Okay, how much would you like?” And Sandra asks, “How much is one euro worth?”  “How much is (something) worth?” when we are talking about currency or money, means how many dollars can I get for my euro.  How many…how much money can I get for my euro?

So, the bank clerk says that, “The current rate,” or the current exchange rate, “is one dollar to .8 euros.”  This means that for every .8 euro that you exchange, you will get one dollar.  If the exchange rate were one dollar to one euro, then for every euro you give the bank, they'll give you one dollar.  But in this case, the exchange rate is one dollar to .8 euros.  Sandra says she'd “like 500 dollars,” and the bank clerk said, “That will be 400 euros.  Would you like that in large or small bills?”  A “bill” when we are talking about money, or currency, is the paper form of money.  We have a dollar bill in the United States and a five dollar bill in the United States.  The bills are the, are the paper money.

 So, he asks Sandra if she wants “large or small bills.”  Large means, of course, that the bill would be worth a lot of money, so a hundred dollar bill is a large bill and one dollar bill is a small bill.  You'll also hear the word “denomination.” “Denomination” is how much the money is worth, how many dollars.  And so, we could say that the U.S. bills come in denominations of one, five, ten, 20, 50 and 100.  Well, Sandra says she wants “a mix of both,” meaning she wants some small bills and some large bills.  She then tells the bank clerk, “I’d like some change, too.”  “Change,” again when we are talking about money, means coins – not paper money, not the bills, but individual coins, such as a penny or a nickel or a dime.  In the United States, most of the coins that we have, most of the change that we have, would be less than a dollar, although we do actually have a one dollar coin and a one dollar bill, but very few people use the coin.

The bank clerk says, “That’s no problem.  Please sign here.”  He's asking her to put her signature on a piece of paper.  Then he begins to, we would say, “count out” the money.  “To count out,” two words, is when you are giving money to someone else and you are telling them how much it is as you give it to them.  So, you're giving someone 20 dollars, you say, “Okay, five, ten, 15, 20,” you give them four five dollar bills and you count it as you give it to them.  So, the bank clerk is counting out the money.  He's giving her “300 dollars in 20’s.” Notice we use the plural here, 20’s; it means 20 dollar bills; “150 dollars in tens,” ten dollar bills; “45 dollars in fives,” five dollar bills; “and ones,” one dollar bills.  The only bills that you can find normally in the United States are one dollar, five dollar, ten dollar, 20 dollar; you will sometimes see 50 and 100 dollars, but they're not as commo n.  Most people have a five, ten, 20 or ones.  In fact, many stores will tell you that they will not accept a denomination higher than 20 dollars, meaning you cannot give them a 50 dollar or 100 dollar bill; they will only take 20s, tens, fives and ones.

The bank clerk also gives Sandra her change, her coins.  He gives her quarters, dimes, and nickels.  A “quarter,” you probably know, is 25 cents, one quarter of a dollar.  A “dime” is ten cents, a “nickel” is five cents and, of course, we also have a one cent coin, which we call the “penny,”  Sandra says, “That's perfect.  Thanks a lot.”

The bank clerk, who's very polite, says, “Is there anything else I can help you with?” meaning do you want anything else, do you need anything else.  Sandra says, “No, that’s all.  Thanks for your help.”  The bank clerk says, “It’s my

 pleasure.  Have a nice day,” and of course, Sandra will have a nice day because she now has 500 dollars to spend.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

I was at the airport to pick up my friend Sandra, who was visiting from Italy.

Gustavo:  Do you have everything?

Sandra:  Yes, I think so.  But, I don’t have any U.S. dollars.  Where can I change money?   Can I do that here?

Gustavo:  You could, but I wouldn’t recomme nd it.  The exchange rate is really high and so are the fees.  I’ll take you to the bank tomorrow.

The next day, I picked Sandra up from her hotel and we went to a branch nearby.

Bank clerk:  Okay, how much would you like?

Sandra:  How much is one euro worth?

Bank clerk:  The current rate is one dollar to .8 euros.

Sandra:  In that case, I’d like 500 U.S. dollars.

Bank clerk:  Okay.  That will be 400 euros.  Would you like that in large or small bills?

Sandra:  I’d like a mix of both and I’d like some change, too.

Bank clerk:  That’s no problem.  Please sign here.  That will be 300 dollars in 20’s, 150 dollars in 10’s, and 45 dollars in fives and ones.  And, here’s five dollars in change: quarters, dimes, and nickels.

 Sandra:  That’s perfect.  Thanks a lot.

Bank clerk:  Is there anything else I can help you with?

Sandra:  No, that’s all.  Thanks for your help.

Bank clerk:  It’s my pleasure.  Have a nice day.

# Winning the Lottery

complete transcript of this podcast.

Today's podcast is about being very lucky, about “Winning the Lottery.”  Let's go.

[Start of story]

Daniela:  I got our lottery tickets during my lunch break.  The jackpot is up to $168 million dollars.  Imagine if we won.

Boris:  Thanks for getting mine, too.  When is the drawing?

Daniela:  Saturday at 6 PM.  It’s being televised on Channel 4.

Boris:  What would you do if you had $168 million dollars?

Daniela:  The first thing I would do is quit my job!   No more slaving away for me. What would you do?

Boris:  If I were rich, I would travel around the world.  If I were younger, I’d learn how to fly a plane.  I’ve always wanted to do that.

Daniela:  It’s never too late.  You could still do that.

Boris:  You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.  I’d probably just retire and buy myse lf a nice new house.

Daniela:  Yeah, that sounds nice.  I suppose I’d have a lot of family and friends asking for money.

 Boris:  I know I would.  I can just see them coming out of the woodwork and pestering me.  Maybe winning the lottery isn’t such a good thing.

Daniela:  You’re right.  It’s a curse.  When you win, you can give me all of the money.

Boris:  Yeah, right.  Don’t hold your breath!

[End of story]

Today's podcast is about winning the lottery.  The “lottery,” sometimes called the “lotto,” is a contest, usually run by the government where you can win a lot of money by buying a ticket, and you buy a ticket that has the right numbers. Usually, there are five or six numbers, and if you have the same numbers as the winning number, then you win the prize.  Here in the United States, there is no national lottery, but we do have state lotteries.  Individual states have lotteries and some groups of states have lotteries.  California has a lottery and it is also part of a group of, I think, 10 or 11 states that has a bigger lottery.  Well the lottery is, of course, almost impossible to win.  Usually the chances of you winning are very low.  That means that you will probably not win the lottery if you buy a ticket, but of course, people want to believe that they will someday win the lottery, so it's still very popular.

Our dialogue begins with Daniela saying that she “got our lottery tickets during” her “lunch break.”  A “tickets” is the piece of paper that has your lottery numbers on it.  You can pick your lottery numbers, you can decide which numbers you want, or you can let the computer give you some numbers.  When you win a lottery, the money is called the “jackpot,” all one word.  The “jackpot” is the money that you win if you win the first prize, you match all of the numbers for the lottery, and in this example, the jackpot is $169 million dollars.  That is actually possible in some lotteries.  Normally, the jackpot is at least seven or ten million dollars for a state lottery, and sometimes it can go up to two or even three hundred million dollars.  But mostly it's between, say, 10 and 50 million dollars. Only 10 to 50 million dollars!   You see that's why I don't normally buy a lottery ticket.

We actually use the verb “to play” the lottery.  Like you play sports, you can play the lottery.  I don't normally play the lottery myse lf unless the jackpot is more than

 100 million dollars because, you know, for 50 million dollars, it doesn't seem like it is worth my trouble to go to the store!

Well, Daniela says that, “The jackpot is $168 million.  Imagine if we won.” “Imagine” here is used as a comma nd form of the verb, what we would sometimes call the imperative form of the verb where you are telling someone to do something, you are ordering someone to do something.  But here, it's not, it's not something that she's really ordering.  She's saying to Boris, her friend, “Imagine if we won,” try to imagine if we won.  Notice that the verb “won” is in the past tense, and this is the way that this particular construction in English works. The gramma r in English is that if you are thinking about something which isn't true, which is just in your imagination, we often use the past tense verb.  So, “Imagine if we went to Japan;” “Imagine if President Bush were a woman.” Okay, don't imagine that, but you get the idea.  “Imagine” takes the past tense of the verb because it is a made up situation.

Well, Boris thanks Daniela for getting his lottery ticket.  He asks her, “When is the drawing?”  The “drawing” is when they select the winning numbers.  Usually there is a…like a box that has all of the numbers in them, and there are usually little balls, like golf balls or ping pong balls, small balls with the numbers, and there is a machine that selects the numbers for the winning ticket, and that usually happens once or twice a week.  Here in California, we have a lottery twice a week, so there are two drawings each week.  “To draw” means to take something out, in this case.  Daniela says the drawing is “Saturday at 6 PM.  It’s being televised on channel 4.”  “To be televised” means that it will be on the television.  They will, you will be able to see it on the television; it will be televised.

Boris says, “What would you do if you had $168 million dollars?”  This expression, “What would you do if…?” is asking the person to imagine what they would do.  The word “would” is here used as a conditional, meaning if a certain situation, or a certain condition, were true, what would you do?  Notice also that the verb in the second part of the sentence is in the past tense, just like in the example about, “Imagine if we won.”  Boris says, “What would you do if you had,” past tense, “$168 million dollars?”  Daniela says, “The first thing I would do is quit my job!”  “The first thing I would do” is a expression to indicate what the most important thing you would do.  “The first thing I would do if I had $168 million dollars is to buy a new house.”  It's the thing I would do before anything else. Now, you could then go on and say, “the second thing,” “the third thing,” and so

 forth.  We use that word, “thing,” in English a lot to mean the first event or the first action.

Well, the first action that Daniela would take would be to quit her job.  She says, “No more slaving away for me.”  “To slave,” or “to slave away,” means to work very hard, like you are a slave.  A “slave,” as a noun, means a person who is owned by another person.  Here in the United States, we had slaves up until the U.S. Civil War in the 19th century, which was from 1861 to 1865.  Well, Daniela says that she won't be “slaving away,” she won't be working for someone else if she won the lottery.  Boris said, “If I were rich,” notice again the past tense, “If I were rich, I would travel around the world.”  There again is a sentence with would as conditional and the past tense in the other part of the sentence.  So, “If I were rich, I would travel around the world,” in that situation.  “If I were younger,” Boris says, “I’d learn how to fly a plane.  I’ve always wanted to do that.”  “I've always wanted to meet the queen of England.”  “I've always wanted to be able to eat as much as I wanted to and not get fat.”  This expression, “I've always wanted to,” is expressing something that has been your desire for a long time.

Daniela says, “It’s never too late,” meaning Boris can still learn how to fly a plane, even though he's not young anymore.  “It’s never too late;” there's still a chance, there's still an opportunity.  Boris replies that, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.”   You can’t teach an old dog new “tricks.”  Well, you know what a dog is; a trick is something that you teach the dog to do.  Usually it's something simple, like sitting down when you say to the dog, “sit”; or the dog goes on its back and turns around, what we would say, “roll over,” the dog rolls over.  “To roll over” means the dog lays on the ground and turns on the other side and then gets up. Well, these are tricks that you might teach a dog.  There's a(n) old expression in English, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” which means if you are a person who is older or if you have been doing something the same way for a long time, it's more difficult for you to learn to do something new, something different.

Boris says that he'd “probably just retire and buy” himself a “new house.”  “To retire,” as a verb,  means to stop working, to quit your job and to live on the money that you have saved.  Daniela says, “Yeah, that sounds nice.  I suppose I’d have a lot of family and friends asking for money.”  “I suppose” means something similar to “I would guess” or “it is likely that.”  “I suppose I’d have a lot of family and friends asking for money;” it is likely, or it is probable that I would have a lot of friends asking for money.

 Boris says, “I know I would” meaning I know I would have a lot of family asking for money.  “I can just see them coming out of the woodwork.”  “To come out of the woodwork,” all one word, is an expression we use when people who normally you don't see or don't talk to suddenly start to call you or to talk to you because you have some money, or you have something that they want.  “The woodwork” is any part of the room that has wood, the walls or the windows.  So when someone says, “they are coming out of the woodwork,” it means they are coming from everywhere.  Boris says his friends and family will start to pester him.  “To pester,” as a verb, means to bother.  So to pester someone is to bother them, to constantly ask them questions, or to call them, for example.

Boris says, “Maybe winning the lottery isn’t such a good thing.”  And Daniela says, “You’re right.  It’s a curse.”  A “curse” is a bad thing that happens to you. So Daniela makes a joke here and says, “When you win, you can give me all of the money.”  Boris replies, “Yeah, right” meaning “no.”  When you say, “Yeah, right” in a certain intonation, like “Yeah, right,” that means that you are telling the person “No, absolutely not.”  Boris finally says, “Don’t hold your breath!”  “Don’t hold your breath.”  To hold your breath is to stop breathing, to go, for example, when you are going into the water, you may hold your breath.  Well, when you say to someone, as an expression, “Don’t hold your breath” means you shouldn't expect that to happen.  That's not going to happen.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Daniela:  I got our lottery tickets during my lunch break.  The jackpot is up to $168 million dollars.  Imagine if we won.

Boris:  Thanks for getting mine, too.  When is the drawing?

Daniela:  Saturday at 6 PM.  It’s being televised on Channel 4.

# Placing a Business Order

# An Unwanted House Guest

complete transcript of this program.

Today's topic is “An Unwanted Houseguest.”  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

About a month ago, my friend Richard called me and asked if he could come stay with me for a couple of weeks.  I usually don't like having houseguests but Richard was a good friend.  He's an artist and he was thinking about moving to LA.  He wanted to see if he could get a job in the area.  I told him, yes, of course, and he came down right away.  As I said, that was a month ago.  He's been living in my guestroom ever since.

I like Richard and we get along, but I just don't like having a roomma te. Sometimes he gets in the way when I want to invite someone over and he's always hogging the couch.  One of my pet peeves is a dirty bathroom and Richard is a slob.  I finally decided to let him know that he had overstayed his welcome.  But, how do you throw out one of your best friends?

On the day I was going to talk to Richard, he came home with some big news. He had met some guy at the employment agency and he planned to move in with him.  I was bowled over!  He had just met him.  I tried to talk him out of it, but he'd made up his mind.  Richard has always been a free spirit so who am I to tell him what to do?  I just hope he'll be happy.

[End of story]

 This podcast is called, “An Unwanted Houseguest.” When someone is unwanted, “unwanted,” that means that no one wants them.  To be wanted would be, of course, the opposite.  I hope you are wanted, for example, by someone.  A “houseguest,” which is two words put together as one word, house, “house,” and guest, “guest,” a houseguest is someone who is staying at your house, someone who is visiting you and sleeping at your house for maybe, a day, a week, a month.  Those would be people we would call houseguests.

Well, our story begins by me saying that, “about a month ago my friend Richard called me and asked if he could stay with me for a couple of weeks.”  So, Richard called me on the telephone and asked if he could live at my house for a couple of weeks.  “To stay with (someone),” in this case, means that you are sleeping in their house or in their apartment.  It doesn't mean that you are just visiting for an hour or two.  It means that you are actually living there for some time.  I say in the story that “I usually don't like having houseguests,” that's true actually, “but Richard was a good friend.  He's an artist and was thinking about moving” here to Los Angeles.  Everyone who moves to Los Angeles is an artist or thinks they're an artist!

Well, my friend Richard wanted to find a job here in L.A.  I told him that “Yes, of course” he could stay with me, and he came to my house.  “As I said, that was a month ago.”  The expression, “as I said,” is when you are telling a story and you mention something - you talk about something and then you may go and talk about something else and then you want to go back and continue your story, you may use this expression, “as I said.”  So, I'm reminding you that it was a month ago that Richard came to stay at my house.

“He's been living in my guestroom ever since.”  My guestroom, “guestroom,” all one word, is a place in a house, a room in a house that no one sleeps in normally.  It's an extra room with a bed so that when you have guests they can sleep in your guestroom.  My guests, at my house, usually sleep in the garage, that way they won't stay very long.

Now, I say in the story that “I like Richard, and we get along.”  To get along, “along,” means that we're friends, we don't argue with each other, we're nice to each other, we're polite to each other.  But, I say that I “don't like having a roomma te,” and sometimes Richard “gets in the way when I want to invite someone over.”  To get in the way, “way,” means that you are interfering; you are preventing someone from doing something they want to do, usually because you

 are in their house, or in some space, their office, for example, that they want to do something.

I say that Richard it is “always hogging the couch.”  To hog, “hog,” is a informal word - verb -that means to use something and not let anyone else use it.  So, I sit on the couch and I don't let my wife sit next to me - I'm hogging the couch.  A hog, “hog,” is a pig.  “Oink, oink,” would be the noise for a pig.  And, the verb, to hog, means that you are using something and not letting anyone else use it.

Well, “One of my pet peeves,” “pet peeves,” two words, pet peeves, “is a dirty bathroom.”  A pet peeve is something that makes you angry; one specific thing that you don't like that bothers you, that always gets you mad.  To peeve someone off means to make someone mad.  So, when we say it's my pet peeve, we mean that it's something that bothers me especially.  Maybe not other people around me, but it bothers me.  So, a pet peeve can be, for example, that you hate when someone knocks at your door trying to sell something to you, which happens all the time to me here in Los Angeles.  People are constantly coming to the door, knocking and wanting to sell things.  Well, one of my pet peeves is being bothered by these people.  So, it's something that bothers you.

Well, one thing that bothers me in the story “is a dirty bathroom,” and unfortunately, “Richard is a slob.”  A slob, “slob,” is, again, an informal word, which means someone who is not very neat, someone who makes a mess, someone who, for example, leaves their clothes on the floor and doesn't wash their dishes when they are done eating - that would be a slob.  We might also call that person a pig, “pig,” like the animal, but that's a little stronger.  A slob is still, however, not a nice word.  You do not want your wife calling you a slob.  That would not be good.

“I finally decided to” tell Richard that he has “overstayed his welcome.”  To overstay, “overstay,” one word, means to stay at someone's house or apartment longer than you should.  The expression is normally to overstay your welcome, “welcome,” meaning you are staying too long.  I welcome you into my house means I'm nice to you, I say yes, please come to my house, but then you stay much too long.  That's overstaying your welcome, kind of what my relatives do sometimes.  So, “how do you throw out one of your best friends?”  To throw, “throw,” out, “out,” two words, means to get rid of, to take someone and remove them from your house.  To get rid of them is another way of saying that.

 Well, “On the day I was going to talk to Richard,” and tell him “that he had overstayed his welcome,” he came home and told me that he had met someone “at the employment agency, and he planned to move in with him.”  The employment agency is a place, usually run by the government, where they have jobs - a list of jobs that you can look at.  The expression to move in, “move in,” two words, means that you are going to live with someone.  So, “I met a good friend and we decided to move in together,” we're going to live in the same apartment or the same house.”

I was very surprised that Richard said this, “I was bowled over!”  To be bowled, “bowled,” over, “over,” means to be very surprised, to be shocked.  You can't believe it, it's so incredible.  That's to be bowled over, like someone is knocking you down.  We sometimes use that expression “he almost bowled me over,” meaning he almost knocked me down.  The sports is called bowling, “bowling,” and there's a verb, to bowl.  And, bowling is when you have a round ball, you throw it on the ground and then it hits, what we call in English, the pins, “pins,” which are these white objects that you try to hit all the pins so that they fall down. Well, that's where is the expression, to be bowled over, means.  Here, it means to be surprised.

Well, I tried to talk Richard out of moving in with this person.  “To talk (someone) out of (something)” means to try to convince or persuade them that they are wrong, to try to get them to change their decision, to change their mind.  But, Richard had “made up his mind.”  To make up your mind means to make a decision and usually it's your final decision.  You think about it and then you say, “yes, this is what I'm going to do.”

“Richard has always been a free spirit.”  A free spirit, “spirit,” is someone who doesn't like to do things the way everyone else does, someone who does things differently.  And, I say in the story, “who am I to tell him what to do?”  That expression, who am I to tell you something, means it is not my place, it is not my right, I should not be telling you what to do.

Well, I will tell you what to do right now: Listen to the dialogue at a native rate of speech.

 [Start of story]

About a month ago, my friend Richard called me and asked if he could come stay with me for a couple of weeks.  I usually don't like having houseguests but Richard was a good friend.  He's an artist and he was thinking about moving to LA.  He wanted to see if he could get a job in the area.  I told him, yes, of course, and he came down right away.  As I said, that was a month ago.  He's been living in my guestroom ever since.

I like Richard and we get along, but I just don't like having a roomma te. Sometimes he gets in the way when I want to invite someone over and he's always hogging the couch.  One of my pet peeves is a dirty bathroom and Richard is a slob.  I finally decided to let him know that he had overstayed his welcome.  But, how do you throw out one of your best friends?

# At an Amusement Park

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 195, “At an Amusement Park.”  You're listening to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 195.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com where you can find a complete Learning Guide for this podcast.  It will give you all of the vocabulary, definitions, new vocabulary, cultural information and a complete transcript of this podcast.  Today's podcast is about having fun at an amusement park.  Let's go!  [Start of story]  My brother, his wife, and their two daughters are in town and I had promised the girls that I would take them to an amusement park.  I don’t really like roller coasters, but I knew the kids would like it.    On Saturday morning, we drove down to the theme park.  We parked and took a shuttle to the park entrance.  We looked at the ticket prices and decided to buy a day pass for each of us.  Maria, the younger of the two kids, is only 2-years-old, and children under three get in free.    The first thing we did was stand in line for the biggest attraction in the park: a really big roller coaster.  Actually, only Grace and I stood in line since Maria was too young to ride it.  My brother and my sister-in-law took Maria to ride the Ferris wheel and carousel, and afterwards, we planned to meet near the concession stands so we could watch the parade at 2 o’clock.  Grace and I finally made it to the head of the line and we got on the ride.  I really don’t like roller coasters.  When we got off, I felt queasy and had to sit down for a few minutes before I could walk again.    All in all, we had a good day at the amusement park. But, it will be long time before I go on a roller coaster again! ESL Podcast  195 – At an Amusement Park  [End of story]  Today's podcast is called, “At an Amusement Park.”  An amusement park, “amusement,” park, “park,” is a place where they have lots of fun things to do, usually there are lots of rides.  A ride, “ride,” in an amusement park means that these are machines that you can get on and they'll take you up and down and all around, you can go in circles.  There are lots of different machines that we call, in an amusement park, a ride.  So, a ride is a fun thing that you do in an amusement park.    An example of a ride would be a roller coaster, “roller coaster.”  A roller coaster is a ride where you usually sit in a little - looks like a little car; it's a very small space where you sit.  There are lots of these little cars that are connected, and you go on what looks to be a mountain or a hill that goes up and down, up and down, and you ride it like you would on a train, except it goes up and down and around.  A roller coaster is an example of a ride at an amusement park.  In our story, I say that, “My brother, his wife, and their two daughters are in town,” meaning they are visiting us from another town.  I live in Los Angeles; they live in St. Paul/Minneapolis area of the state of Minnesota, so when they visit and stay here, we say they are in town.  Well, they're “in town and I had promised the girls” - the two daughters, my - what we would call nieces, “nieces,” those are the daughters of my brother's family.  The boy would be called a nephew, “nephew.”  Well, I took my two nieces to the amusement park.  “I don’t really like roller coasters,” I said, “but I knew” that “the kids would like it.”  So, “On Saturday morning we drove to the theme park.”  A theme, “theme,” park is a type of amusement park.  It's usually an amusement park that has one special, or one particular idea - one main idea for the park.  This could be, for example, Disneyland or Disney World.  Disneyland is here in Southern California; Disney World is in Florida - the state of Florida, and there are other Disney theme parks in different cities.  There's one outside of Paris; there's one in Hong Kong. And these are amusement parks where everything is based on, or comes from a Disney cartoon or a Disney movie that is famous and people will recognize.  You can also have an amusement park that is not a theme park, that you'd go to and there are just lots of fun rides, but there isn't any particular main idea.  A main idea is also called a theme, and that's why we have the word theme park.  We went to “the theme park.  We parked and took a shuttle to the park entrance.”  A shuttle, “shuttle,” is a small bus that takes people a very short distance, usually ESL Podcast  195 – At an Amusement Park  from one part the parking lot to the place where you go into the park, what we would call the entrance, “entrance.”  So, a shuttle can take you from a parking lot to the airport, or it could take you from one side of a university campus to another side of a college or university campus.  A shuttle can also be what we call a van, “van,” which is a big car that you can put, maybe, seven, eight, ten people in.  If it's bigger, it would probably be called a bus.  Well, we took the shuttle to the entrance, and that's the place where you buy your ticket, usually, and walk into the park.  We use that word, entrance, for a park, but you could also use it for a building or for anywhere where you have to go into something, that would have an entrance, the place where you enter.  We went into the park entrance and we looked at the price of the ticket, that would be the ticket that would get us into the park, and we “decided to buy a day pass for each of us.”  A day pass, “pass,” is the same as a ticket for the whole day.  You could also buy a month pass, or a monthly pass, and that would get you into the park every day for one month.  My brother's youngest daughter was only two-years-old, so she got in for free, or she got in free.  To get in free means you do not have to pay any money, and for many parks and other places, children under five, or under three, sometimes even under 12-years-old - they are less than 12-years-old - don't have to pay in order to enter into the park and use it.  The same is true in a theater, for example.  Some movie theaters, you get in free if you are less than a certain age.  Well, “The first thing we did” is “stand in line for the biggest attraction in the park.”  To stand in line means that you wait with other people in a line.  In Great Britain this is called queuing; to queue means to stand in line.  The attraction is one of the interesting things about the park, so a theme park like Disneyland has many attractions.  There are the rides, but there are also shows and other things that happen in the theme park that could be called attractions.  Well, the biggest attraction was the roller coaster, and so one of my nieces, Grace and I, we “stood in line, and my brother and sister-in-law took Maria,” my younger niece, “to ride the Ferris wheel and the carousel.”  I said that it was “my brother and my sister-in-law;” my sister-in-law is my brother's wife.  So, my sister-in-law and my brother took Maria to the Ferris wheel.  Ferris wheel, “Ferris wheel,” two words, is a ride that you sit in a little car, but the whole thing is like a big circle.  The circle goes around, and you go to the very top, so you're very high off the ground, and then the circle comes back around and you're at the bottom.  So, it's a round wheel that goes up into the air. ESL Podcast  195 – At an Amusement Park  A carousel is also a wheel, but it's a wheel that is completely on the ground.  You don't go up; you just go around in a circle.  Carousels, which are also sometimes called merry-go-rounds, “merry-go-round,” a carousel or a merry-go-round is a wheel that goes around.  Usually, there are fake horses - plastic horses that the little children can sit on, and the horses go up and down, just one or two feet, as the wheel goes around.  That's a carousel.  After, we had decided that we would go to “the concession stands so we could watch the parade at two o'clock.”  A concession stand, “concession,” stand, “stand,” is a place in a amusement park, or at a baseball or football stadium where you can buy food and something to drink.  A parade, “parade,” is when you have people who walk down the street; usually they are dressed to look like someone.  Sometimes you have musical bands, in a parade, that are playing music, and you sit on the side of the street and you watch them walk down the street in front of you.  Well, Grace and I - my niece and I - were waiting in the line and we “finally made it to the head of the line.”  To make it to the head of the line means you are in the front or you are the person that is now able to buy their ticket - you are at the front of the line.  Well, “we got on the roller coaster,” and I said, “I don't like roller coasters.  When we got off” the roller coaster - when we exited the roller coaster, “I felt queasy.”  To feel queasy, “queasy,” means that you feel sick, like you might vomit, “vomit,” or throw up, which means that what's in your stomach comes out of your mouth.  Not a very nice thing!  But, that's if you feel queasy, you feel that you might have to vomit, or you might have to throw up, so your stomach doesn't feel very good.  If you eat 25 hot dogs at one dinner, you might feel a little queasy, for example.  I end the story by saying, “All in all, we had a good day.”  All in all means considering everything.  If we think about the whole day, or the whole situation, we had a good time.  Now, let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech.  [Start of story]  My brother, his wife, and their two daughters are in town and I had promised the girls that I would take them to an amusement park.  I don’t really like roller coasters, but I knew the kids would like it. ESL Podcast  195 – At an Amusement Park   On Saturday morning, we drove down to the theme park.  We parked and took a shuttle to the park entrance.  We looked at the ticket prices and decided to buy a day pass for each of us.  Maria, the younger of the two kids, is only 2-years-old, and children under three get in free.    The first thing we did was stand in line for the biggest attraction in the park: a really big roller coaster.  Actually, only Grace and I stood in line since Maria was too young to ride it.  My brother and my sister-in-law took Maria to ride the Ferris wheel and carousel, and afterwards, we planned to meet near the concession stands so we could watch the parade at 2 o’clock.  Grace and I finally made it to the head of the line and we got on the ride.  I really don’t like roller coasters.  When we got off, I felt queasy and had to sit down for a few minutes before I could walk again.    All in all, we had a good day at the amusement park. But, it will be long time before I go on a roller coaster again!  [End of story]

# A Business Plan

complete transcript of this episode.

Today's episode is about starting a new business with a business plan.  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

About a year ago, I came up with an idea that I thought would revolutionize the way people sell their goods on the Internet.  After a lot of planning, I decided to try to attract investors by developing a business plan.  I got some advice from my friend Steve who is a very successful entrepreneur.

First, he told me I needed to figure out my business model.  How would my investors make money?  How long would it take for the company to be in the black?  Steve said that the proposal would need to show revenue projections for the first five years, and that I should give an estimate of gross sales for that same period.

Steve also said that I should include what I thought was the target market for the new service and my plan for convincing potential buyers that the new service would give them a competitive advantage.

After working on the plan for a few months, I thought it was ready to show to some prospective investors.  All I need is just one big investor to take a chance on it.  Hopefully, this time next year, I’ll be well on my way to building a new business empire.

 [End of story]

This podcast is called “A Business Plan.”  A business plan is a document of several pages that describes what your new business is and how you are going to make money.  And, if you are starting a new business, it is always a good idea to have a plan: how are you going to make money, what do you need and so forth.  If you want other people to give you, or to lend you money for your business, they will usually ask for your business plan.

Well, in today's story we begin by saying that, “About a year ago, I came up with an idea.”  To come up with an idea means that you think of - that you imagine an idea.  Well, “I came up with an idea that I thought would revolutionize the way that people sell their goods on the Internet.”  To revolutionize, “revolutionize,” means to completely change.  The word, revolution, as a noun, is when there is a complete or radical change, often in the way that a government is run, but we also use the term for any big or major change in something we can use that term, revolution; well, this is the verb, to revolutionize.

I want to revolutionize the way people sell their goods, “goods,” on the Internet. Their goods are the things that they are selling, such as computers, or cups, or telephones.  Anything physical that you sell is a good.  The other kind of thing you can sell is a service, “service.”  A service is something you do for someone; it isn't something you can give them physically.

Well, I am trying to “revolutionize the way people sell their goods,” their products would be another term, “on the Internet.  After a lot of thinking and planning, I decided to try to attract investors.”  To attract, “attract,” means to try to get - to try to bring to you.  An investor, “investor,” is someone who gives you money for your business, usually someone who expects that they will get a percentage of the profits from your company.  So, if I give someone 100,000 dollars, and that is fifty percent of what it cost to start the business, I expect fifty percent of the profit - of the money that the business makes after it becomes successful.

Well, investors want to see a business plan, so I decided to get “some advice from my friend Steve,” Steve “is a very successful entrepreneur,” “entrepreneur.” Entrepreneur is originally a French word, and in English it means someone who is good at starting new businesses - someone who likes to start their own business.  Usually, these are small businesses, but sometimes they become

 bigger as they become more successful.  So, an entrepreneur is a, usually, small businessperson who likes to start new businesses.

Well, my friend Steve told me that “I needed to figure out,” or to think of, “my business model.”  The term, business model, “model,” means the way that you are going to be able to make money: how are you going to make money on something, who are you going to sell your product, your good or your service to and how will you do that; that is your business model - how you will make money.

Back about five - six years ago, there were many entrepreneurs on the Internet who started companies that were not successful, and one reason was that they did not have a good business model.  They didn't know how they were going to make money on the Internet.  I don't know either!

One question that my business plan has to answer is “How long will it take for” my “company to be in the black?”  When we say a company is in the black, we mean they are making money; they are taking in more money than they are spending, or what we would call a profit, “profit.”  If you are in the black, you are making money; you are getting a profit from your business.  The opposite is to be in the red.  If you're in the red, you are losing money on your business.  Of course, you can't be in the red for too long because you will no longer have any money left.

Well, Steve said that the proposal that I was trying to put together needed “to show revenue projections.”  The proposal, which is the same as the business plan, needed “to show revenue projections.”  To show, “show,” here means that it would have to be in the business plan; it would have to be on a piece of paper that said what the revenue projections were.

What are revenue projections?  Well, revenue, “revenue,” is another word for the money that you get - that people give you for your product or service, that's your revenue.  The opposite of revenue is expenses.  Expenses, “expenses,” is the money that you have to spend - to give other people to make your product, or to run your service business.  A projection, “projection,” is a prediction; it's what you think will happen.  So, a revenue projection is your guess about how much money you will be able to get for your good or your service.

My proposal has to have “revenue projections for the first five years,” of my business and I also need an estimate of the gross sales for that period.  An

 estimate, “estimate,” is similar to a projection.  It's a guess; it's what I think something will be.  Your gross, “gross,” sales, “sales,” is the amount of your product or your service that you sell, not including the refunds or other returns that people might have.  So, for example, if I am selling ten staplers, and I sell ten and I make 100 dollars, that would be my gross sales.  But, one of my customers might want a refund - a return of the stapler, and so I would have to give them ten dollars back - each stapler is ten dollars, let's say.  So, your gross sales are the 100 dollars before any returns or refunds to your customers.

Steve also said that I need to think about the target market for my new service. A target, “target,” market, “market,” are the customers that you are going to sell your goods and services to.  A market here just means the people who will buy your product.  When we say a target market, we mean the market that is specifically for what you are selling.

In the story, it says that I have to have a plan to convince “potential buyers that the new service” that I am going to give them, “would give them a competitive advantage.” A buyer, “buyer,” is someone who buys; it's a noun for someone who buys your product or service.  A potential buyer, “potential,” is someone who might buy your product, but they haven't bought it yet.  So, your potential buyers is the same as your potential customers - people who will buy your product or service.

Well, I have to convince people who may be interested in my service that I will give them a competitive advantage.  A competitive, “competitive,” advantage, “advantage,” means that they will do better in their own business if they use my service.  So, an advantage here means something that will help you be better than other people, and competitive advantage means that you will be able to sell more, for example, of your product if you buy my service.

After working on my plan, I decided to show it to some prospective investors. Prospective, “prospective,” is the same as potential - investors who might want to give me money.  “All I need is just one big investor to take a chance on it.”  The expression, to take a chance on something, means that you aren't sure if it's going to work, but you are going to gamble.  You are going to guess that it might work, and so you try it, even though you don't know if it will work.  That is to take a chance on something.

 “Hopefully, this time next year,” meaning by this same date next year, so if it's September in 2006, by September 2007, “I’ll be well on my way to building a new business empire.”  The expression, to be well on your way, means that you will have made significant progress; you will be very close to your goal or your objective - what you are trying to do.

Well, my goal is to have a business empire.  An empire, “empire,” is a large company, which has many, many different offices or sells many, many different things.  The opposite of an empire would be the Center for Educational Development!

Now, let's listen to the story, this time at a native rate of speech.

# An Apology

complete transcript of this podcast.

Today's podcast is about someone who is making an apology, saying that they are sorry to another person.  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

Becky:  Curt.

Curt:  Oh, hi.

Becky:  Can I talk to you for a minute?

Curt:  I’m really busy right now.

Becky:  Just one minute.  I promise it won’t take long.

Curt:  Okay.  Let’s talk over here.

Becky:  Curt, I’m really sorry that I told Joyce that you had a crush on her.  We were just talking last Friday and it just slipped out.

Curt:  But, I told you about Joyce in confidence.

Becky:  I know.  It’s totally my fault.  I really regret saying anything.  I wish I could take it back.  I just want you to know that I’m really sorry and I hope that you’ll accept my apology.

 Curt:  What’s done is done.  I was really pissed off when I found out this morning but I’m over it now.  [cell phone ring]  Hold on a sec.  [long pause, muttering in background]  Guess who that was?

Becky:  Who?

Curt:  Joyce.  She wanted to know if I’d like to have lunch with her today.

Becky:  It was?  That’s great, maybe…

Curt:  And, maybe not.  Maybe she just wants to tell me she’s not interested in me.

Becky:  Or, maybe she likes you, too.

Curt:  Don’t let your imagination run away with you.

Becky:  I won’t but I’m keeping my fingers crossed.

[End of story]

This podcast is called, “An Apology.”  An apology, “apology,” is when you do something wrong and you tell the other person that you are sorry, that you feel badly and that you did not want to hurt them.  Those would be examples of an apology - to say that you are sorry.

Well, in this dialogue, we hear Becky and Curt talking.  Becky asks Curt if she can talk to him “for a minute.”  When we say the expression, for a minute, we mean for a short time, not necessarily 60 seconds.  Usually, it means for a very short time.  You wouldn't use it for things that would take a long time, such as apologizing to your wife or girlfriend.

Well, Curt doesn't seem to want to talk to Becky, he says, “I’m really busy right now.”  Becky says, “Just one minute,” meaning just a short amount of time, “I promise it won’t take long.”  To promise, “promise,” means that you make a commitment to another person.  You are saying that it will happen the way you say it will happen.  So, Becky promises Curt that “it won't take long,” their conversation won't take very much time.  Curt says, “Okay.  Let's talk over here.”

 Becky then apologizes to Curt.  She says, “Curt, I’m really sorry that I told Joyce you had a crush on her.”  To be sorry means that you regret doing something. It's part of the apology.  To have a crush, “crush,” on someone is when you are romantically interested in someone.  Often times we use this word, crush, to mean the very beginnings of your interest in someone else.  This is also a term we use sometimes with high school students or junior high school students. They have crushes; they're not in love, but they have romantic interest.

Becky then says that she and Joyce “were just talking last Friday and it just slipped out.”  Notice the use of the word just, “just,” here.  In the first case, “we were just talking,” means that we were only talking - we weren't doing anything else.  The second part of the sentence says, “it just slipped out.”  Here, just means it accidentally happened, or it happened without me wanted it to, or without me having that intention - I didn't necessarily want it to slip out.  The expression, to slip, “slip,” out, “out,” two words, means that you tell someone something that you didn't plan on telling them.  You weren't supposed to tell them; it was a secret, but you were talking and it slipped out.  You said it even though you wanted to keep it a secret.

Curt then says to Becky, “But, I told you about Joyce in confidence.”  In confidence, “confidence,” means that I told you as a secret; I told you something as a secret that you did not want them to tell anyone else.  So, when someone tells you something in confidence, it means that they don't want you to tell anyone else.

Becky says, “I know.  It’s totally my fault.”  Totally, here, means it's completely my fault.  It's somewhat of an informal use.  It started out as something that you would only hear young people say - high school students - but now it's more, becoming more commo n.  So, “it's totally my fault” means it's completely my fault.  Becky says, “I really regret saying anything.”  To regret, “regret,” means the same as you're sorry, that you wish it had not happened.  In fact, Becky says, “I wish I could take it back.”  To take something back means that you wish something didn't happen.  “I wish I could take it back,” I wish I had not said that. Becky says that, “I just want you to know that I’m really sorry and I hope that you’ll accept my apology.”  To accept an apology means to forgive the other person, to say, “it's okay, no problem,” when they apologize to you.

 Curt says, “What’s done is done.”  What's done is done means that we can't go back and change history.  We can't change what happened.  It's too late.  This expression, what's done is done, actually comes originally from Shakespeare, from the play “Macbeth,” when Lady Macbeth says, “What's done is done,” in the middle of the play.  Later, she also has a famous quote, “What's done cannot be undone,” meaning once you do something, you can't go back and change it.  So, Curt says, “What's done is done.  I was really pissed off,” he says, “when I found out this morning but I’m over it now.”  The expression, to be pissed, “pissed,” off, “off,” is an informal expression, not something you would say to your boss or perhaps your mother even, and it means that you are very angry, that you are very mad, something that you would use with a friend perhaps, that expression. It means that you are very angry.  Well, Curt was very angry, but he says, “I'm over it now.”  To be over something means that it no longer bothers you it.  “It's okay now, it doesn't matter to me.”

The cell phone then rings and Curt says, “Hold on a sec,” or he could have said, “Hold on a second.”  Hold on a sec or hold on a second means wait for a short amount of time.  When you say to someone, “hold on,” you mean wait, I'm busy, I'm doing something else right now; I will get back to you in a very short time, in a second.  A few seconds later, Curt comes back and says, “Guess who that was?” Guess who means I want you to guess, I want you to think of who that was talking to me.  Guess who that was?

Becky says, “Who?” and Curt says, “Joyce.”  It was Joyce on the telephone who called him.  She wanted to know if Curt wanted to have lunch with her today. Becky says, “It was?” meaning it was Joyce really.   “That's great, maybe...” and then Curt says, “And, maybe not.”  When Becky says, “maybe,” she's saying maybe she likes you, and Curt imme diately says, “And, maybe not.  Maybe she just wants to tell me she’s not interested in me.”  To be interested in someone means that you like them romantically, that you have a crush on them perhaps. “I'm interested in you,” means I am interested in you romantically.  Becky says, “Or, maybe she likes you, too,” and Curt says, “Don’t let your imagination run away with you.”  That means don't be thinking about things that may not happen; don't try to imagine something that isn't likely or isn't possible.

Becky says at the end, “I won’t,” meaning I won't let my imagination run away with me, “but I’m keeping my fingers crossed.”  To keep or to have your fingers crossed, “crossed,” means that you are hoping for something good to happen. To cross your fingers means to hope that something good will happen in the

 future.  “I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I will win the lottery this weekend.”  If I do win the lottery, there probably won't be an ESL Podcast next week, so if you hear one, I didn't win.

Now let's listen to the dialogue at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Becky:  Curt.

Curt:  Oh, hi.

Becky:  Can I talk to you for a minute?

Curt:  I’m really busy right now.

Becky:  Just one minute.  I promise it won’t take long.

Curt:  Okay.  Let’s talk over here.

Becky:  Curt, I’m really sorry that I told Joyce that you had a crush on her.  We were just talking last Friday and it just slipped out.

Curt:  But, I told you about Joyce in confidence.

Becky:  I know.  It’s totally my fault.  I really regret saying anything.  I wish I could take it back.  I just want you to know that I’m really sorry and I hope that you’ll accept my apology.

# A Love Letter

complete transcript of everything we say on this podcast.

Today's podcast is about someone who is writing a love letter.  Let's get started.

[Start of story]

Vicky:  What are you working on?

Issac:  If I tell you, will you promise not to laugh?

Vicky:  All right.  What is it?

Issac:  It’s a love letter to Julie.

Vicky:  Isn’t it a little premature?  You’ve only been going out for a month.

Issac:  Maybe, but I really want her to know how I feel.

Vicky:  Let me see it.  “Dear Julie.  I’m writing this letter to pour my heart out to you.  When we met, it was love at first sight and I can’t get you out of my head. You mean everything to me.  Now that we’re together, how can I ever live without you?”

Issac:  So, what do you think?

 Vicky:  I thought it would have some simple sweet nothings.  I didn’t expect it to be this heavy.

Issac:  Do you think it needs more terms of endearment?  Maybe I should have called her “my love,” “my darling,” or “sweetheart.”  Tell me the truth, do you think it’s too much?  I don’t want to scare her off.

Vicky:  Well, I know you’re head over heels in love with her, but if I were you, I’d play it by ear.  Give it to her when you feel the time is right.

Issac:  Okay, thanks.  I’ll try to play it cool, for now.

[End of story]

We heard a conversation between Vicky and Issac talking about a love letter. Vicky begins the dialogue by saying, “What are you working on,” meaning what are you doing, and Issac says, “If I tell you, will you promise not to laugh,” means if I tell you what I am doing, you have to say that you will not laugh at me.  To promise, “promise,” means to say that you will do something and that you will definitely do it.  You will commit yourself to doing it.

Vicky says, “All right.  What is it?”  What are you working on?  What are you doing?  Tell me.  Issac says, “It's a love letter to Julie.”  A love letter is a letter in which you tell someone that you love them, or tell them how much you love them, or why you love them.  These would all be considered love letters.  Some people like to write love letters.  Some people like to write poems and put them in your love letters.  Now, I guess, we would have love emails!

Vicky asks Issac if it isn't “a little premature.”  Premature, “premature,” means something that is before when you should be doing it.  Something that happens before it is supposed to happen or before it should happen.  We sometimes use this term to talk about babies who are born, and they may be born a week, or two weeks, or several weeks before they were expected.  These are called premature babies.  To do something prematurely means to do it before you should do it, before you are supposed to do something.  And what Vicky is saying here is that Issac is writing a love letter to Julie probably very soon after they first started going out.  In fact, she says, “You’ve only been going out for a month.” To go out means to be dating someone, to date someone.

 Issac says, “Maybe,” maybe it is a little early - and early is another word for premature - “but,” Issac says, “I really want her to know how I feel.”  And this, of course, is a very dangerous thing to do when you are dating someone for the first time.  That's just a little advice from Dr. McQ uillan!

Vicky says, “Let me see it,” meaning let me see the letter, I want to read it, and she then reads us the letter.  The letter begins, “Dear Julie.  I’m writing this letter to pour out my heart to you.”  To pour, “pour,” my heart out, or to pour out my heart, either way, means to tell you everything that I am thinking, to tell you my feelings, or to tell you everything that I am feeling.  This is something you would only want to do with someone who's a good friend or someone who you know very well because you may tell them things that are secret, things that you have not told anyone else.  So, this is to pour out your heart to someone.

The letter continues, “When we met, it was love at first sight.”  The expression, love at first sight, “sight,” means that we fell in love, or Issac fell in love, the first time that we saw each other.  Issac is saying that the first time he saw Julie he said, “Oh, I love her!”  That happens all the time, of course.  Issac continues in his letter, “I can’t get you out of my head.”  I can’t get you out of my head means I cannot stop thinking about you.  I am always thinking about you.  I am constantly thinking about you.  Issac says, “You mean everything to me.”  You mean everything to me means that you are the most important person in my life.  You are more important than anything else, except watching TV, of course!  Finally, Issac says, “Now that we’re together, how can I ever live without you?”  Oh, so romantic, Issac is!  To be romantic, “romantic,” means that you say nice things to someone.  You do nice things to someone who you love.

Issac asks Vicky, “what do you think?”  What do you think about what I wrote? What is your opinion?  And Vicky says, “I thought it would have some sweet nothings.”  Sweet, “sweet,” nothings, “nothings,” plural, is an expression that we use to describe nice things that you say someone who you love, but that are not too serious.  You could say, “You are the sunshine of my life,” or you could sing that: “You are the sunshine of my life, oh.”  That was a song by Stevie Wonder.  I used to sing that to all of the girls that I was interested in.  That's why I remained single for so many years!

Well, Vicky wants Issac, or expects Issac, to say sweet nothings, things that are nice, but they aren't too serious.  She says, “I didn't expect” your letter “to be this heavy.”  When we say something is heavy, “heavy,” we don't mean that it weighs

 a lot.  We mean that it's very serious.  This is an informal way of saying something is really serious.  You may go to a movie and say, “Wow, that was heavy.” It was very serious.  It's a older expression, but you will still hear it.

Issac says, “Do you think” my letter “needs more terms of endearment?”  Terms, “terms,” are words or phrases.  Endearment, “endearment,” are things that you say to make someone like you, things that you would say to someone who you are romantically interested in, for example.  So, terms of endearment would be things like, “my love,” Issac gives that as an example.  “My love,” “you are my love” - that would be a term of endearment.  It's a way of calling someone...a way of addressing someone.  It's the title or the name that you give them.  So, you could say, “my love.”  You could say, “my darling,” “darling.”  Darling is similar to my love, someone who I like very much.  Or, you could call someone “your sweetheart,” “sweetheart,” all one word.  To say someone is your sweetheart means that they are your girlfriend, or boyfriend, or someone who you are romantically interested in.  After you get married, of course, all of this goes away!

Well, Issac says, “Tell me the truth, do you think it’s too much?”  What he is asking here is do you think it is too serious.  When he says, “Do you think it's too much,” means is it more than what I should do?  Is it too heavy?  He finally says, “I don't want to scare her off.”  To scare, “scare,” someone off means that you frighten them.  In this case, he is being too serious, and for some girls, for some women, when you first started dating them if you are too serious too soon, you may scare them off.  That's true for men.  That's especially true for men!

“Well,” Vicky says, “I know you’re head over heels in love with her.”  The expression, to be head, “head,” over heels, “heels,” in love means that you love someone very much.  You're crazy about someone.  Vicky says, “but if I were you, I’d play it by ear.”  If I were you means if this were my situation, if I was the person in this situation - “I'd play it” - or I would “play it by ear.”  To play something by ear means to wait and see what happens.  You don't make any definite plans.  You wait and see what will happen, and then you act, or react, after you know what is going on.  So, someone may say to you, “Should we go to a movie on Friday night,” and you say, “Well, it might rain.  Let's play it by ear,” meaning let's wait and see if it rains and if it doesn't, we'll go to the movie.

Issac thanks Vicky and says, “I’ll try to play it cool.”  To play it cool, “cool,” means that I will try not to get too serious.  I will try not to seem like I'm too interested in

 Julie.  That, of course, is the trick gentlemen, that you don't seem too interested in the other person.  Ladies, they already know that!

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

[Start of story]

Vicky:  What are you working on?

Issac:  If I tell you, will you promise not to laugh?

Vicky:  All right.  What is it?

Issac:  It’s a love letter to Julie.

Vicky:  Isn’t it a little premature?  You’ve only been going out for a month.

Issac:  Maybe, but I really want her to know how I feel.

Vicky:  Let me see it.  “Dear Julie.  I’m writing this letter to pour my heart out to you.  When we met, it was love at first sight and I can’t get you out of my head. You mean everything to me.  Now that we’re together, how can I ever live without you?”

Issac:  So, what do you think?

Vicky:  I thought it would have some simple sweet nothings.  I didn’t expect it to be this heavy.

Issac:  Do you think it needs more terms of endearment?  Maybe I should have called her “my love,” “my darling,” or “sweetheart.”  Tell me the truth, do you think it’s too much?  I don’t want to scare her off.

Vicky:  Well, I know you’re head over heels in love with her, but if I were you, I’d play it by ear.  Give it to her when you feel the time is right.

Issac:  Okay, thanks.  I’ll try to play it cool, for now.

# Meeting a Deadline

Today's podcast is called, “Meeting a Deadline.”  Let's go!

[Start of story]

Pam:  You wanted to see me?

Ed:  Yes, I did.  Have a seat.  I want to talk to you about the Pulsen project.

Pam:  I know I’m a little late in getting that report to you, but I’ve been pulling out the stops to get it done.

Ed:  But it’s still not done, is it?   You know that the deadline for the next milestone of the project was this past Monday.

Pam:  Yes, I know, but the scope of the project turned out to be a lot bigger than I had anticipated.  And, they just didn’t allocate enough resources for something this size.  Is there any way we can push back the deadline by a week?

Ed:  The time to ask that was last week, not after you’ve missed the deadline.  I have the management breathing down my neck about this report.  I’ve tried to stall them for the past two days and they’re not happy.

Pam:  I promise to have it on your desk by tomorrow morning.  You have my word.

 Ed:  All right.  I’ll give you until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.  I’m tired of taking the heat, though, and I don’t plan to do it any longer.

Pam:  You can count on me.

Ed:  Don’t let me down.

Pam:  I won’t.

[End of story]

The title of this podcast is, “Meeting a Deadline.”  To meet, “meet,” a deadline means that you do what you are supposed to do before the time that it is due.  A deadline, “deadline,” all one word, is the day or date that you have to get something done.  It's the time that you must complete whatever you are told to complete.

Our dialogue begins with Pam saying to her boss Ed, “You wanted to see me?” This is the same as saying, “Did you want to see me?” but we use this expression, “You wanted to see me?” as a question when we are pretty sure that the person wants to see us, or that we know that they wanted to see us and we're just confirming, we're just checking, that that is true.  You could also say, “Did you want to see me?” if you weren't, perhaps, as certain, though these two expressions can also mean the same thing and be used in the same way.

Ed says, “Yes, I did.”  I did want to see you.  He tells Pam to, “Have a seat,” or to take a seat, meaning to sit down.  He wants to talk to Pam “about the Pulsen project,” and Pam says, “I know I’m a little late in getting that report to you.” What she means here is that she is late in delivering the report, or handing the report - the information - to her boss.  She's running late, we might say.  To run late is the same as to be late, in this case means that you are not getting things done when you should get them done.

Pam says that she's, “been pulling out the stops to get it done.”  The expression, to pull out the stops, “stops,” or to pull out all the stops, means that you are doing everything possible that you can to get something done.  This expression comes from the organ, as in a church.  An organ is a musical instrument that has long pipes that play different notes.  To pull out the stops means to use all of the pipes

 of the organ, and it's an expression here which generally means to do everything possible.

Ed says, “But it’s still not done, is it?”  He's telling Pam that she still has not finished the report, even though she has done everything possible, she says.  Ed says, “You know that the deadline for the next milestone of the project was this past Monday.”  Well, deadline, we already know, is when something has to be finished.  A milestone, “milestone,” all one word, is when you have a large project and there are several different parts to the project.  Each part of the project has its own timeline - when you are supposed to get something done for this part, for part B, for part C, and so forth.  Each of these parts would have its own milestone.  A milestone is when you have completed an important or significant part of the project.  So, a big project that takes three months may have a milestone for part A and then another milestone for part B and a third for part C. Ed says that the milestone deadline for the project, for this part of the project, “was this past Monday,” meaning it was the Monday that we just passed, the previous Monday.

Pam says, “Yes, I know, but the scope of the project turned out to be a lot bigger than I had anticipated.”  The scope, “scope,” means the range, or the amount, or the size of the project.  “Turned out to be a lot bigger.” When we say something turned out to be, we mean that the result was something that was different than what you may have expected.  Well, “the scope” of this “project turned out to be a lot bigger” - the size of it was bigger than I expected.  The word that Pam uses in the dialogue is anticipated, “anticipated.”  To anticipate, as a verb, means to expect, to think about something and how it will happen, what will happen in the future.  This is to anticipate.  And, she said that she expected was a smaller project.

She also complains, because Pam is really complaining to the boss - giving him excuses, reasons why she didn't finish the project.  She says that they “didn’t allocate enough resources for something this size.”  To allocate, “allocate,” is a verb that you will often hear in a business setting, and it means to give.  We often use this verb, to allocate, with the term resources.  A resource, “resource,” is anything that you can use to get something done.  And, in a business project resources would include people who could help with the project.  It might also include information you need to do a project.  It might include the amount of time that you have to finish the project.  It could be money that you need to complete the project.  All of these things are resources.  In general, a resource is

 something that you use to complete another task, to finish something else.  And, the term here that you will hear often is allocate resources, meaning that you need to give people what they need to finish the project.

Pam asks Ed if there is, “any way,” that is if it is possible to “push back the deadline by a week?”  To push, “push,” back a deadline means to move the deadline another week in the future.  Ed says, “The time to ask that was last week,” meaning you should have asked that last week, not now – “not after you've missed the deadline.”  To miss, “miss,” a deadline is the opposite of to meet or to make a deadline, when you don't finish what you are supposed to do by the day you are supposed to do it.

Ed says, “I have the management breathing down my neck.”  When we say someone is breathing down your neck, we mean that they are bothering you. They are waiting for something to get done and they are asking you about it all the time - “Is it finished yet?  Are you done yet?  Why haven't you completed it?” So, Ed is saying that his boss - and remember Ed is Pam's boss - his boss has been talking to him and asking him about the project, putting pressure on him to complete it, trying to hurry it up.

Ed says that he's “tried to stall them,” but “they're not happy.”  To stall, “stall,” someone means to delay them, to make them wait longer because usually you aren't finished doing what you're supposed to do.  So, if you take your car into the mechanic to get it fixed and the mechanic says, “It will be done by five o'clock this afternoon.”  You go at five o'clock and the car isn't done and the mechanic may say, “Oh well, I need to get some more things.  Why don't you come back tomorrow?” He's trying to stall you, to prevent you, or to delay you, from getting your car back.

Pam says that she promises to have the report on Ed's “desk by tomorrow morning.”  When we say we're going to have something on someone's desk we mean you're going to give it to them, you're going to deliver it to them.  Pam says, “You have my word.”  The expression, to have someone's word, means that the person is promising to do something.  They are committing to do something.  “You have my word.”  I am promising to do it.  Ed says okay, “I’ll give you until nine o'clock tomorrow.  I’m tired of taking the heat, though, and I don’t plan to do it any longer.”  To take the heat, “heat,” means to be the person who is being criticized or the person who is being blamed for something that is going wrong.  Ed is saying that the management - his bosses - have been bothering

 him, and he's the one who has to take the heat, who has to accept the responsibility.

Pam says, “You can count on me.”  To count, “count,” on someone means to depend on them.  And, Ed says, “Don't let me down.”  To let someone down means to disappoint them.  So, to count on someone means to depend or rely or trust someone to do something, and to let someone down means not to do that thing, not to do what you promised to do.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.

Ed:  Yes, I did.  Have a seat.  I want to talk to you about the Pulsen project.
