<img src="p11286.jpg" align=right><h2>Problem B: Conformity</h2>

Frosh commencing their studies at Waterloo have diverse interests,
as evidenced by their desire to take various combinations of courses from
among those available.
<p>
University administrators are uncomfortable with this situation, and
therefore wish to offer a <i>conformity prize</i> to frosh who choose
the most popular combination of courses.  How many frosh will win
the prize?
<p>
The input consists of several test cases followed by a line containing
0.  Each test case begins with an integer <i>1 &le; n &le; 10000</i>, the number of
frosh.  For each frosh, a line follows containing the course numbers
of five distinct courses selected by the frosh.  Each course number is
an integer between 100 and 499.
<p>
The <i>popularity</i> of a combination is the number of frosh selecting
exactly the same combination of courses.  A combination of courses
is considered <i>most popular</i> if no other combination has higher
popularity.  For each line of input, you should output a single line
giving the total number of students taking some combination of courses that
is most popular.
