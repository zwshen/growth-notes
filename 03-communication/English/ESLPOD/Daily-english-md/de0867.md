This episode is a dialog between Pamela and David a bout how we might describe physically attractive men and women – not me, in other words. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Pamela:  You know that your tongue is hanging out of your mouth, right?

David:  That’s because I’ve never seen so many beau tiful women in one place before.  Why have I never been to this beach before ?  Look at her!  She’s a hottie!

Pamela:  Isn’t that what you said about that woman over there?

David:  No, I said she’s a babe.  Look at the way s he sways when she walks.

Pamela:  Stop ogling her or her boyfriend or husban d is going to come over here.

David:  I’m not ogling.  I’m admiring the perfectio n of the female body.

Pamela:  You’re undressing her with your eyes.  Ave rt your gaze before you regret it.  Oh, wow!

David:  What?

Pamela:  Check out that guy over there.  Hello, Mr.  Tall, Dark, and Handsome!

David:  That pretty boy over there?  He’s too into himself.  Look at the way he’s posing so every woman on this beach can get a look at him.  He’s nothing but an exhibitionist.

Pamela:  And the women you’ve been ogling in the te eny tiny bikinis?

David:  Those women?  They’re just showing off what  God gave them!

[end of dialog]

Pamela begins by saying, “You know that your tongue  is hanging out of your mouth, right?” The expression “to have your tongue”  – which is, of course, inside of your mouth normally – “hanging out of your mouth ” means that you are sort of like a dog or an animal that sees food and, in reac tion to that, sticks his tongue out. The tongue comes out, indicating that he wants  that food – that he wants to eat that food.

Sometimes, this expression is used to describe men who see beautiful women or a beautiful woman and are sort of not aware that th ey are looking at them or that they are showing their interest in such an obvious way. Pamela is saying that about David. David says, “That’s because I’ve never  seen so many beautiful women in one place before. Why have I never been to  this beach before?”

So they are down by probably the ocean, or a lake t hat has a beach – a place, usually filled with sand, that people sit on in ord er to either sunbathe – that is, take in the sun and have it change the color of the ir skin, at least if they’re light- skinned like me – or to go swimming. And of course,  at beaches, people usually wear swimming gear or swimwear that reveals their b ody more than you would see almost anywhere else.

David says, “Look at her” – pointing to one particu lar girl – “she’s a hottie!” A “hottie” (hottie) is someone who’s very beautiful, very sexually attractive. Pamela says, “Isn’t that what you said about that woman ov er there?” David says, “No. I said she’s a babe.” A “babe” (babe) is a beautiful,  young, attractive woman. It really means the same as “hottie.” “Hottie” has a l ittle bit more of a sexual meaning. “Babe” is always a woman who’s very attrac tive. It’s a little older word – it was popular, I think, late 80’s and 90’s, a litt le less popular now but you’ll still hear it.

David says, “Look at the way she sways when she wal ks.” “To sway” (sway) means to move your body from side to side. And, of course, a woman walking

down the street may sometimes sway her body natural ly from side to side and men often find that attractive, in the way that a w oman might be walking.

Pamela says, “Stop ogling her or her boyfriend or h usband is going to come over here.” “To ogle” (ogle) – which some people might p ronounce “oogle” like “Google,” but “ogle” is the standard pronunciation – means to look at someone, usually a man looking at a woman, but it could be t he other way around, with a strong sense of sexual attraction. You’re staring a t them. You’re looking at them for what would be considered too long of a period t o be polite. It might make the other person even uncomfortable, the way you are lo oking at them because you find them so beautiful, so attractive. That’s why P am tells David to stop ogling her. Stop looking at her that way, or if he doesn’t , the woman’s boyfriend or husband may come over here and, of course, not be v ery happy that David is looking at his girlfriend or wife.

David says, “I’m not ogling. I’m admiring the perfe ction of the female body.” I’m just admiring the beauty, her physical beauty. Pame la says, “You’re undressing her with your eyes.” “To undress” means to take you r clothes off. It’s the opposite of “to dress.” “To undress a person” – someone – “w ith your eyes” means that you are looking at that person who has clothes on, but you’re imagining them without their clothes. I think you understand what I’m saying here. That’s what David is doing according to Pamela. He’s not lookin g at this woman as some sort of work of art. He’s looking at her in a very sexua l way.

Pamela says, “Avert your gaze before you regret it. ” “To avert” (avert) means to avoid or to turn away. Your “gaze” (gaze) is your l ook. You’re looking at someone. You’re gazing at someone. “Avert your gaze ,” means to turn your eyes away from someone. Don’t look at something. We migh t say this if it’s something particularly ugly or negative or violent. In this c ase, we’re saying it to David because he might get in trouble if he keeps looking  at this beautiful woman who obviously has a man with her.

Then Pamela says, “Oh, wow.” David says, “What?” Pa m says, “Check out that guy over there.” “Check out” here is a two-word, ph rasal verb, meaning to look at and pay attention to someone or something. “Check o ut this new television show,” you might say to someone, and show them on y our television what you’re talking about. “Check out that guy” means look at t hat man over there.

“Guy” usually, in the singular, refers to a man. “G uys” (guys) – plural – can refer to a group of men or it could refer to a group of m en and women. So it depends on how you use it. A lot of people will say, “Hey g uys! How’s it going?” – referring to both men and women. But if you say, “He’s with a  guy,” you mean he’s with a

man, not a woman. So, “guy,” in the singular, is us ually a man. “Guys” can be men or men and women.

Getting back to the story then, Pamela is looking a t some guy – some man – and she says, “Hello Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome.” The  expression “tall, dark, and handsome” describes the perfect man that many women  are looking for – a man who’s tall, a man who has perhaps dark skin and dar k eyes – although, of course, not all women like men with dark skin and d ark eyes, fortunately for me, since I have neither. “Handsome” (handsome) is a wa y of describing a man who’s very physically attractive. A good looking ma n would be described as “handsome.” We wouldn’t typically use handsome to d escribe a woman or a girl. Usually, it’s just for a boy or a man.

David says, “That pretty boy over there? He’s too i nto himself.” A “pretty boy” (pretty) boy is a man who takes care of his physica l appearance, who probably spends a lot of time and money on his hair and on h is clothing. Some men, of course, think that other men who do that are someho w too much concerned about their physical appearance. A real man doesn’t  worry about how his hair looks – that would be the idea. I don’t worry about  how my hair looks, for example. “Pretty boy” is used here, somewhat, as an  insult to this man. “He’s too into himself,” David says. “To be into yourself” me ans to be very interested in what you are doing, in your appearance, almost to t he point of being very selfish or self-centered. “I only care about me” – that’s t he idea behind this phrase, “to be into yourself.”

David says, “Look at the way he’s posing so every w oman on the beach can get a look at him.” “To pose” (pose) means, here, to po sition your body in a particular way, usually for a photograph so that you appear mo re beautiful. You may turn one way or another – turn your face or your head fr om one side to another. That would be to pose. This man is posing, according to David, so that all the other women on the beach can look at him.

He says, “He’s nothing but an exhibitionist.” An “e xhibitionist” (exhibitionist) is someone who wants to be noticed by other people, wh o does things so that other people pay attention to him or her. Some people eve n go so far as to take off part of their clothing so that other people will notice them. That’s usually the connection we have to this word. An exhibitionist i s often someone who will try to get other people to pay attention to them by taking  their clothes off.

Pamela says, “And the women you’ve been ogling in t he teeny tiny bikinis?” Pamela is saying that the women that David has been  looking at are also exhibitionists because they have “teeny tiny bikini s.” A “bikini” (bikini) is a small,

“two-piece” we would call it, bathing suit for wome n. The top part of the bathing suit goes around a woman’s chest or breasts and the  bottom part goes where she would wear a pair of underwear. “Teeny tiny” me ans very small. So, these bikinis are not very big, relative to the women who  are wearing them. That is, you can see a lot of their skin.

David says, “Those women? They’re just showing off what God gave them.” “To show off” is a two-word, phrasal verb meaning to ma ke something visible to other people so they can admire it, so they can see how b eautiful it is. We can also use this expression when we tell people things about ou rselves that we want to impress them with. “Oh, I just won a Nobel Prize in  literature, didn’t I tell you?” You are showing off. You are telling other people a bout your accomplishments or you’re showing them something physically that you want them to admire. You want them to say, “Oh, well that’s very beautiful,”  or “That’s very impressive. Congratulations on your Nobel Prize for literature. ”

“What God gave someone” is a phrase that we use to describe your natural abilities or your physical appearance. So when Davi d says that the women are just showing off what God gave them, he’s saying th at the women are just showing the world the gifts, if you will, that God has given them in creating their beautiful bodies. I think that’s what David is trying to say here.

Now let’s listen to the dialog, this time, at a nor mal speed.

She never shows off but God did give her a wonderfu l talent for writing scripts. I speak of our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.
