Your task in this problem is to find out the classification of volleyball
teams in a cup, and also the best teams according to some criterias.
</p>

<p>
You will be given a number of cups, each one with some teams competing.
Then, you will be given the matches and their results. A team win a match
if it has won <b>3</b> sets. There will at most <b>5</b> sets per match.
There are no draws. A team wins a set if it has made 25 or more points and
the other team is at least two points behind.
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The input consists of several cups. Each cup is to be considered alone.
Each cup description begins with a line indicating the number of teams
competing in that cup, <b>2 &lt; T &lt; 1000</b>. Than, <b>T</b> lines will
follow, each one with the name of one team competing in this cup. Team names
are <b>20</b> character or less and may contain spaces and letters.
</p>

<p>
Following, there will be a line with <b>1 &lt; M &lt; 1000</b> indicating
the number of matches already played on this cup. The next <b>M</b> lines
will have the description of a single match. Each match description begins with
the name of both teams of that match separated by a single dash (<b> - </b>).
Following the name of the second team there will be a collon (<b> : </b>).
After the name of the teams it will follow the descriptions of the sets played on the
match. A set will have the total points of the first team on the set, than
a single dash, than the total points of the second team.
</p>

<p>
The input is terminated with a cup where <b>T = 0</b>. This case is not
to be considered. Each cup is separated by a blank line.
</p>

<p>
See sample input for the correct format of the input.
</p>

</ul>
