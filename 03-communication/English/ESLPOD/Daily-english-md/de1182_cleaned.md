On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue abo ut trying to find a place to park your car. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Alan: We have to find a parking space. Let’s drive around the block one more time. Did you say that the restaurant we’re going t o has no off-street parking at all? 

Sasha: None. When I called the restaurant earlier t oday, I was told they have ample street parking. 

Alan: Obviously not on a Saturday night. Look, ther e’s a space! 

Sasha: No, look at the curb. That’s a loading zone and the area in front of it is a red zone. 

Alan: This is impossible. We’ve driven along this s treet four times and there are no parking spaces, not even ones with meters. I’d b e willing to plug the meter all evening if we could just find a space. 

Sasha: I have an idea. Pull into that red zone. 

Alan: Okay, but we can’t park here. What’s that? 

Sasha: This is my grandfather’s handicapped placard . I borrowed it. We can park here with this. 

Alan: I don’t think so. We’re going to get a parkin g ticket or worse, and we really shouldn’t be using your grandfather’s placard anywa y.  

 Sasha: Do you know how many strings I had to pull t o get a reservation at the hottest restaurant in town? Come on, let’s go. Why are you checking your wallet? Dinner is my treat. 

Alan: I just want to make sure I have enough cash f or a taxi when your car gets towed!

Our dialogue begins with Alan saying to Sasha, “We have to find a parking space. ” A “parking space” is a small area, a place  in which you can park your car. If you drive down the street, usually there ar e spaces along the street where you can park a car. Alan is looking for a parking s pace. He suggests to Sasha that they “drive around the block one more time.” 

A “block” (block) here refers to a square or rectan gle of land that is surrounded by four streets. So, in a typical city, some of the  streets go north to south, others go east to west, and you can find “blocks” that are  in between the streets. The blocks are where the houses and buildings are. You drive your car on the street, of course. They’re going to drive around the block in order to find a parking space.  

Alan says, “Did you say that the restaurant we’re g oing to has no off-street parking at all?” “Off-street parking” is parking th at is in a garage or in what we would call a “parking lot” – an area of land specia lly designated to park cars on. There is “street parking” where you park your car o n the side of the road or street, and then there is “off-street parking” wher e you park it in a parking lot or a parking garage. Sasha says, “None,” meaning the res taurant doesn’t have any off-street parking.  

“When I called the restaurant earlier today,” she s ays, “I was told they have ample street parking.” “Ample” (ample) means more t han enough, or plenty. Streets are “public,” which means anyone can park t heir car there. So, even if a restaurant says they have a lot of street parking a round them, they can’t reserve that parking – they can’t say, “Well, no one else c an park there but our customers.” And so this is the problem that Sasha a nd Alan are having. They are trying to find a place on the street to park near t he restaurant and there doesn’t appear to be any.  

Alan says, “Obviously not on a Saturday night,” mea ning the restaurant obviously does not have an ample parking, especially on a bus y night like Saturday. Then  

he says, “Look, there’s a space!” He thinks he sees  a place for him to park. Sasha says, “No, look at the curb.” The “curb” (cur b) is a raised concrete border, really, that is on the side of the street. It separ ates the street from the rest of the land, the sidewalk, or the area next to the street that is part of the block. Sasha says, “Look at the curb. That’s a loading zone and the area in front of it is a red zone.” 

Sometimes there will be paint on the curb to tell y ou if you can park there or not. A “loading (loading) zone (zone)” is an area where you can park only for a few minutes in order to take something out of your car or to put something into your car. A “loading zone,” then, would be an area usual ly indicated by yellow paint on the curb, where you can only park for a short amoun t of time. A “red zone” is an area with the curb painted red, where you cannot pa rk at all. Those are areas where if you do park, the police will come and give  you a ticket – give you a fine – or perhaps even remove your car.  

Sasha says that there is not a place for them to pa rk on the street, that the place that Alan sees is actually a loading zone and a red  zone. Alan says, “This is impossible. We’ve driven along this street four tim es and there are no parking spaces, not even ones with meters.” A “meter” (mete r) here refers to a parking meter, where you can park in a certain place but yo u have to pay a certain amount of money for every fifteen or thirty minutes  that you park there. Alan says, “I’d be willing to plug the meter all evening  if we could just find a space.” 

“To plug (plug) the meter,” or “to plug the parking  meter,” means to put coins into the parking meters. Nowadays, many parking meters t ake credit cards, but we probably would still use the same expression, “to p lug the meter” – to put coins into the parking meter. Sasha says, “I have an idea . Pull into the red zone.” “To pull into” means to park your car. She’s telling Al an to park the car in the red zone – which, remember, is a place where you’re not  supposed to park. Alan says, “Okay, but we can’t park here. What’s that?” 

Sasha says, “This is my grandfather’s handicapped p lacard. I borrowed it. We can park here with this.” “Handicapped” (handicappe d) refers to someone who has some sort of physical problem –maybe they have problems walking or they have some other issue that makes them unable to wal k or to move as easily as most people. A “placard” (placard) is a little sign  that you either put in the front part of your car near your window or you hang it fr om what we call your “rear view mirror,” which is the mirror in your car that allows you to see what’s going on behind you.  

If you are handicapped, the government will give yo u a special placard, a special card that you can put into your car that will allow  you to park in special places. Usually we call these “handicapped spaces” or “hand icapped parking.” They will also allow you in some cities to park at a parking meter and not pay. However, they never allow you to park in a red zone, but Sas ha somehow thinks that if she uses this handicapped placard of her grandfather, s he can park there. Another thing about a handicapped placard – you are not all owed to use it if you are not handicapped.  

But of course, Sasha is using it anyway. Alan says,  “I don’t think so. We’re going to get a parking ticket or worse, and we really sho uldn’t be using your grandfather’s placard anyway.” Alan knows that this  is not the right thing to do. He knows also, or at least he should know, that par king in a red zone even with a handicapped placard will get you a parking ticket –  a penalty for parking there. Usually the police will leave a little piece of pap er on your car telling you that you are now going to have to pay a “fine,” an amount of  money as a punishment for parking there.  

Sasha says, “Do you know how many strings I had to pull to get a reservation at the hottest restaurant in town?” The expression “to  pull some strings” means to use your power or your influence in order to get so mething done that other people wouldn’t be able to get done. If you want to  get tickets to a concert, and you know somebody who works where the concert is be ing held, you might ask that person for a favor to get you some tickets tha t other people would not be able to get. That would be “pulling some strings.” 

Sasha pulled some strings to get a reservation at t he hottest restaurant in town. The word “hottest” here means most popular – the on e that everyone wants to go to right now. Sasha says, “Come on, let’s go. Why a re you checking your wallet?” meaning why are you looking at your wallet, or insi de of your wallet.  

Sasha says, “Dinner is my treat.” To say something is your “treat” (treat) means you are going to pay for it. If I say, “I’m going t o invite you to dinner. It’s my treat,” that means I’m going to pay for your dinner. I’m no t, actually, but if you want to invite me to dinner and make it your treat, I’d be happy to go with you. Sasha is wondering why Alan is looking at his wallet since s he is going to pay for dinner. That’s what she means when she says, “Dinner is my treat.” 

Alan says, however, “I just want to make sure I hav e enough cash,” enough money, “for a taxi when your car gets towed!” “To t ow” (tow) means to use a truck to take a car and remove it from where it is.  If you park your car in a place where it should not be, sometimes the local police will tow your car. They will get  

a truck and they will remove your car, and then you  have to pay a lot of money to get your car back. I know. It’s happened to me. And  if you park in a red zone, even with a handicapped placard, you will also get towed.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
