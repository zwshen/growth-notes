Let's get started.  > Juan:  You’ll never guess who I got an email from yesterday.  Naomi:  Who?  Juan:  Diana Shultz.  Naomi:  Weren’t you two an item back in high school?  So, you got an email from an old flame.  Very interesting.    Juan:  Well, that’s ancient history.  We lost touch after we went off to college.  Naomi:  What did she say in her email?  Juan:  She said she was going to be in town next month and wanted to know if I wanted to get together for dinner.  Naomi:  Are you going to go?  Juan:  I don’t know.  Her email came out of the blue.    Naomi:  Aren’t you dying of curiosity?  I know I would be.  Maybe she still has feelings for you.
