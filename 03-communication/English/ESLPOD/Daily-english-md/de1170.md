This episode is a dialogue about the names that you  give your children, and perhaps a few that you don’t want to give your chil dren. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Celeste: So, here is my shortlist.

Albert: A shortlist for what?

Celeste: Baby names.

Albert: We have months to decide. Don’t you think w e should wait?

Celeste: No, I want to be prepared. Here, take a lo ok. See what you think.

Albert: Ezekiel?! You want to name our child Ezekie l? He’ll be teased by every kid in school.

Celeste: It’s a family name. I was trying to appeas e my parents. They’ve been suggesting a lot of family names. We could call him  by a nickname, maybe “Zeke.”

Albert: I’m not naming my child Ezekiel. His name w ould be Ezekiel Eckleman. That’s a mouthful. I also want to steer clear of al literative names. I’ve never liked them.

Celeste: Okay, are there any names you like on my l ist?

Albert: Not Alan Phillip. That’s for sure.

 Celeste: Why not? I thought we’d name the baby afte r my grandfather. Alan is a nice first name and Phillip is a nice middle name.

Albert: His initials would be “A.P.E.” – ape! He wo uld never live that down.

Celeste: How about “Mikol”?

Albert: You mean an alternate spelling for “Michael ”? People don’t know how to pronounce a name with an odd spelling.

Celeste: Well, are there any names you do like?

Albert: Albert Eckleman Junior has a nice ring to it.

Celeste: As you say, we have months to decide. Let’ s keep an open mind.

Albert: Humph!

[end of dialogue]

Celeste begins our dialogue by saying to Albert, “S o, here is my shortlist.” A “shortlist” (shortlist) is a list of possibilities,  usually a list of names for something that has been selected from a longer list. So, let’ s say that you are going to hire someone for your company – you’re going to find a n ew employee – and you interview 10 people. You then decide that three of these people might be good employees. Those three people then are on your “sho rtlist.” The shortlist is the final list of possibilities from which you make a s election, from which you pick what you want.

In this case, it’s a shortlist of names that Celest e and Albert are going to give their child. Albert asks, however, “A shortlist for  what?” He doesn’t know what Celeste is talking about, which is very common amon g husbands, I should add. Celeste says, “Baby names.” Albert says, “We have the months to decide,” meaning we don’t have to decide this right now. “Do n’t you think we should wait?” he asks. Celeste says, “No, I want to be pre pared.” I want to be ready. “Here, take a look,” she says, meaning look at it. “See what you think,” she adds.

Albert immediately doesn’t like one of the names on  this shortlist. He says, “Ezekiel?! You want to name our child Ezekiel?” “To  name a child” is to give the child a name. The verb “to name” means to give some one a certain name. “Name” can be a noun and a verb. Albert doesn’t see m to like the name Ezekiel.

He says, “He’ll be teased by every kid in school.” The “he” here is the baby. “To be teased” (teased) means to be made fun of.

The verb “to tease” means to make fun of someone – to do something or say something that will make other people laugh at a pe rson, or perhaps will make the other person not feel very good about himself. That’s often the result of teasing. “To tease,” however is usually a verb that  means not to be mean to someone, but simply to have fun with someone by mak ing a joke about that person. Children often tease other children – make fun of other children – if a child is different in some way, perhaps. Albert is worried that his child will be teased by the other children because of his name.

It’s not uncommon for children to tease other child ren by making fun of their names. That happened in my family all the time. My name is “Jeffrey Lawrence,” and if you put the initials – the first letters of those two words together – you get “J. L.” Well, “J. L.,” if you say it fast, sounds l ike the word “jail” (jail). So, my brothers and sisters would tease me by saying, “Jai l. You’re going to go to jail.” You know, stupid things like that. Don’t worry, I’m  – I’m over it. It no longer bothers me. The psychological counseling has taken care of it.

Anyway, back to our dialogue. Celeste says, “It’s a  family name,” meaning Ezekiel is a name that other people in Celeste’s fa mily have had. People often name their children using names from their family –  that their grandfather had or that some other relative or member of the family ha s had. Celeste says, “I was trying to appease my parents.” “To appease” (appeas e) normally means to try to make someone happy who is otherwise upset or angry – to do something that will stop the person from being angry.

Celeste perhaps thinks that her parents will be ang ry if she doesn’t name her child after one of the members of Celeste’s family.  “To name after” means to give someone the same name as someone else. For example,  my brother Frank, or Francis, was named after my grandfather, who also h ad the name Francis. “To be named after” means to give someone the same name  as someone else. It could be someone in your family. It could be someon e famous, someone that perhaps your parents like – an actor or a poet or the postman, the guy who delivers your mail. Who knows?

Celeste says she was trying to appease her parents by giving the baby the family name of Ezekiel. She says, “They’ve been suggesting  a lot of family names.” “They” here means her parents. “We could call him b y a nickname, maybe ‘Zeke.’” A “nickname” (nickname) is an informal nam e that you use instead of your full name. Sometimes it’s a shorter version of  your full name. Someone

whose name is Christopher might be called “Chris” f or short, or Jeffrey might be called “Jeff.”

Nicknames can also be unrelated to your name. When I was in grade school, I was one of the shortest kids in my class, and so I was called “Shorty” (Shorty). I was also one of the dumbest kids in my class, so th ey could have called me something a lot worse, believe me. Celeste is sugge sting that even though “Ezekiel” might not be a name that Albert likes, th ey could call the baby “Zeke” as a nickname, which sounds a lot better to them.

Albert, however, says, “I’m not naming my child Eze kiel. His name would be Ezekiel Eckleman.” Obviously, Albert and Celeste’s last name is Eckleman. “That’s a mouthful,” Albert says. When someone says  something is a “mouthful” (mouthful), he means it’s a lot of things to say or  it’s difficult to say. If a word is very long or difficult to say, something like “anti disestablishmentarianism” – no, I won’t explain what that is – that’s a “mouthful.” I t’s difficult to say.

Albert says, “I also want to steer clear of alliter ative names.” “To steer (steer) clear (clear) of” something means to avoid doing so mething or not to go near something. If you and your friend don’t agree about  politics, you may “steer clear of politics” when you talk to each other. You avoid  that topic. Albert wants to steer clear of “alliterative” (alliterative) names.  “Alliterative” refers to words that begin with the same letter or sound.

So, “Jeff Johnson” is alliterative because both wor ds begin with J – the “J” sound. “Ezekiel Eckleman” is alliterative because both wor ds begin with the same sound. Celeste says, “Okay, are there any names you  like on my list?” Albert says, “Not Alan Phillip. That’s for sure.” He selec ts another name, actually a first name and a middle name, that he doesn’t like.

Celeste says, “Why not? I thought we’d name the bab y after my grandfather.” Again, “to name after” means to give him the same n ame as another person. “Alan is a nice first name and Philip is a nice mid dle name.” My first name, as I mentioned, is Jeffrey, legally. That’s the name tha t I have on my official documents. My middle name is Lawrence. Not everyone  in the United States has a middle name, a second name. Many people just have  a first name and a last name. But I still think most people have middle nam es.

Celeste wants to give their baby the middle name of  Phillip. But Albert says that if they give their child the name Alan Phillip, “his i nitials would be A.P.E. – ‘ape.’” “Initials” are the first letters of words. I mentio ned how my initials of my first two names are J. L. Well, the child, if he’s given the name of Alan Phillip would have

the initials A.P.E., which spells out the word “ape .” “Ape” is an animal similar to a monkey, and perhaps not something that you would wa nt to be called.

In fact, Albert says that the baby, the child, “wou ld never live that down.” “To never live something down” means that people will n ever forget about something that was bad or embarrassing about you. Celeste the n suggests a different name, which is “Mikol” (Mikol). This is not the nor mal way of spelling “Michael,” and Albert, I think for good reason, doesn’t like that idea either. He says, “You mean an alternate spelling for ‘Michael?’” “Alterna te (alternate) spelling” would be a different way of spelling a name.

My name, “Jeffrey,” can also be spelled (Geoffrey),  in addition to (Jeffrey), which is the way I spell it. Albert says, “People don’t k now how to pronounce a name with an odd (odd) spelling.” “Odd” means unusual or  unexpected. And it’s usually used to describe something that’s unusual in a bad way. Nowadays you see many odd spellings of names in English, I suppose. Parents want to be different. They want their child to be unique, to be unlike an yone else, or maybe the parents were just drinking very heavily when they d ecided on the name. That’s my personal theory.

Anyway, let’s finish our dialogue. Celeste says, “W ell, are there any names you do like?” Albert says, “Albert Eckleman Junior has a nice ring to it.” If a boy has the same name as his father – the same first, middl e, and last names as his father – usually we add the word “junior” at the en d of the name so that you can tell the difference or you know the difference betw een the father and the son.

My father’s name was Patrick Dean McQuillan. He nam ed one of my brothers Patrick Dean McQuillan, and so my brother’s name is  Patrick Dean McQuillan Junior. When this happens, the father will often ad d the word “senior” to his name. So my father became Patrick Dean McQuillan Se nior. Now, you may be thinking what happens if my brother names his male child, his boy, Patrick Dean McQuillan? Well, he becomes Patrick Dean McQuillan III. And in fact, I have a nephew named Patrick Dean McQuillan III.

What happens if the Patrick Dean McQuillan III name s his child Patrick Dean McQuillan? Well, he would become Patrick Dean McQui llan IV, and so on. Now, my nephew did not name his child Patrick Dean McQui llan IV. Strangely, he did name him Patrick McQuillan, but the middle name is different. His middle name is Truman, which is a very unusual name. It’s actually  the last name, you may know, of one of our American presidents, Harry Trum an. He was named after Harry Truman – that is to say, his middle name.

 There is a tradition in the United States of giving  someone a middle name that is normally a last name when you are naming them after  someone. One of the most famous Americans of the late nineteenth, early twen tieth centuries was George Washington Carver. George Washington, of course, wa s the first president of the United States. George Washington Carver’s middle na me was Washington, just as my great nephew’s middle name is Truman.

Okay, I know, the dialogue – let’s finish. “Albert Eckleman Junior,” Albert says, “has a nice ring (ring) to it.” When you say someth ing “has a nice ring to it,” you mean it sounds nice. It sounds pleasant. It sounds good to you. Celeste, however, isn’t very happy with Albert’s solution he re of naming the baby boy after himself. Celeste says, “As you say, we have months to decide. Let’s keep an open mind.” “To keep an open mind” means to not mak e a decision yet. Albert isn’t very happy with that. He says “Humph!” He’s n ot happy.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue – finally – at a n ormal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Celeste: So, here is my shortlist.

Albert: A shortlist for what?
