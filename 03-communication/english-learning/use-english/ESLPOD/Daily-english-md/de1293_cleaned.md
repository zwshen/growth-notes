Go to ESLPod.com for more information. This episode  is a dialogue between Ann and Milo about noises that the human body makes , even when you don’t want it to. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Ann: I’ve had it. Jim has got to go! 

Milo: Go? He’s my best friend. I told him he could stay here until he got back on his feet. He’s not in your way, is he? 

Ann: He doesn’t have to get in my way for me to kno w he’s in the house all the time. He snores so loudly I can hear him from our b edroom. He’s constantly hiccupping and wheezing, too. 

Milo: Well, the guy can’t help it if he snores, hic cups, or wheezes.  

Ann: But he can help snorting when he laughs and wh istling all the time. And he constantly cracks his knuckles and it’s driving me up the wall. 

Milo: Those are bad habits. You know it’s hard to b reak bad habits. 

Ann: And what about his burping all through dinner and farting in the living room? That’s disgusting! 

Milo: Okay, I’ll talk to him. I’m sure he’s not awa re he’s doing most of these things. He’s always lived alone. 

Ann: Really? I wonder why. 

[end of dialogue] 

Ann begins our dialogue by saying to Milo, “I’ve ha d it.” When someone says they “have had it,” he means he is no longer able t o tolerate or allow something. When a situation becomes so difficult or so impossi ble for someone that the person no longer wants to deal with it – no longer wants to, we would say, “put up with it” – that person might say that he’s “had it.” Another phrasal verb we use in this situation is “to be fed (fed) up.” If someo ne says, “I’m fed up,” he means he’s angry. He’s mad and he doesn’t want to put up with, or tolerate, a situation any longer.  

Ann has a problem with Jim. She says, “Jim has got to go,” meaning Jim must leave. Milo says, “Go? He’s my best friend.” So, Ji m is Milo’s best friend. Milo continues, “I told him,” meaning I told Jim, “he co uld stay here until he got back on his feet.” So, Milo has told his friend Jim that  Jim could live at his house “until he got back on his feet.”  

Usually we use that expression “to get back on your  feet” when you have been in a difficult situation and you need time before you can go back and do the things you normally do. It may be that you were ill, that you were sick, or perhaps you lost your job and don’t have any money. Both of the se would be cases where you might need to get back on your feet, by either gett ing well or getting a job.  

Milo says that Jim is “not in your way, is he?” He’ s asking Ann if Jim is in her way. “To be in someone’s way” (way) means to be pre venting another person from doing what that person wants, either because y ou are physically in the same space that person wants to be, or perhaps you are getting in the way or bothering the person because you are preventing tha t person from doing what he wants.  

Ann says that Jim “doesn’t have to get in my way fo r me to know he’s in the house all the time. He snores so loudly,” Ann says,  “I can hear him from our bedroom.” So, Ann and Milo are a couple living toge ther, and we have Jim, the friend, living in the house also. But Jim “snores” (snores). “To snore” means to make a loud noise when you are sleeping, usually wi th your nose and mouth. That would be snoring. I sometimes snore. That’s wh at my wife tells me, anyway. I’m not sure it’s true, though. I don’t think it is . I’ve never heard myself snoring so I don’t think I actually do.  

But Jim definitely does because Ann can hear him fr om her bedroom – that is, where she and Milo sleep. Ann says that Jim is “con stantly hiccupping and wheezing, too.” To do something “constantly” means all of the time or repeatedly, over and over again. It’s often used nowadays to me an simply a lot, so much so that it seems as though it is happening continually , or without interruption.   

 “To hiccup” (hiccup) is to make a noise, without wa nting to, that sounds a little like a cough but usually is a higher pitch and is s omething that goes on for a certain number of minutes, perhaps, or even longer.  It’s not something that people want to do, but it’s something their body do es “involuntarily,” we would say. You breathe in suddenly and it makes a noise. That’s “to hiccup.”  

“To wheeze” (wheeze) is to breathe in, making a ver y loud sound. Often this happens when you are sick, when you have some sort of illness in your lungs, the parts of your body that take in air and expel o r breathe out air. If you smoke a lot, sometimes you may also wheeze. Milo says, “Wel l, the guy can’t help it if he snores, hiccups, or wheezes.” When we say someone “ can’t help it,” we mean they have no power over that situation. They can’t change that situation.  

Ann says, “But he can help snorting when he laughs and whistling all the time.” “To snort” (snort) is to make a loud noise when you  are breathing in, but more with your nose than with your lungs. It’s sort of l ike snoring, but you do it when you are awake. Some people do it sometimes when the y laugh. Sounds a little like a pig, actually. In fact, that is the way we d escribe the noise of a pig, “to snort.”  

Jim snorts when he laughs and whistles all the time . “To whistle” (whistle) means to make a sound with your mouth, usually one that i s high-pitched. This is whistling. Well, that’s not very good whistling but  you get the idea. Ann says that Jim is always whistling, “and he constantly cracks his knuckles and it’s driving me up the wall,” she says.  

“To crack (crack) your knuckles (knuckles)” means t o make a loud sound or noise by pushing your fingers into the flat part of  your hand. Your “knuckles” are the parts of your hand where the fingers meet the r est of your hand, what we would call the “palm” (palm) of the hand. “To crack  your knuckles” means to make a noise with the bones in your hands. I can’t do it myself, at least not willingly, not voluntarily, though as I grow old, o ther bones in my body begin to crack.  

It’s driving Ann up the wall. “To drive someone up the wall” means to make someone crazy. It’s an expression that is used to m ean to bother or annoy someone. Milo says, “Those are bad habits.” A “habi t” (habit) is something you do all the time or something you do without thinkin g about it very much. A “bad habit” would be something that is not good for you that you do all the time.  

Milo says, “You know it’s hard,” or difficult, “to break bad habits.” “To break a bad habit” means to stop doing something that is bad fo r you. Smoking cigarettes is a bad habit and you should probably break your bad ha bit, at least if you want to live long. Though not everyone who smokes dies from  smoking, but a lot of people do – enough so that it’s probably a good ide a. Ann says, “And what about his burping all through dinner and farting in the l iving room? That’s disgusting.”  

“To burp” (burp) is to make a loud noise allowing a ir to escape from your stomach, often because you have eaten something and  you have what is called “gas” (gas). It’s not a very pleasant sound. Here’s  an example, not by me. The verb “to fart” (fart) is definitely an informal one . A more polite way might be saying “to pass gas.” It basically is making a loud  noise when the gas, instead of going through your mouth and out your mouth, I shou ld say, goes out, well, the other end of your body. I won’t give you an example  of that.  

In both cases, Ann is correct in saying that it’s o ften considered “disgusting” (disgusting). Something that is “disgusting” makes other people sick or uncomfortable. It’s something that is considered ve ry unpleasant or not nice. Milo says, “Okay, I’ll talk to him. I’m sure he’s not aw are he’s doing most of these things. He’s always lived alone.” Milo doesn’t thin k Jim is “aware” (aware). “To be aware” means to know something is happening, to kno w what is going on. The reason is that Jim has always “lived alone,” lived by himself.  

Ann says, “Really? I wonder why.” Ann is making a j oke. She knows why Jim has probably always lived alone because no one wants to  live with him. He has all of these strange body noises he always makes.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Ann: I’ve had it. Jim has got to go! 

Milo: Go? He’s my best friend. I told him he could stay here until he got back on his feet. He’s not in your way, is he? 

Ann: He doesn’t have to get in my way for me to kno w he’s in the house all the time. He snores so loudly I can hear him from our b edroom. He’s constantly hiccupping and wheezing, too. 

Milo: Well, the guy can’t help it if he snores, hic cups, or wheezes.  

Ann: But he can help snorting when he laughs and wh istling all the time. And he constantly cracks his knuckles and it’s driving me up the wall. 

Milo: Those are bad habits. You know it’s hard to b reak bad habits. 

Ann: And what about his burping all through dinner and farting in the living room? That’s disgusting!
