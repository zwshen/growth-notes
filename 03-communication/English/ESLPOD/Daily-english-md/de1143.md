On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Alonso and Virginia about fixing or repairing an appliance – a machine in your house that does some work for you, such as a dishwasher or a clothes dry er. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Virginia: Hand me that screwdriver, will you?

Alonso: Don’t tell me you’re trying to fix that dry er yourself. We need to call in an authorized repairman or repairwoman.

Virginia: Do you have any idea what they’ll charge?

Alonso: All right, then I’ll call a handyman and se e if he knows anything about fixing dryers.

Virginia: If he doesn’t, he might make matters wors e. I think it’s just a matter of clearing a clog or replacing a worn component.

Alonso: Yes, but which one? We should just upgrade to a newer model.

Virginia: This dryer does not need to be replaced. It’s not that old.

Alonso: But it’s been on the fritz on and off for a  year.

Virginia: I don’t want to throw out a perfectly goo d appliance just because of a minor problem.

Alonso: Well, this “minor problem” is the reason I had to walk to work in damp clothes this morning.

Virginia: That wasn’t so bad, was it?

Alonso: In the middle of winter?! You try walking w ith icicles in the most uncomfortable places!

This episode is called “Repairing an Appliance.” An  “appliance” (appliance) is any machine, powered usually by electricity, that perfo rms tasks in the home, such as a dishwasher, a washing machine, a toaster, a coffe e maker – all of these could be called “appliances.” Our dialogue begins with Vi rginia asking Alonso, “Hand me that screwdriver, will you?” “To hand” someone s omething means to give it to the person, to put it in the person’s hand.

Virginia asks for a “screwdriver,” which is a speci al tool used for putting in and taking out small metal pieces called “screws” (scre ws). A “screw” is used usually to connect two pieces of material, such as two piec es of wood in a chair. Alonso says, “Don’t tell me you’re trying to fix that drye r yourself.” “To fix” (fix) means the same as to repair. When something is broken, when s omething isn’t working properly, you may try to repair it, to fix it. Virg inia is trying to fix a “dryer” (dryer) which is an appliance you use to dry wet clothing.

Alonso says, “We need to call in an authorized repa irman or repairwoman.” “To call in” is a phrasal verb meaning to get someone t o come to your house or your business, usually to fix something or to help you w ith something. An “authorized (authorized) person” is someone who has official pe rmission to do something. For example, if you own an Apple computer, you can take it to a person or a store to get it fixed. The person might be “authori zed by Apple,” meaning Apple has said, “Yes, this person knows how to fix our co mputers.”

Some companies have authorized repair places – or r epair “shops,” we might call them – that you can use to bring your broken applia nce or broken machine and get it fixed. Alonso thinks they should call an aut horized repairman. A “repairman” is a person who fixes something. Now, m ore recently we have started to use “repairman” to refer only to a male human being who fixes things. That’s why Alonso says a “repairman or a repairwoma n.” I suppose we might also say a “repairperson,” meaning you’re not sure if it’s a man or a woman.

Virginia says, “Do you have any idea what they’ll c harge?” “To charge” (charge) here means to request an amount of money in order to do something. If you go to get your car fixed, the mechanic – the person who f ixes your car – will charge you something for doing it. He will say, “You have to pay me a thousand dollars.” That’s what he is charging you.

Virginia asks Alonso, “Do you have any idea what th ey’ll,” meaning the repair people, “charge?” This particular question, “Do you  have any idea,” is usually used when you are angry or perhaps surprised that a nother person thinks something that you think is clearly wrong, or doesn ’t have the information that the person should have. If your wife says, “I think we should drive from New York City to Los Angeles for our vacation,” you might sa y, “Do you have any idea how long it will take to drive from New York to Los Ang eles?” You’re surprised that your wife is suggesting this.

Anyway, Alonso says, “All right, then I’ll call a h andyman and see if he knows anything about fixing dryers.” A “handyman” (handym an) is a person whose job it is to fix things, usually someone who isn’t an expe rt or doesn’t have formal training in doing the kinds of things that he does.  But sometimes a handyman will, in fact, have some education. Usually handyme n don’t have licenses or official permissions to do things, but they know ho w to do them.

Many people, instead of going out and, say, getting  an electrician to fix a problem in their home with the electricity, will hire a han dyman – someone who doesn’t have the same education and training but may know h ow to fix smaller problems that you have in your house. Virginia says, “If he doesn’t,” meaning if he doesn’t know anything about fixing dryers, “he might make m atters worse.” The phrase “to make matters (matters) worse” means to make a b ad situation even worse, to make a problem bigger than it is right now.

Virginia says, “I think it’s just a matter of,” mea ning it only requires, “clearing a clog or replacing a worn component.” A “clog” (clog ) is when you have something blocking the flow of water through a pipe. If your kitchen sink is “clogged,” the water won’t go down into the pipes. The pipe is clo gged. There’s something blocking it, and sometimes you need to do something  to get that clog removed. You may need to pour some sort of chemical into the  pipe. I don’t know, I’m not a plumber. I’m not a person who fixes things like clo gged pipes.

Virginia thinks the problem with this dryer is a cl og, which is kind of unusual since dryers don’t normally have clogs. They don’t usuall y use water, although I suppose you could have a clog in a pipe connected t o a dryer that goes to the

outside. You know, sometimes clothes dryers have a pipe that goes to the roof or goes to the outside wall. There might be a clog in that, I suppose.

Virginia also thinks the problem might be a “worn ( worn) component (component).” A worn component would be a piece of something that has been used so much that it’s no longer doing what it’s su pposed to be doing. You can think of your tires on your car being worn. They ha ve been used so much that they no longer are able to do what they are suppose d to do. You have to get them replaced. Alonso says, “Yes, but which one?” m eaning which part, which component is worn.

He then says, “We should just upgrade to a newer mo del.” “To upgrade” (upgrade) means to buy a newer version of something . So if you own, say, an iPhone 4, you might want to upgrade to an iPhone 5 or an iPhone 6. You might want to buy the newer “model” (model). The model is  the version of a product. The iPhone 4, 5, and 6 are three different models of the iPhone.

Virginia says, “This dryer does not need to be repl aced.” “To replace” something means to bring something in to do what the machine is doing now – basically, to get a different machine. She says, “It’s not that o ld,” meaning it’s not very old. Alonso says, “But it’s been on the fritz on and off  for a year.” “To be on the fritz” (fritz) means not to be working reliably, not to be  working correctly. It’s an informal expression, “to be on the fritz.” You don’ t hear it as much anymore, but you can still use it.

If something is happening “on and off,” it isn’t ha ppening all the time. If you describe your relationship with a girlfriend as bei ng “on and off,” that means that sometimes she is your girlfriend and sometimes you break up and are not going out together, and then perhaps later she becomes yo ur girlfriend again. It’s “on and off.” Why? I don’t know. She’s not my girlfrien d.

Virginia says, “I don’t want to throw out” – that i s, I don’t want to get rid of – “a perfectly good appliance just because of a minor,” or not very important, “problem.” “Perfectly good” means there’s nothing w rong with it. It’s good enough. It works. Alonso says, “Well, this minor pr oblem is the reason I had to walk to work in damp clothes this morning.” “Damp” (damp) means slightly wet or a little moist. Alonso is saying that he had to wal k to work in “damp clothes” because the clothes dryer wasn’t working.

Virginia asks, however, “That wasn’t so bad, was it ?” meaning that isn’t really that bad. What are you complaining about? Alonso sa ys, however, “In the middle of winter?! You try walking with icicles in the mos t uncomfortable places!” We

learn that Alonso had to walk to work in damp cloth es in the middle of winter, and of course if it’s in the middle of winter and you h ave water, sometimes icicles form. An “icicle” (icicle) is a long pointed piece of ice, usually formed when water is dripping from a high surface such as a roof or t he branch of a tree.

Now of course, in the case of Alonso, he probably d idn’t actually have icicles on his clothing. He’s just telling Virginia that he do esn’t want to walk to work in damp clothing in the wintertime when it’s cold out, and I can understand that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Virginia: Hand me that screwdriver, will you?

Alonso: Don’t tell me you’re trying to fix that dry er yourself. We need to call in an authorized repairman or repairwoman.

Virginia: Do you have any idea what they’ll charge?

Alonso: All right, then I’ll call a handyman and se e if he knows anything about fixing dryers.
