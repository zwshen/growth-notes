This episode is called “Scheduling an Appointment.”  It’ s going to be a conversation between Ann and Serge about setting up a meeting – arranging a meeting between two people.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Ann:  Hello. 

Serge:  Hi, Ann.  It’s Serge.  I’m calling to make an  appointment for LeeAnn.  She wants to meet with Miles next week sometime. 

Ann:  Let me take a look at his appointment schedule.  Let’s see, can LeeAnn be here on Tuesday at 2:00? 

Serge:  No, she’s tied up all Tuesday afternoon, but I could shuffle around some of her commitments to free her up on Tuesday morning, i f that helps. 

Ann:  Unfortunately, Tuesday morning is out.  I could b ump someone on Wednesday afternoon at 3:00.  Can LeeAnn be here at t hat time? 

Serge:  She has an appointment at 2:30 in this office , but it shouldn’t last more than a half hour.  She should be able to make it by 3: 00 if she’s not running late. Better yet, I may be able to finagle something, maybe push back that appointment until she gets back to the office.  Why don ’t you pencil her in for now? 

Ann:  Okay, I’ll do that, but can you confirm with me by Monday? 

 Serge:  Sure, I’ll give you a heads up no later than noon on Monday if I can’t push back her other appointment. 

Ann:  Okay, sounds good.  Tell me, do you ever feel like we’re spinning our wheels, spending our days making, changing, and canceling a ppointments? 

Serge:  Yeah, every single day!

Ann begins by saying, “Hello,” answering the phone.  Ser ge says, “Hi, Ann.  It’s Serge.  I’m calling to make an appointment for LeeAn n.”  “To make an appointment” is to schedule a time to do something, usua lly to meet with someone.  Serge says that LeeAnn wants to meet with Mil es next week sometime.  Ann says, “Let me take a look at his appointmen t schedule.”  Your “appointment schedule” is a calendar showing when you have  meetings.  Ann says, “Let’s see, can LeeAnn be here on Tuesday at 2:00?” meaning 2:00 in the afternoon.   

Serge says, “No, she’s tied up all Tuesday afternoon.”  Wh en we say we are “tied up” we mean we are busy, we are not available.  “I mea nt to answer his email this afternoon, but then I got all tied up with othe r things.”  I was busy; I was occupied.  Serge says that he could shuffle around some of  LeeAnn’s commitments to free her up on Tuesday morning.  “To shuf fle around” is a phrasal verb meaning to move or change things, to reorga nize things in a different position, either physically (in space) or tempo rally (in time).  People often use this when talking about their schedule: “I’m g oing to shuffle around my schedule so that I can see you tomorrow morning.”  Serge says he can shuffle around some of LeeAnn’s commitments (some of her oblig ations; some of her other meetings, most likely) to free her up.  “To free (someone or something) up” means to make someone or something available; to change things so that they are no longer tied up; they’re no longer busy.  “Let m e see if I can free up some time to see you this afternoon,” let me see if I can move  some of my meetings so that we can talk this afternoon. 

Serge is offering to free up LeeAnn on Tuesday morning .  Ann says, “Unfortunately, Tuesday morning is out.”  When we say som ething is “out,” we mean it’s not possible; it’s not an option; I cannot do it at that time or day.  So Tuesday morning is not possible, then Ann says, “I could bum p someone on Wednesday afternoon at 3:00.”  “To bump (bump) (someo ne)” means to change when something will happen so that something else can ha ppen.  For example: “My friend was supposed to sing at the performance, but sh e was bumped by  

 another singer.”  They decided that they wanted someone else to sing.  We often use this expression when, for example, you are flying and t he airline sold too many tickets, which happens frequently.  They sold more ticke ts than they had seats for, and so they had to force some people to take a different plane.  You would say they were bumped.  That’s the meaning here, A nn is going to try to move someone on Wednesday afternoon. 

Serge says that unfortunately LeeAnn has an appointment at 2:30 in this office, but it shouldn’t last more than a half hour.  “To last ,” as a verb, means to go on for a certain amount of time, not to end until a cert ain amount of time has passed. So for example someone might ask, “How long is this rain going to last?” meaning how long will it be raining.  You might say, “Well, until probably 5:00 this afternoon,” it will last until 5:00.  Both “bump” an d “last” have additional meanings in English; taking look at our Learning Guide for tho se explanations. 

Serge says that LeeAnn should be able to make it (meani ng arrive to the meeting) by 3:00 if she’s not running late.  “To run l ate” means to be behind your schedule, to be doing things later than you had planne d because things took longer than expected.  If you tell someone you are goin g to meet them at a café at 8:00 and you see that you are not going to arrive o n time, you would want to call them, or text them, and tell them that you are ru nning late, that you will be there at whatever time you will be there, hopefully n ot too late. 

So, Serge says that she should be there by 3:00 if she’s n ot running late.  “Better yet,” he says, “I may be able to finagle something.”  “B etter yet” is an expression used to introduce another idea or another solution tha t you thought of that would work better than the one you were talking about previou sly.  So I give you plan A, and then I think: “Oh, no.  Plan B is better.”  So I’ ll say, “Better yet, let’s do plan B.”  It’s always supposed to be a better idea.  “Better yet,” Serge says, “I may be able to finagle (finagle) something.”  “To finagle”  means to be, perhaps, very smart about something, very clever.  It could also mean th at you’re being tricky; you’re doing something that you would not normally do i n order to get what you want.  We use this somewhat informal verb in situations t hat are difficult, but we think we can, somehow, arrange it so that it will be possible.  Serge is going to try to finagle something, try to figure something out: “ma ybe push back that appointment until she gets back to the office.”  To “p ush back” an appointment or a meeting is to move it to a later time or even to a later day.  You were going to meet someone Tuesday, but then they were going to busy, so  they asked to push back the meeting until Friday – to change it to a later date or time. 

Serge is suggesting that he push back LeeAnn’s appointment  – her 2:30 appointment, so that she can make a 3:00 meeting.  Serg e says, “Why don’t you  

 pencil her in for now?”  This expression, “to pencil (pen cil) (someone) in,” means to write someone’s name on a calendar, showing when the y plan on meeting that person, but still waiting for final confirmation.  The  reason we say “pencil” is because a pencil is something you write with that you can erase if you make a mistake.  A pen, of course, cannot be easily erased – most p ens.  So that’s why we use the word “pencil,” and we actually make it a ver b: “to pencil (someone) in.”  It means to put their name down for a certain t ime, but knowing that you have to wait until the person says, “I can definitely do i t.”  So, it’s when you’re not definite, when you’re not certain about something. 

Ann says, “Okay, I’ll do that (I’ll pencil her in), but ca n you confirm with me by Monday?”  “To confirm” is to verify that something is tr ue or correct.  So Serge is going to have to call Ann back sometime before Monday to  say definitely – certainly – yes or no, LeeAnn will be at the appointme nt.  Serge says, “Sure, I’ll give you a heads up no later than noon on Monday if I ca n’t push back her other appointment.”  “Heads up” means I’m giving you informa tion in advance. Sometimes “heads up” means a warning.  If you are out playing baseball and you throw a ball and it goes towards someone who doesn’t see  it coming, you would yell “Heads up!”  You’re warning them that they might get hit in the head with a baseball.  Well, it doesn’t always have to be related to  your head; it can be a warning about anything.  Or, it can be information a bout something that will happen in the future: “I’ll give you a heads up when I  am about to leave my office.”  That means I will call you or communicate with  you before I leave my office, or when I know what time I will be leaving my o ffice. 

So, Serge is going to give Ann a heads up no later tha n Monday at noon.  Ann says, “Okay, sounds good.  Tell me, do you ever feel like we’ re spinning our wheels.”  “To spin your wheels” means to be involved in a lot of activities that keep you very busy, but that don’t accomplish very much; you don ’t seem to get very much done, but you are constantly busy.  That would be  spinning your wheels.  Serge says, “Yeah, every single day!” meaning, sim ply, every day. “Single” is just used to emphasize – to stress something h appens every day, without missing a single day. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
