This episode is called “Guarding One’s Privacy.”  It’s a d ialogue between Dan and Mina talking about people who want to keep their  personal information private or secret.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

I went to visit my old friend, Mina, whom I hadn’t see n in several years.  It was one of the strangest afternoons of my life! 

Dan:  Hi, Mina, it’s really good to see you. 

Mina:  Dan, come in.  Hurry!   

Dan:  Uh, okay.  Why do you have four locks on your door, a nd why are all of the curtains drawn? 

Mina:  I like my privacy.  And anyway, I think there’s a pee ping Tom around this apartment building and I don’t want him to get a pe ek into my apartment. 

Dan:  Oh, okay.  I noticed that your name isn’t on your mailbox.  I wasn’t sure I had the right apartment number. 

Mina:  Do you think I would voluntarily give people that  information?  They are constantly trying to invade my privacy.  All I want is anony mity, but I have to be on guard all of the time.  These days, I only give out p ersonal information on a need-to-know basis. 

 Dan:  No offense, but isn’t that a little paranoid?  You act as though everybody is out to get you.   

Mina:  Aren’t they?  Haven’t you noticed?  We constantly have to disclose our most personal information on forms and to anyone who com es to our door.  If I didn’t know you were coming today, I wouldn’t have opene d my door at all. 

Dan:  You mean you live here in seclusion, like a hermit ? 

Mina:  Of course not!  I have plenty of friends.  Come a nd meet them all. 

Dan:  Wow, you must have 10 birds and 20 cats! 

Mina:  Yes, that’s right.  But, rest assured, none of t hem will breathe a word of what you say here today!

Our story begins with Dan saying that he went to visit hi s old friend, Mina, whom he hadn’t seen in several years.  “It was one of the str angest afternoons of my life!” he says. 

Dan says, “Hi, Mina, it’s really good to see you.”  Mina says, “Dan, come in. Hurry!”  Dan is obviously at Mina’s house, he knocks on her do or [sound of knocking], and she tells him to hurry up and come in.  D an says, “Uh, okay.  Why do you have four locks on your door, and why are all of the curtains drawn?”  A “lock” is something that you use to prevent other people f rom opening a door; Mina has four locks on her door.  She also has her curtai ns drawn.  “Curtains” are pieces of fabric that cover a window so you can’t see i nside.  “To be drawn” means, in this case, to be closed.  We use this word in t alking about curtains, sometimes we use the word “drapes.”  Curtains or drapes a re drawn when they are closed.  “Drawn,” however, has a couple of different  meanings in English, so be sure to look at the Learning Guide for this episode for some additional explanation of that. 

Mina says, “I like my privacy.”  “Privacy” is the ability to be alone, to keep your personal information secret so that other people don’t  know about you or what you are doing.  Privacy has become very important, especial ly on the Internet. Mina says, “I think there’s a peeping Tom around this apa rtment building and I don’t want him to get a peek into my apartment.”  The  expression “a peeping Tom” refers to a person – a man, typically – who is looki ng through the windows trying to watch women, especially when women are taking their clothes off.  It’s,  

 obviously, a very negative expression to use about someone; in  fact, you could probably get arrested by the police for being a peeping  Tom.  I’m not sure why the name Tom is used; I’m glad it isn’t a peeping Jeff!   Well, Mina says that she wants to make sure that this peeping doesn’t get a “pe ek” (peek) into her apartment.  “To peek at (something)” means to look quickl y at something, especially if it is difficult to see or if you’re not suppo sed to see it.  So, “taking a peek” means taking a quick look. 

Dan says, “Oh, okay.  I noticed that your name isn’t on your  mailbox,” the small box where the mail carrier (the person from the, usuall y, government agency that delivers mail to your house) puts your mail; the mailbox is the place where the mail is put.  Mina, however, does not have her name on her mailbox; Dan says, “I wasn’t sure I had the right apartment number.”  Mina says, “Do you think I would voluntarily give people that information?”  “Voluntari ly” means willingly, when you want to do something.  She’s saying “I would not volunt arily (of my own free will) give people my information,” such as her name.  She says, “ They are constantly trying to invade my privacy.”  They – we’re not sure who t hey are – are trying to invade her privacy.  “To invade (someone’s) privacy” is to lea rn something about another person that they want to be secret, that they d on’t want to tell you.  If someone sends you a personal letter and your friend open s the letter and reads it without telling you or without you giving them perm ission, that would be an “invasion of privacy,” he would be invading your privacy.  “I nvasion” is the noun from the verb “to invade.”  Normally, this verb “to inva de” refers to an army going into another country.  The ancient Roman army invaded Gr eece back in the second century B.C., I believe.   

Well, Mina doesn’t want anyone to invade her privacy, she  says, “All I want is anonymity, but I have to be on guard all the time.”  “ Anonymity” is to be anonymous; that is, to be in a situation where no one knows who you are or what you are doing.  “Anonymity” is a noun coming from the i dea of “anonymous,” which is unknown, so nobody knows about you.  She says, howeve r, that she has to be on guard all the time.  “To be on guard” i s an expression meaning to be very careful or cautious, to prevent something from happe ning; to be alert, this means to be on guard.  “Guard” has a couple of differe nt meanings in English however, so take a look at that Learning Guide for some more explanations.   

She says, “These days, I only give out personal informatio n on a need-to-know basis.”  The expression “need-to-know basis” is used to descri be a situation where people are only given information that they absol utely must have, and only that very necessary information is shared or given to them .  It’s an expression you would probably hear in the government or in the mi litary, talking about secrets that the military has or that a country has.  It’s not normally used in daily  

 conversation, but of course, Mina, here, is what we would  call a little bit “paranoid.”  She’s very worried that other people are going to hurt her or that other people are trying to follow her.  To be parano id is considered a negative description; it’s to be too worried, to be worried wit hout any good reason.   

In fact, Dan says, “No offense (meaning I don’t want to  hurt you by saying this, by insulting you), but isn’t that a little paranoid?”  Da n says, “You act as though everyone is out to get you.”  “To be out to get (someone )” means to be trying to do something to somebody, usually something bad.  If you  say your boss is out to get you, you’re saying your boss is trying to hurt you or harm you in some way. There are actually two expressions here: “To be out to do (something)” means to try to do something; “to get (someone)” means to attack,  hurt, or perhaps even kill someone.  So to say someone “is out to get you” means that someone is trying to harm you. 

Mina says, “Aren’t they?  Haven’t you noticed?  We constan tly have to disclose our most personal information on forms and to anyone w ho comes to our door.  If I didn’t know you were coming today, I wouldn’t have op ened my door at all.”  “To disclose” means to share or to give some secret or private i nformation to someone else.  So, Mina thinks that everyone is trying to i nvade her privacy by asking her for all this personal information. 

Dan then says to Mina, “You mean you live here in seclusio n, like a hermit?”  “To be in seclusion” means to be alone, without talking to o ther people or seeing other people.  A “hermit” is a person who lives alone and doesn’t speak to anyone else.  This was originally a religious idea among  the early Christians. They were men who would go out into the desert by the mselves, and live by themselves, and spend the whole day praying.  That was to  be a hermit, to be alone.  Women, also, sometimes were hermits, and there  are, even today, people who are hermits for religious purposes.  But Da n, here, is talking about Mina being by herself, and so he’s using the term “hermi t” almost as an insult. 

Mina says, “Of course not (of course I don’t live like a he rmit)!  I have plenty of friends.  Come and meet them all.”  Dan says, “Wow, you must have 10 birds and 20 cats!”  Her friends are animals.  Mina says, “Yes,  that’s right.  But, rest assured, none of them will breathe a word of what you say here today!”  The phrase “rest assured” means don’t worry; there is no probl em, there is no reason to worry.  She says none of these animals will breathe a word of what you say. “To breathe a word” is an expression that means to say some thing, especially to tell someone something that is personal, private, or secr et.  Of course, the animals won’t breathe a word; in fact, they can’t tal k, so it’s a pretty safe environment.  Obviously, Mina needs some help!  

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

I went to visit my old friend, Mina, whom I hadn’t see n in several years.  It was one of the strangest afternoons of my life! 

Dan:  Hi, Mina, it’s really good to see you.
