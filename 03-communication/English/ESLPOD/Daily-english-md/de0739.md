This episode is called “Performing an Intervention. ”  That’s when people come together and try to get someone who has a problem, especially a problem with addiction, to stop and get help.  Let’s get started . 

[start of dialogue] 

Petra:  Hey, what’s going on here?  Why are all of you here in my apartment?   

Johann:  Your family and close friends are here to perform an intervention.  We feel that you have a problem that is negatively aff ecting your life and the lives of the people around you.   

Petra:  An intervention?!  I don’t need an interven tion.  What am I supposed to be addicted to? 

Johann:  I think you know.  Each of us can attest t o your obsession and the consequences of that addiction.  It is interfering with your work and your personal relationships. 

Petra:  No, it’s not.  I can’t believe this.  I fee l cornered! 

Johann:  We just want to help you.  We all agree th at you need to see a therapist and maybe go into treatment. 

Petra:  You guys are all crazy.  Is that an ultimat um? 

Johann:  Yes, I’m afraid it is.  If you don’t stop your obsessive behavior, we’ll take that away. 

Petra:  What?!  Take away my MP3 player?  If you ta ke away my MP3 player, how am I supposed to listen to ESL Podcast? 

Johann:  That’s the idea.  Listening to ESL Podcast  14 hours a day is not healthy.   

Petra:  Okay, I know I’ve gone overboard, but I’ll stop.  I promise.   

Johann:  You’ll stop cold turkey? 

Petra:  Well…I need to be weaned off, I think.  How  about if I cut back to 10 hours a day to start? 

[end of dialogue] 

We begin our dialogue with Petra saying, “Hey, what ’s going on here (what is happening here)?  Why are all of you here in my apa rtment?”  Obviously, there’s a group of people there.  Johann says, “Your family  and close friends are here to perform an intervention.”  An “intervention” in thi s case means a meeting where close friends and relatives usually surprise an ind ividual, who isn’t expecting a meeting, because they are concerned about this pers on’s activities, usually involving an “addiction,” when you can’t stop doing  something.  We think about drug addictions, alcohol addictions, gambling addic tions, and so forth.  Johann says that they’re here “to perform” or to do an int ervention.  He says, “We feel (we believe) that you have a problem that is negati vely affecting your life and the lives of the people around you.”  “To affect” means  to have some influence or impact on something, to change something in some wa y.  They’re saying that Petra’s addiction is affecting other parts of her l ife, usually in a negative way.   

Petra says, “An intervention?!  I don’t need an int ervention.  What am I supposed to be addicted to?”  “To be addicted to” means to h ave an addiction regarding or involving something.  “I’m addicted to gambling” me ans that I can’t stop gambling.  I want to gamble all the time, or I’m ga mbling in such a way that it is hurting me but I can’t stop; I feel like I cannot s top it.  That’s an addiction.  That’s just an example, by the way; I am not myself a gamb ler. 

So, Petra is wondering what she is addicted to.  Jo hann says, “I think you know (you know what it is).  Each of us can attest to yo ur obsession and the consequences of that addiction.”  “To attest” (atte st) is to say it or prove that something is true based on your experiences – based  on some facts that you know of.  These friends and family of Petra can att est to her obsession.  An “obsession” is something that you think about all o f the time, something you  

cannot stop thinking about.  Some men have obsessio ns about women – specific women; we would say they are “obsessed with” them.  In this case, the friends and family of Petra believe she has an obsession, a nd they can also attest to the consequences of her addiction.  The “consequences” are the results, what happens because of, in this case, the addiction.  J ohann says, “It is interfering with your work and your personal relationships.”  “ To interfere with (something)” is to interrupt it, to make it less successful or l ess effective, to slow it down.  If an addiction is interfering with your work, it means t hat you are not working as well you should because you have this addiction. 

Petra says, “No, it’s not (it’s not interfering wit h my work or personal relationships).”  She says, “I can’t believe this.”   When someone is frustrated or is confused or surprised by something they may say thi s.  “I can’t believe this.  I feel cornered!”  “To be cornered” means to be trapped in  a place and you are unable to leave; you cannot escape.  “Corner” has a couple  of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some  of those. 

Johann says, “We just want to help you.  We all agr ee that you need to see a therapist and maybe go into treatment.”  Johann say s that they believe that Petra needs to see a therapist.  The word “therapist” (th erapist) can refer to a couple of different kinds of people: it could be a psychologi st, it could be a medical doctor – a psychiatrist, it could be someone trained in help ing people with addictions – a counselor.  If you put a word in front of “therapis t” sometimes you know more specifically.  These examples are all dealing with emotions, thoughts, and feelings – psychological issues, but you could also  have a physical therapist. That would be someone who helps you get over a cert ain problem.  Maybe you broke your leg and now you need to get your leg str engthened after the operation or whatever happened.  That would mean you would go  to a physical therapist, who would help you.   

Well, Petra needs a therapist to help her with her addiction.  Johann says that maybe she needs to go into treatment.  “Treatment” is a general term that refers to a program to help cure or help you when you are ill or sick.  In this case, treatment usually involves going to a separate hous e or building specifically for people who have this addiction, and you stay there.   Here in Hollywood, there are several places – very expensive – where celebrities  who are having addiction problems go.  Some of them go many times! 

Petra says, “You guys are all crazy.  Is that an ul timatum?”  An “ultimatum” is when you say something to someone that if they don’ t do something, something bad will happen to them.  It’s a kind of threat, or  could be.  It’s the last thing that you can do before something bad happens, in this ca se.    

 So, Petra’s asking if this is an ultimatum that she  go see the therapist.  Johann says, “Yes, I’m afraid it is.”  Remember, when we a re telling someone some bad news we often say “I’m afraid.”  It doesn’t mean yo u’re actually scared of anything; it’s just a polite way of saying somethin g negative or bad to someone: “I’m afraid that I cannot go with you today.”  You’ re giving someone bad news. Well, Johann says, “I’m afraid (that this is an old  an ultimatum).  If you don’t stop your obsessive behavior, we’ll take that away.”   

Johann is going to takes something away if Petra do esn’t stop her behavior. Petra says, “What?!  Take away my MP3 player?  If y ou take away my MP3 player, how am I supposed to listen to ESL Podcast? ”  Ah, now we understand her addiction!  Johann says, “That’s the idea.  Lis tening to ESL Podcast 14 hours a day is not healthy.”  “Healthy” is something that  is good for your physical or mental wellbeing – your being well, the opposite of  sick.  Petra says, “Okay, I know I’ve gone overboard, but I’ll stop.  I promise .”  “To go overboard” here means to do too much of something, to engage in som e sort of extreme behavior, or to do too much of any sort of action.  You meet a girl and the second day that you are with her you ask her to marry you;  you bring her dozens of flowers; you buy her a car.  That’s probably going overboard, even if you like the woman.  It’s actually a pretty good way of getting the woman to run away from you – not that I have any personal experience in th at.  I mean in going overboard; lots of women have run away from me, trust me! 

Anyway, Johann says that listening to ESL Podcast i s not healthy – 14 hours a day listening to ESL Podcast.  Petra says, “I know I’ve gone overboard, but I’ll stop.  I promise.”  Johann asks, “You’ll stop cold turkey?”  To stop something “cold turkey” is to immediately end some activity, usually something that is not good for you such as an addiction.  So if you are a  smoker – you like to smoke cigarettes – and you stop cold turkey, that means t hat you stop suddenly.  You say one day, “No more cigarettes,” and you don’t sm oke another cigarette the rest of your life – or at least the rest of that we ek!  That would be going cold turkey or stopping cold turkey.  Why “cold turkey”?   I have no idea. 

Petra says, “Well…I need to be weaned off, I think. ”  “To be weaned (weaned) off (something)” is to slowly reduce the amount or numb er of something that you are addicted to.  It’s not the same as cold turkey, it’ s not suddenly; it’s slowly.  Some people, for example, who are addicted to nicotine, will wear nicotine patches, things on their arm, or they’ll chew nicotine gum t o wean them off slowly from this addiction.  Petra says, “How about if I cut back to  10 hours a day to start?”  “To cut back” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to red uce, to decrease the number or amount of something.  Petra is saying that she n eeds to quit her addiction  

slowly.  Instead of listening for 14 hours she’ll l isten for 10 hours, which of course we know is still probably a little bit too much tim e, even for ESL Podcast. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
