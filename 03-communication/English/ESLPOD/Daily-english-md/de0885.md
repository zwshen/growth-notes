[start of dialog]

Bank Teller:  Can I help you?

Antonio:  Yes, I’d like to deposit this check.

Bank Teller:  Please fill out a deposit slip and be  sure to endorse the check on the back.

Antonio:  Here you are.  I’ve already filled out a slip and signed the check.  I’d also like to cash this other check.

Bank Teller: Sure, I can help you with that.  Here you are.  Here’s a receipt for your deposit and I’ve cashed your check.  Let me co unt out your $100:  20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

Antonio:  Thanks.  Could I also check my bank balan ce for my other account?

Bank Teller:  No problem.  You just have to swipe y our ATM card and enter your PIN.  It looks like you have a balance of $1,752.  Will that be all?

Antonio:  Oh, I have that much?  I’d like to withdr aw $80.

Bank Teller:  All right.  You’ll need to fill out a  withdrawal slip.  Why don’t you step aside while you do that so I can help the next cust omer, and when you’re done, come back to this window and I’ll help you.

Antonio:  Okay, I’ll do that.  And if I want to tra nsfer money between accounts?

Bank Teller:  You’ll need to fill out a withdrawal slip for the first account and a deposit slip for the second.

Antonio:  Got it.  This might take awhile.

Bank Teller:  No problem, sir.  We’re here all day – at least until 5:00.

Our dialogue begins with the bank teller saying to Antonio, “Can I help you?” The “teller” is usually the man or woman who you talk t o if you want to put money into your bank account or take money out of your bank ac count. Antonio says, “Yes. I'd like to deposit this check.” Antonio wants to p ut money into his bank account. That's what he means when he says he wants to “depo sit” something. In this case, he's depositing a “check.” A “check” is usual ly written on a small piece of paper that authorizes the bank to take money from o ne person's bank account and give it to another person. When you have to pay  your electrical bill or your gas bill, you may write a check. You may write on a  piece of paper and sign it in order to transfer money from your account to the pe rson or the company you are paying.

Antonio is depositing the check into his bank accou nt. The bank teller says, “Please fill out a deposit slip (slip) and be sure to endorse the check on the back.” A “deposit slip” is a piece of paper that yo u write your account information on so that the teller knows where to put this check , in whose account to put it. “Slip” is just another word for small piece of pape r. “To endorse (endorse) a check” means to sign the back of the check. Banks u sually require, though not always, that if you are going to take a check and d eposit it into your account, you have to sign the back of it to prove that you are w ho you say you are. Antonio is asked to endorse the check on the back, on the back  of the piece of paper.

Antonio does that and then says, “Here you are,” gi ving the check to the teller. “I've already filled out a slip and signed the chec k.” “To sign” means to endorse, in this case. “I'd also like to cash this other che ck.” So, now we learn Antonio has two  checks. One of them, he wants to deposit; one of t hem, he wants to cash. The verb “to cash” (cash) means typically to exchan ge a check for currency, for dollars and coins, something that you can use and s pend wherever you'd like. “Cashing a check” means getting money from a check that you can spend somewhere else. That's what Antonio wants to do. He  wants to cash this check.

Notice also that “cash” is a noun referring to curr ency, referring to money – money in the form of either paper money, bills or c oins.

The bank teller says, “Sure. I can help you with th at. Here you are. Here's a receipt for your deposit.” The bank teller takes the check from Antonio and gives Antonio a “receipt” (receipt) (the “p” is silent). The “receipt” is a piece of paper saying that you have, in this case, deposited this amount of money into your bank account.

In general, a receipt is a piece of paper, usually,  that summarizes whatever financial transaction took place. So, if you go to a restaurant and you give the waiter or the waitress, the server, your credit car d, he or she brings that back and you sign it, and you take a receipt. This is a summ ary of the money that you just spent. Nowadays, receipts can also be electronic. T hey can send you an email. If you go in to some stores, instead of giving you a p aper receipt, they will offer you the option of sending you a receipt by email. Of co urse, the real reason they offer to do this is because they want your email address so they can send you some advertisements later.

The bank teller says that she's also cashed Antonio 's check, and then she gives Antonio the money. She says, “Let me count out your  one hundred dollars.” “To count out” is a phrasal verb meaning to say the amo unt of money that you are giving someone. If you're giving someone a hundred dollars and you have five twenty-dollar bills, you would say, “20, 40, 60, 80 , 100.” That's exactly what the bank teller does with Antonio.

Antonio says, “Thanks. Could I also check my bank b alance for my other account?” Your “balance” (balance), when talking ab out money, or in this case a bank, is the amount of money that you still have in  your account – in this case, in your bank account. So, your bank balance would be h ow much money you have left in your account.

The bank teller says, “No problem.” Yes, of course.  “You just have to swipe your ATM card and enter your PIN.” You're “ATM card” sta nds for your Automatic Teller Machine card. That's the little card the ban k gives you that you can put into a machine and get money out of the machine so you d on't have to go to the bank or talk to a bank teller. That's why we call it an “automatic teller.” It's a machine teller.

“To swipe (swipe)” a credit card or a bank card mea ns to take the card and move it quickly through a narrow area that reads the ele ctronic information on the back

of the credit card, or the bank card. The teller is  telling Antonio to swipe his card, to move it quickly, so that the machine can read it .

After he swipes his ATM card, he’s supposed to ente r his PIN. “To enter” means, in this case to type, or put information into a com puter. The “PIN” (PIN) is the Personal Identification Number. Usually, it is four  digits, four numbers that you put in, that are associated with your ATM card. The  bank teller says, after Antonio does all of this, “It looks like you have a  balance of 1,752 dollars. Will that be all?” “Will that be all?” means “Can I help  you with something else? Are you finished?” Antonio says, “Oh, I have that much? ” He’s surprised at how much money he has. Then he says “I'd like to withdraw 80  dollars.” “To withdraw” (withdraw) means to take money out of an account. “ To deposit” is to put the money into the account. “To withdraw” is to take it  out of the account. That's what Antonio wants to do. He wants to withdraw $80.

The bank teller says, “All right.” Okay. “You need to fill out a withdrawal slip.” Just like the deposit slip is a small piece of paper whe n you deposit money into your bank account, a withdrawal slip is a piece of paper  you fill out with your information that you give to the bank teller so tha t he or she can take money out of your account. The teller says, “Why don't you st ep aside?” meaning “Why don't you step to one side of where I am standing while y ou do that,” while you fill out the withdrawal slip, “so that I can help the next c ustomer. And when you're done,” when you're finished, “come back to this window and  I'll help you.” The bank teller is telling Antonio that it's going to take a  little time for him to fill out his withdrawal slip so he should step away from the tel ler and let another customer come up and be helped by the teller. Then when Anto nio is ready, he can come back to the teller and give the teller his withdraw al slip.

The “window” here refers to the place where the tel ler is working in the bank. It usually isn’t a window at all, in the sense that it  looks out onto the outside of the building. It's in the inside of the building, and i t's just the place where the teller is working.

Antonio says, “Okay, I'll do that. And if I want to  transfer money between accounts?” “To transfer” (transfer) means to move y our money from one bank account to another. Antonio's asking what he needs to do if he wants to transfer money between accounts. The teller says, “You'll ne ed to fill out a withdrawal slip for the first amount and a deposit slip for the sec ond,” or the second amount. Antonio say “Got it,” meaning “Yes. I understand.” “This might take a while.”

“To take a while” (a while) means to last a long ti me, for something to need a lot of time in order to happen. It may take a while bef ore your English is perfect. It

will take a little time but if you keep working on it, it will happen. Antonio says that filling out all of these slips could “take a while. ” The bank teller says, “No problem, sir. We’re here all day, at least until fi ve o'clock.” The teller is saying that Antonio doesn't have to hurry because the bank  will be open at least until five o'clock in the afternoon.

Now let's listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
