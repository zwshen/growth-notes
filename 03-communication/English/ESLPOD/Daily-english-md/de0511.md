[start of dialogue]

George:  What are you doing?

Joan:  I’m looking through these magazines to try and deci de which plastic surgery procedures I should have next year.

George:  You’re not thinking of going under the knife .

Joan:  Yes, I am.  I’ve always wanted to improve on the w ay I look, and I’m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.  I want to look 25 ag ain!

George:  That’s ridiculous.  Nobody who is 45 can look 25.   People who get Botox, have facelifts, or tummy tucks look weird.

Joan:  That’s because they didn’t go to the best plastic sur geons.  I won’t make that mistake.  Help me decide.  Should I get liposuction  and a nose job, or should I go all out and get breast implants, too?

George:  I think you’ve gone off the deep end.  We’ve b een friends for over 20 years and you don’t need any cosmetic surgery.  You’re perf ect the way you are.

Joan:  You can’t be serious!

 George:  I’m dead serious, and if you get all of that plastic surgery, you’ll look like an over-the-hill Barbie doll, and I’m not going to b e seen in public with you.

Joan:  What’s wrong with a little plastic surgery?  I ju st want to feel better about myself.

George:  You don’t need plastic surgery to do that.  Yo u just need to spend more time with me and your other friends who like you just the way you are!

Joan:  Sagging skin and all?

George:  What sagging skin?

Joan:  I feel younger already.

The dialogue begins with George saying to Joan, “What  are you doing?”  Joan says, “I’m looking through these magazines to try and decid e which plastic surgery procedures I should have next year.”  “Plastic surger y,” sometimes called “cosmetic surgery,” is one of many different medical procedu res that involve cutting into your skin, usually to make you more attractive or more beautiful.  If you think your nose is too big, you may have plastic surgery to  make your nose smaller.  My wife thinks my mouth is too big, so she wants me to have plastic surgery to make it smaller!

Joan is interested in plastic surgery, which is very popular especially in cities like Los Angeles where everyone is trying to look beautiful, es pecially those who are on television or the movies.  I, of course, am on a podcas t, so you can guess how ugly I am!

George says, “You’re not going under the knife.”  The expression “to go under the knife” means to have surgery; not plastic surgery exclu sively, it could be any kind of surgery.  If you had a car accident you might have to have surgery, where the doctor cuts open your body.  That’s going under the kn ife.  Plastic surgery is just one type of surgery.

Joan says, “Yes, I am.  I’ve always wanted to improve on the  way I look (to make myself look better), and I’m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.”  “Wrinkles” are small lines (or folds, we might call them) in your skin, usually caused by age. As you get older, you have more wrinkles.  They may also be caused by sun

 damage.  People who like to go out into the sun and get a tan so they look younger, well, the problem is later in life then you h ave even more wrinkles and you look even older.  “Sagging skin” is skin that hangs down ; it is not as tight as it used to be.  It would be, for example, loose skin on you r face, rather than having your skin that was tight, as you would see among younger pe ople.  Not me, people who are really young!  The word “sag” (sag) has se veral different meanings in English; take a look at that Learning Guide  for some additional explanations.

Joan says, “I want to look 25 again.”  George says, “That’s ridiculous.  Nobody who is 45 can look 25.”  That’s true; I’m 45 and I will  never look 25.  In fact, even when I was 25, I didn’t look 25!  George says, “People w ho get Botox, have facelifts, or tummy tucks look weird (look strange).”  “Boto x” (Botox) is a chemical substance that is injected or put into your skin on your face  so that you have fewer wrinkles.  It makes your skin smoother.  It also make s your skin unable to move so that when you smile or try to have some expression  on your face, your skin just stays the way it is; it doesn’t move.  It looks very str ange.  It’s very popular among a lot of people here in Hollywood; the y get Botox, especially women, but not just women.  “To have a facelift” (one word) is to remove lose skin on your face, making it tighter.  The idea is to try to make you look younger. A “tummy tuck” is a surgical procedure that cuts away fat an d skin from your abdomen – from what we call your tummy, which is in the middle part of your body.  The idea of a tummy tuck is to make you look thinner .

Joan says that people who get Botox, have facelifts, or tu mmy tucks look weird because they don’t go to the best plastic surgeons.  A “surg eon” is someone who does surgery.  A “plastic surgeon” is a medical doctor who d oes surgeries that make people look better or younger.  Joan says, “I won’t make that mistake (I won’t go to any thing but the best plastic surgeons).”  I f you ever are in Los Angeles and you pick up one of the weekly entertainment m agazines or newspapers, which are often distributed for free at cof fee shops and restaurants, you can open up the newspaper or magazine and you can see advertisements from doctors who are plastic surgeons.  It’s sort of funny;  they’re so popular here in Los Angeles that they advertise in the newspaper.  Us ually, the advertisement has a beautiful woman in a bikini who has a very – how should we say – large top of her body and a very small bottom of her body, o bviously the result of plastic surgery.

Joan says, “Help me decide (meaning help me make a decision  George). Should I get liposuction and a nose job, or should I g o all out and get breast implants?”  “Liposuction” is a type of plastic surgery tha t removes unwanted fat from your belly – your abdomen, your tummy.  It pulls the  fat out of your body so

 that you look less fat.  The “nose job” is when you get su rgery to make your nose smaller or to make it have a different shape.  The exp ression “to go all out” means to do 100 percent of something, to do everything  possible, to go to the extreme, to try very hard to do something.  These are al l meanings of “to go all out.”  “They’re going to go all out on their wedding ,” they’re going to invite 500 people and spend 50,000 dollars – they’re going to go all out.  “To go out” has several different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that phrasal verb.

So, Joan is wondering if she should go all out and get  breast implants.  “To implant (something)” is to put something underneath y our skin or in your body. “Breast implants,” for women usually, are when the woma n’s breasts (her chest; the top front of her body) are changed, usually made  bigger by putting in little bags of a type of plastic – of silicone.  When I was talkin g about the advertisements for the plastic surgeons in the newspapers in Los Angeles, well, usually those are of women in bikinis who have breast imp lants.

George says to Joan, “I think you’ve gone off the deep en d.”  “To go off the deep end” means to go crazy, to stop being realistic.  George says, “We’ve been friends for over 20 years and you don’t need any cosmetic sur gery.”  Remember, cosmetics surgery is the same as plastic surgery.  “You’re perf ect the way you are.”  Joan says, “You can’t be serious (meaning you’re kid ding, right?)!”

George says, “I’m dead serious.”  When someone says they’r e “dead serious,” they’re saying they’re very serious, they’re extremely serious, they’re not joking at all.  George says, “if you get all of that plastic surg ery, you’ll look like an over- the-hill Barbie doll.”  There’s two expressions there: f irst, “over the hill” means old; it’s an informal expression, somewhat of a negative expression.  If somebody says, “You’re over the hill,” they mean that you have alre ady gotten to the top of your life, and now you’re on the second part of your lif e.  You’re old, in other words.  That’s what my nieces and nephews tell me, I’m ov er the hill: “You’re over the hill Uncle Jeff!”  A “Barbie doll” is a child’ s toy, usually a young girl’s toy. It’s a small doll that has, usually, blonde hair.  It’s b een around for several years, since probably the middle part of the 20th century.  They’re very popular.  Usually they are dolls that are very beautiful women with larg e breasts and a small waist – a small bottom.  George says, “I’m not going to be see n in public with you.”

Joan says, “What’s wrong with a little plastic surgery?  I just want to feel better about myself.”  And, of course, that’s one unfortunate reason why some women have plastic surgery, I think.  George says, “You don’t need  plastic surgery to (feel better about yourself).  You just need to spend m ore time with me and your other friends who like you just the way you are!”  Joan sa ys, “Sagging skin and

 all?”  The phrase “and all” is used to emphasize that som ething is included in the discussion.  It would be another way of “even my sagging skin .”  George says, “What sagging skin?”  Joan says, “I feel younger already,” meaning telling me that makes me feel younger.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
