Let’s get started.   > I was mugged while I was walking home last night.  This morning, I was at the police station with a sketch artist to see if we could come up with a picture of what the thief looked like.    Sketch artist:  Okay, you said that this was a man in his 40s.  Can you tell me what shape his face was: thin, round, oval, or square?  Anna:  His face was long and thin, I think.  Sketch artist:  Were his eyes more round, bulging, or squinty?  Anna:  Well, I think they were round, but not too round, and he had bushy eyebrows.  He also had a pointed nose, not a hooked one.   Sketch artist:  Take at look at this so far.  Is this right?    Anna:  His nose in the sketch is a little too turned up.  It was more straight.    Sketch artist:  What about his ears?  Were they big or small?  And his mouth?  Did he have thin or thick lips?
