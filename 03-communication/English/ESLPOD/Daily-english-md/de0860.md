This episode is a dialog between Rita and Rick, abo ut buying and selling stocks. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Rita:  I just got a hot tip from my brother to buy stock in McQ Corp.

Rick:  Your brother works for McQ Corp., doesn’t he ?

Rita:  Yeah, he’s a director in the company, so he should know if something big is brewing.

Rick:  If he’s a director and he knows something th at isn’t publicly disclosed about the company, and he’s telling you to buy stoc k, isn’t that insider trading?

Rita:  Insider trading?!  I’m not a major investor.   I don’t plan to buy so many shares that I’ll become a major shareholder.  All I  can afford are a few shares.

Rick:  Still, he’d be considered a corporate inside r and may be breaching his fiduciary responsibilities.  Giving you this tip co uld get him, and you, into a lot of trouble.

Rita:  Who are you, an SEC regulator?  People do th is kind of thing all the time, and there’s nothing shady about it.  If you’re smar t, you’d buy a few shares yourself.

Rick:  Uh, no thanks.  I don’t think I’d look good in an orange jumpsuit.

Rita begins by saying to Rick, “I just got a hot ti p from my brother to buy stock in McQ Corp.” A “tip” (tip) is advice, information tha t will help you. A “hot tip” is typically a tip about some piece of information tha t’s very timely that you need to do something about right away. This is often a term  that we use when we’re talking about secret information – in this case, the information is about buying stock. “Stock” (stock) is partial ownership in a co mpany. You can buy stock in what’s called a “stock market.” You could buy stock  in a big company like Microsoft or Apple or any other of the large compan ies. They all sell stock and you can go and buy a little piece of that company.

Rita then has a hot tip about buying stock in McQ C orp. Rick sys, “Your brother works for McQ Corp. doesn’t he?” Rita says, “Yeah. He’s a director in the company.” A “director” is a member of the company’s , the corporation’s “board of directors.” This is a group of people – men and wom en – who make important decisions about the company, all the most important  decisions, including who to hire as the president. They are made by the Board of Directors. Rita’s brother is on the Board of Directors of McQ Corp.

Rita says, “He should know if something big is brew ing.” The expression “something big is brewing” (brewing) means that som ething important is going to happen but no one knows exactly what it is. It’s se cret information. “Something big is brewing.”  Rick says, “If he’s a director an d he knows something that isn’t publicly disclosed about the company, and he he’s t elling you to buy stock, isn’t that insider trading?” Rick is saying that if Rita’ s brother is on the board of directors of McQ Corp. and he knows something that isn’t publicly disclosed, then there’s a problem. “Publicly” means that everyone k nows about it. “Disclosed” means that you tell someone. So, if you “publicly d isclose (disclose) information,” you announce it to everyone. You tell the newspaper , you tell the television stations, “This is what’s happening in my company.”

In the United States, there are very strict, very s pecific rules that you have to follow as a company. You can’t be buying and sellin g your stock based on information that you don’t tell everyone else about . That’s exactly what is happening here. Rita’s brother is using his informa tion that hasn’t been publicly disclosed to tell his sister to buy stock. That is what we call “insider trading.” “Trading” refers to buying and selling stocks. “Ins ider” (insider) refers to someone who is inside of or part of an organization or grou p, in this case, a corporation, a company. “Insider trading” is when you take the inf ormation you have about your company and you buy and sell stocks, even though no  one else knows that information. That is against the law in the United States if the company is what is called “publicly traded;” that is, if anyone can go  and buy stock in that company.

Rita says “Insider trading? I’m not a major investo r.” An “investor” (investor) is someone who “invests” (invest). “To invest” means t o buy stock in a company or to buy something that you think will be worth more money in the future. You can be a real estate investor. You could buy buildings and houses, hoping that the price goes up. By the way, that doesn’t always happ en.

Rita says she’s not a “major investor.” “Major” (ma jor) here means a very important one or a large investor. She says, “I don ’t plan to buy so many shares that I’ll become a major shareholder.” “Shares” are  what we call the individual units of stock. A “shareholder” is someone who owns  shares. So, “shareholder” here really means the same as “stockholder” – someo ne who owns shares, who owns stock in a specific company. Rita says, “All I  can afford” – all I have money for – “are a few shares” – just a couple pieces of stock, if you will. Rick says, “Still, he’d be considered a corporate insider” – h e, being Rita’s brother – “and may be breaching his fiduciary responsibilities.” We already talked about what an “insider” is. “Corp orate” (corporate) is something related to a corporation – a large compan y, in this case. So, a “corporate insider” would simply be someone who wor ks at a large company or a corporation. Rick says that Rita’s brother would be  considered a corporate insider and may be – possibly – breaching his fiduc iary responsibilities. “To breach” (breach) means to break or violate or to do  something wrong with regards to, in this case, responsibilities that you  have. If you’re on the board of directors of a publicly traded corporation, you hav e fiduciary responsibilities. “Fiduciary” (fiduciary) involves the trust that the  company has given to you, as it relates to money or investments. So, “fiduciary” is  usually a term we use when we’re talking about money and your responsibilities  as someone who has information about a company or about an individual.

Rick says, “Giving you this tip could get him” – Ri ta’s brother – “and you, into a lot of trouble.” You could possibly be breaking the  law here. Rita says, “Who are you, an SEC regulator?” “SEC” stands for the Securi ties and Exchange Commission. This is the U.S. government agency that  is responsible for regulating, for making sure that people in the stoc k market are doing what they are supposed to, are following the law. A “regulato r” (regulator) is a person who works in a government agency, a government organiza tion that is responsible for going out and making sure people are following the rules. In this case, the rule is related to buying and selling stocks.

Rita says, “People do this kind of thing all the ti me and there’s nothing shady about it.” “Shady” (shady) means dishonest, not com pletely honest. There’s something that you’re hiding. There’s something tha t you aren’t supposed to do that you are doing. That’s the adjective “shady.” W e might say, “He’s a shady

character,” meaning he’s not an honest person. He’s  not someone you should trust. There’s something strange about that person.  That’s what people say about me. Rita says, “If you’re smart, you’d buy a few sh ares yourself.” So, Rita says there’s nothing wrong with this.

Rick says, “No thanks, I don’t think I’d look good in an orange jumpsuit.” A “jumpsuit” (jumpsuit) is a piece of clothing that c overs your entire body, from your shoes up to your neck, from your ankles to your nec k. You would, perhaps, see someone who works on automobiles – a mechanic – mig ht be wearing a jumpsuit to protect his clothing underneath. However, we als o put prisoners – people who are in jail, people who have been arrested because they’ve broken the law – in jumpsuits. And it’s become common in recent years t o put them in a very bright- colored jumpsuit so in case they escape, they are e asy to catch. And the color that is often used is orange. So, when Rick refers to an orange jumpsuit, he’s talking about someone who would be arrested. He thi nks that what Rita is recommending is against the law and he doesn’t want  to go to jail.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
