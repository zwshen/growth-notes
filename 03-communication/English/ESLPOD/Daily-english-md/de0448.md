This episode is called “Making Business Contacts.”  It is a di alogue between Phan and Montel, and they’re going to use a lot of vo cabulary that would be used in the business world when you are talking about people that you want to work with or do work with.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Phan:  Hi, Montel.  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

Montel:  It’s my pleasure.

Phan:  Since I’m new here, I was hoping you might be w illing to give me some pointers on how to get new clients.  To be honest, I’ve never been on this side of the fence before and I’m a little out of my comfort zon e.

Montel:  Oh, sure, I’m glad to give you as much help as I can.  Getting clients is a bit of an art, but the key is building relationships.

Phan:  What do you mean?

Montel:  Most of my clients come to me through networking .  I get referrals from people who know me and know my track record.

Phan:  Really?  I was thinking that I needed to send ou t some direct mail or do some cold calling.

 Montel:  You may need to do that to start, but if I w ere you, I’d also spend time making connections in the business community.  Go where you t hink business prospects may be.  To woo new clients, you need to meet th em first.

Phan:  How do I find out where they’ll be?

Montel:  Again, you make contacts.  You’ve made the first step today by getting in touch with me.  I’m going to a reception tonight a nd it will be a who’s who of the business community.  Do you want to go?

Phan:  Really?  You’d let me tag along?

Montel:  Sure, but there’s a quid pro quo.  In the f uture, if you get invited to something like this, you invite me to go along.

Phan:  That’s more than fair.  I think I just got my fi rst lesson in making business connections.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Phan saying to Montel, “Hi, M ontel.  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.”  Montel says, “It’s my pleasu re,” which is something that you say when someone thanks you for doing something.  You can say, “you’re welcome,” but here, because both people probabl y want to meet, Montel says, “It’s my pleasure.”

Phan says, “Since I’m new here, I was hoping you might be  willing to give me some pointers on how to get new clients (or customers).”   A “pointer,” in this case, means an idea or a suggestion for a way to do someth ing.  We might also call it a “tip.”  “Can you give me some pointers on how  to work the television (how to operate the television set)?  I don’t understand th ese buttons.”  Phan says, “To be honest, I’ve never been on this side of the fence befo re and I’m a little out of my comfort zone.”  “This side of the fence” means in a cert ain position or a situation.  “That side of the fence” would be in anoth er or opposing situation.  So perhaps Phan was not working in this part of the company,  and is now having to do something she didn’t have to do before.  She says she’ s a little out of her comfort zone.  “To be out of your comfort zone” means th at you are in a situation that you are uncomfortable with or are unfamiliar wi th, usually because it’s new to you.

Montel says, “Oh, sure (meaning yes), I’m glad to give you  as much help as I can.  Getting clients is a bit of an art.”  To say somethi ng is “a bit (bit) of

 something” means it’s a little bit of this thing.  In t his case, it’s a little bit or somewhat of “an art,” meaning you have to know how to d o it; it’s not a science – it’s not scientific, it doesn’t follow certain rules.  Yo u have to be creative in order to do it.  Montel says, “the key is building relationship s.”

Phan says, “What do you mean?”  Montel replies, “Most of my clients come to me through networking.”  To “network” means to meet and talk to other people, usually in your area of business (your profession).  You giv e each other your telephone number, email address, address perhaps, what w e would call your “contact information,” and these are people you can call later and perhaps get business from.  So, Montel is recommending that Phan do some networking. Montel says, “I get referrals from people who know me an d know my track record.”  A “referral” is a recommendation of one perso n to another.  It’s someone saying that this person is good for what you want .  For example, if I am going to paint my house – and I really should paint my h ouse – I would, perhaps, ask my neighbor who had his house painted last month what  painter or which painting company he used.  I would get a referral from  him; he would recommend someone to me.  “Track record” means your past success, or perh aps failure.  If you have a good track record, that means that you’ve had ma ny successes; you’ve been very successful.  If you have a poor track record,  that means that you haven’t been very successful.  Here, Montel means his good  track record.

Phan says, “Really?  I was thinking that I needed to send out some direct mail or do some cold calling.”  “Direct mail” and “cold callin g” are two ways that salespeople try to get new customers.  “Direct mail” is wh en you send a letter or a brochure, some sort of information to people, and usu ally you get their names from a list of people who are in your profession or in your kind of business.  This is mail that goes to their office, sometimes even to the ir home, and you are trying to get people to respond to you.  It’s a type of adverti sement.  “Cold calling” is to call someone up on the telephone who isn’t expecting your  call, usually someone you have never talked to before.  So you call them and yo u try to get their business.  To do something “cold” means to do it without any preparation.  In this case, it means that you don’t know the person before yo u call them and they’re not expecting you to call.  It can be very difficult because most people don’t want to talk to a salesperson, so you have to be very “persistent ,” meaning you have to continue calling and calling as many people as possible for it to be successful.

Montel says that “You may need to do that (that is, dire ct mail and cold calling) to start (at the beginning), but if I were you, I’d also spend time making connections in the business community.”  A “connection,” here, means a  relationship, getting to know someone else, usually in a business or professional  situation.  Montel says, “Go where you think business prospects may be.”  A “prosp ect” is a person

 who might be interested in doing business with you, someo ne who we would call a “potential” client or customer; one of your future cust omers, you hope.  Montel says, “To woo (woo) new clients, you need to meet them fi rst.”  To “woo” someone means to try to get someone to do something for you by being very nice to that person, by understanding who that person is and what they want. So, a young man might woo a beautiful young girl: try to get her to go on a date with him.

Phan says, “How do I find out where they’ll be?” meanin g how do I know where my prospects will be.  By the way, “prospect” has a couple of  different meanings in English; just take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Montel answers Phan’s question by saying, “ Again, you make contacts.”  A “contact” is someone that you know in a business  or a professional way.  Montel says, “You’ve made the first step today by ge tting in touch with me.” To “get in touch with someone” means to contact someone,  to call them or to email them.  Montel says, “I’m going to a reception ton ight and it will be a who’s who of the business community.  Do you want to go?”  A “ reception” is a small party where people get together to drink, to eat; it’ s often something that is done before or after another large event, a speech or a con ference for example.

Montel is asking Phan if she wants to go with him to this reception, because it will be a who’s who of the business community.  The expression “ who’s who” (who’s who) is the group of people who are most important or  most active in a particular area.  So if you go to a podcasting conference or conven tion, you would find the who’s who of the podcasting world there, the most impo rtant people.

Phan says, “Really?  You’d let me tag along?”  To “tag along” means to go to an event with someone, not necessarily because you were invited.   So, if your brother is going out on a date and you say, “Can I tag  along?” he’ll probably say no.  To “tag along” means to go with someone even thou gh you weren’t invited yourself.

Montel says, “Sure, but there’s a quid pro quo.”  “Quid  (quid) pro quo (quo)” is a Latin expression meaning I will do something for you if you do something for me. It’s an exchange of favors, if you will; something you do f or something that someone else does for you.  Montel says, “In the future, if you get invited to something like this (a reception), you invite me to go a long” – so, I will let you come to my reception, but in the future, you have to let  me go to one of your receptions.  Phan says, “That’s more than fair (meaning t hat’s very reasonable). I think I just got my first lesson in making business connectio ns.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
