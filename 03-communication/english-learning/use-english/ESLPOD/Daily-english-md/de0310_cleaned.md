This episode is called “Shopping for Furniture.”  It’s a dialogue between two people who just got married, or are going to get married, and are looking for things for their new house or apartment.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Tobias:  I really don’t understand why we need new furniture.  After we’re married, we’ll just take the things from each of our two apartments and that should do the trick.  Renee:  We each have some things we can keep and use, but it would be nice to have pieces that match.  Right now, we have six dining chairs, each in a different style, and none of them are in the same style as the dining table your uncle is giving us as a wedding present.    Tobias:  Yeah, that’s true.  At least, we won’t have to shop for bedroom furniture.  We’re lucky that your parents are giving us some hand-me-down things, including a dresser, two nightstands, a headboard, and a wardrobe.  All we need is a bed.  Renee:  Yeah, we got lucky when they decided to get new furniture and to give us their old pieces.  That just leaves the living room.    Tobias:  But we already have a couch and a love seat.  Renee:  That’s true, but we still need a coffee table, two side tables, and at least two table lamps and a floor lamp.
