# English as a Second Language (ESL) Podcast Transcripts

This repository contains a collection of transcripts from the English as a Second Language (ESL) Podcast, converted into Markdown format. The goal is to provide a clean, readable, and well-structured resource for English learners.

## üìÇ Directory Structure

- `Daily-english-md/`: This directory contains the individual episode transcripts, named sequentially (e.g., `de0001.md`, `de0002.md`, etc.).

## üéì For English Learners

You can use these transcripts to supplement the ESL Podcast audio. Reading along while you listen can help improve your comprehension, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The files are in a simple Markdown format, making them easy to read on any device.

## ü§ù For Contributors

This project is currently undergoing a process of refinement to improve the structure and formatting of the transcripts for a better learning experience.

If you are interested in contributing, please refer to the **[IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md](IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md)** for detailed guidelines on formatting, structure, and best practices.
