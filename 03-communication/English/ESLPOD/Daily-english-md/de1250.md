[start of dialogue]

Rachel: What you need to do is . . .

Logan: Stop bossing me around! I know what I’m doing so back off.

Rachel: What’s gotten into you? I’m not bossing you  around. I’m trying to help you. Some people are so ungrateful.

Logan: It’s true that I’ve made my share of mistake s, but I don’t need you here to push me around calling all the shots.

Rachel: Here’s a reality check: Without me keeping an eye on you and steering you away from bad decisions, you’d be back in troub le again.

Logan: When I asked for your help, I’d forgotten ho w pushy and controlling you are. I’m not going to let you walk all over me like  you did when we were kids.

Rachel: Who is trying to walk all over you? If you think I’m being high-handed then I’m out of here.

Logan: Good. I don’t know what possessed me to ask you for help in the first place.

Rachel: Well, things never change, do they?

 Logan: Apparently not!

Our dialogue begins with Rachel saying to Logan, “W hat you need to do is . . .” Logan interrupts her. He stops her and says, “Stop”  – meaning quit – “bossing me around.” “To boss (boss) someone around” is a ph rasal verb meaning to tell another person what to do, even when you do not hav e any authority over that person. So for example, if you are at work and some one you work with starts telling you what to do, even though that person is not your boss – that is not the person in charge of you – you might consider that p erson as trying “to boss you around.” That person isn’t the one that is supposed  to tell you what to do, but he is telling you what to do anyway.

“To be bossy” (bossy) means to always be telling ot her people what they should do even though you don’t have the authority to do t hat. Now, when a parent tells a child what to do, we don’t call that being “bossy ” because we expect the parent to tell the child what to do. “Bossy” as an adjecti ve refers to people who are telling other people to do things even though they shouldn’t be or don’t have the authority to do so.

Logan says, “I know what I’m doing so back off.” Lo gan is telling Rachel “to back off.” “To back off” is a two-word phrasal verb mean ing to stop telling another person what to do, or simply to tell another person  to stop being so aggressive – to stop trying to control you. If someone is always  attacking you or always criticizing you, you might say, “You know what? Bac k off. Don’t continue to criticize me.” You might also use this phrasal verb  in a physical confrontation – that is, when another person comes close to you and  perhaps wants to fight you. You might tell that person “to back off” – to move away from you physically.

Rachel says, “What’s gotten into you? I’m not bossi ng you around.” The expression “What’s gotten (gotten) into you” is an informal expression in English meaning “Why are you so different?” It’s a question  used to express your surprise at how another person seems to have change d. You don’t understand why. Perhaps the other person is saying things that  you think are strange or unusual, or at least not typical of that person’s n ormal behavior.

Rachel says she’s not bossing Logan around; she’s t rying to help him. Then she says, “Some people are so ungrateful.” “To be grate ful” (grateful) means to be thankful, to appreciate what another person has don e. So, “to be ungrateful” means to be not thankful, not to appreciate what an other person has done.

Logan says, “It’s true that I’ve made my share of m istakes, but I don’t need you here to push me around calling all the shots.”

The expression “my share (share) of” something refe rs to your experience with something or of something. “I’ve had my share of go od times and bad times,” meaning I’ve had a certain amount of good times and  bad times – I’ve had a lot of those experiences, perhaps. Logan also says that  he doesn’t need Rachel “to push him around.” “To push someone around” is anoth er two-word phrasal verb that means the same as to boss someone around, to c ontrol another person.

He says he doesn’t need Rachel to push him around b y “calling all the shots.” The expression “to call all the shots” (shots) mean s to make all of the important decisions without letting other people have a say o r influence the decisions. Rachel responds by saying, “Here’s a reality check. ” A “reality (reality) check (check)” is an opportunity to think about what you are saying or what you believe compared to what is really happening. People use th is expression when they are trying to say to another person, “You are not reali stic” or “You don’t really understand what’s going on here, so I’m going to te ll you.”

Rachel says, “Without me keeping an eye on you and steering you away from bad decisions, you’d be back in trouble again.” Rac hel is telling Logan that he needs her “to keep an eye on” him. “To keep an eye on” someone is to watch someone, especially to make sure that person doesn’ t do anything wrong, or if we’re talking about a young child, to make sure the  child doesn’t hurt himself.

Sometimes we use this expression just to mean “Watc h my things so no one steals them.” If you’re at a cafe and you need to g o to the restroom and want to leave your computer on your table, you may ask anot her person, whom often you don’t even know, “to keep an eye on your stuff,” on  your things, while you go to the bathroom. People do this all the time, trusting  that just because the other person is sitting there at a table next to you, he won’t steal your things.

Rachel also says that she needs “to steer” Logan “a way from bad decisions.” “To steer” (steer) here means simply to guide, to make sure someone is moving in the right direction. We also use this verb when tal king about a car. We “steer” the car when we move the wheel, the round thing called a “steering wheel,” in one direction or another. You are making sure the car is moving in the right direction or the direction you want to go. Rachel says she ne eds to steer Logan away from bad decisions. That means she is there to prevent h im from making a bad decision.

Logan, however, says, “When I asked for your help, I’d forgotten how pushy and controlling you are.” “To be pushy” (pushy) is the same as to be bossy. It can also simply refer to someone who is very insistent,  who doesn’t give up, who is constantly trying to get his way by asking perhaps again and again and again. “To be controlling” means to not let other people make decisions or to try to make decisions for other people. Logan says, “I’m not go ing to let you walk all over me.” “To walk all over” someone is an expression me aning to control another person completely, perhaps by making all of the dec isions for that person.

Rachel says, “Who is trying to walk all over you? I f you think I’m being high- handed then I’m out of here.” “To be high (high) – handed (handed)” means to use your power and control over another person with out considering that person’s feelings or reactions. The expression “I’m  out of here” is an informal one meaning “I’m leaving” or “I’m no longer going to be  involved in this situation.” Sometimes it just means “I’m leaving immediately,” but often it is used in the sense of “I’m unhappy with this situation, and ther efore I am leaving right now.”

Rachel says, “I’m out of here,” and Logan says, “Go od. I don’t know what possessed me to ask you for help in the first place .” The expression “I don’t know what possessed me” is used when a person regrets his decision to do something – when a person decides that what they decided to d o before was wrong. We use it in a situation when we’ve changed our minds and are saying that we don’t even understand why we thought differently before. The expression “in the first place” can mean simply originally or in the first i nstance – at the beginning of a situation.

Rachel says, “Well, things never change, do they?” Rachel and Logan are siblings – brother and sister – and Logan thinks th at Rachel is acting just like she did when they were younger, when they were children . That’s why Rachel says, “Things never change, do they?” and Logan responds,  “Apparently not!” “Apparently” means seemingly, or it appears to be t rue.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Rachel: What you need to do is . . .

Logan: Stop bossing me around! I know what I’m doing so back off.

Rachel: What’s gotten into you? I’m not bossing you  around. I’m trying to help you. Some people are so ungrateful.

 Logan: It’s true that I’ve made my share of mistake s, but I don’t need you here to push me around calling all the shots.
