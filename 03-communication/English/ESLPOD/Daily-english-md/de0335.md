This episode is a dialogue between Sophia and her m echanic; she’s getting her car serviced.  We’ll find out with that means, and learn some car vocabulary in this episode.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sophia:  Is my car ready?

Mechanic:  I’m finished with your oil change and I replaced the oil filter.  I’ve also replaced the wiper blades in your windshield wipers .  But I’ve had a good look under your hood, and your car needs a lot of work.

Sophia:  Really?

Mechanic:  Yes, you have some serious problems.  I bet your engine is running really rough.  Your transmission is leaking, your s hocks need to be replaced, and you need new brake pads.  Your battery is very low and it should be replaced, too.

Sophia:  I can’t believe it.

Mechanic:  It’s true.  Your tires need to be rotate d, too, and I also suggest getting a wheel alignment.

Sophia:  Well, this is all a big surprise, especial ly since I just bought this used car a couple of months ago.

Mechanic:  You did?  Well, you got ripped off.  Who ever sold you this car is a crook.  Where did you buy it?

Sophia:  I bought it here!  I bought this from the owner of this garage.  He said that it was in tip-top shape!

Our dialogue begins with Sophia saying to her “mech anic,” the person who fixes a car, “Is my car ready?”  The mechanic says, “I’m finished with your oil change and I replaced the oil filter.”  When you have your  car serviced, there’s nothing wrong with the car but you need to do certain thing s to keep your car running smoothly so that you won’t have any problems.  Part  of that is usually having your oil changed.  “Oil” is what you put into the e ngine to help it work properly, so that the parts of the engine move properly – smooth ly.  An “oil change” is when you take out the oil in the engine and you put in n ew oil.  The “oil filter” is a small part of the engine that cleans the oil – takes away  the dirt in the oil or other objects so that the oil can do its job.  So when yo u change your oil, you often change your oil filter.

The mechanic says, “I’ve also replaced the wiper bl ades on your windshield wipers.”  Most cars have two windshield wipers.  Yo ur “windshield” is that piece of glass in the front of the car that protects you.   The “windshield wipers” are two long metal and plastic bars – long pieces of metal – that are on the bottom of your window and clean your window – remove the wate r from your window. They go side to side in what we would call a “parti al semi-circle,” that’s how you clean the water from your car.  For example, if it’ s raining, you need your windshield wiper.  A “wiper” comes from the verb “t o wipe” (wipe), which is to dry something with a cloth or some other instrument.  N ow, the windshield wipers have blades in them.  A “blade” (blade) is usually a small rubber or plastic piece that actually touches the window.  You don’t have m etal touching your window, you have this rubber or plastic blade that touches the window and removes the water from it.  The word “blade” has several differ ent meanings in English; take a look at our “What Else Does It Mean” section in this episode’s Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Well, the mechanic says that he’s “replaced the wip er blades in your windshield wipers.  But I’ve had a good look under your hood, and your car needs a lot of work.”  To say “I’ve had a good look” means I’ve ex amined very closely – I’ve looked at very carefully.  In this case, the mechan ic has looked carefully under the hood.  The “hood” (hood) in American English is  a large, flat piece of metal that covers the front of your car.  If your engine is in the front of your car – in

most cars it is – the “hood” is the metal that cove rs it.  It’s like a door that you lift up in order to get to the engine.  The little door in the back of your car is called the “trunk,” or the “trunk door”; in the front, it’ s called the “hood.”

So, he looked at the engine – he looked under the h ood – and the car, he thinks, need a lot of work.  Of course, whenever you go to a mechanic, many mechanics will try to tell you you need to do more work on yo ur car.  Unfortunately, mechanics don’t have a very good reputation, at lea st in the United States, for telling you the truth all the time.  That’s why it’ s so hard to find a good mechanic – probably harder than finding a good doctor.

The mechanic says, “you have some serious problems.   I bet your engine is running really rough.”  “I bet” means I’m guessing,  or I believe, “your engine (the motor of your car that keeps the car running) is ru nning really rough,” meaning it’s not working very smoothly.  “Your transmission  is leaking, your shocks need to be replaced, and you need new brake pads.”  Thes e are three parts of the car. Your “transmission” is the part of the car that tra nsmits the energy from the car’s engine to the wheels.  You can have either an autom atic transmission or a manual transmission, what we sometimes call a “stic k shift.”  In both cases, the transmission controls the “gears,” small round whee ls that help transfer the power coming from your engine and direct that, if y ou will, to the rest of the car. It controls it – it controls how fast you can go.

The “transmission is leaking.”  “To leak” means to allow a small amount of liquid to escape, usually by accident – you don’t want it to.  You could say, “My roof is leaking” – it rains and there is water coming down through my house into the inside of the house.  The roof – the top of the hou se – is leaking.  Well here, the “transmission is leaking,” meaning there’s transmis sion oil coming out of the car. It should not be, and that’s a problem.

Your “shocks” (shocks) is another word for your “sh ock absorbers.”  This is the part of the car that makes the ride smoother.  Inst ead of having the car go up and down quickly, the shocks help keep the car from going up and down as you are driving down the road and hit a bump, for example.  So, the shock absorbers need to be replaced, according to the mechanic.  the word “shock” actually has several different meanings in English; once again, take a look at the Learning Guide for this episode for more explanations.

The mechanic also says Sophia needs new brake pads.   The “brake pad” is the part of the car that stops the wheels from moving w hen you want to slow down or stop the car.  The “brakes” is the name of the syst em that stops the wheels; the “pads” are the actual parts that go against the whe el to slow it or stop it.

 The mechanic says, “Your battery is very low and sh ould be replaced, too.”  The “battery” is the part of the car that stores electr ical energy.  So, the mechanic is saying that the battery needs to be replaced as wel l.

Sophia says, “I can’t believe it.”  The mechanic sa ys, “It’s true.  Your tires need to be rotated, too.”  The “tire” is the thick rubber p art that goes around the wheel. You have a tire with a car, a bicycle, or some othe r machines.  The “tires need to be rotated,” the mechanic says.  “To rotate your ti res” means to move them in different positions.  You have typically two tires in the front, two tires in the back. To rotate them would mean to put the ones on the fr ont on the back, and some on the back on the front.

The mechanic also suggests Sophia get a wheel align ment.  A “wheel alignment” is when you make a change to the position of a car’ s wheels so that they are all going straight.  If you’re driving a car and you le t go of the steering wheel – you’re not touching the steering wheel – and you no tice your car moves to the left or moves to the right, that could be because you ne ed a wheel alignment, where the mechanic makes sure the car’s wheels are all po inted in the same direction so the car goes straight.

Sophia says, “Well, this is all a big surprise, esp ecially since I just bought this used car a couple of months ago.”  The mechanic say s, “You did?” – you did buy it a few months ago?  He’s obviously surprised.  He  says, “Well, you got ripped off.”  “To get ripped off” means to lose money beca use someone else has stolen it from you or lied about something – someone has c heated you – this is “to get ripped off.”  When someone is dishonest – when some one basically tries to steal your money, that is also another way we can use this expression.

The mechanic says, “Whoever sold this car to you,” or “Whoever sold you this car is a crook.”  A “crook” (crook) is another word  for a thief, a criminal, someone who steals things.  The mechanic asks, “Where did y ou buy it?” and Sophia says, “I bought it here!  I bought this from the owner of  this garage.”  She’s saying that she bought car where the mechanic works.  The place  where a mechanic works is called the “garage.”  We also use that word for the place where you store or park your car at home or at work, but it’s also use d as a word to describe the place where you get your car fixed, a place where there are mechanics.

Sophia says she bought the car “from the owner of t his garage.”  The owner told her “that it was in tip-top shape.”  The expression  “tip- (hyphen) top” means perfect, best, excellent, without any problems.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sophia:  Is my car ready?

Mechanic:  I’m finished with your oil change and I replaced the oil filter.  I’ve also replaced the wiper blades in your windshield wipers .  But I’ve had a good look under your hood, and your car needs a lot of work.

Sophia:  Really?

Mechanic:  Yes, you have some serious problems.  I bet your engine is running really rough.  Your transmission is leaking, your s hocks need to be replaced, and you need new brake pads.  Your battery is very low and it should be replaced, too.
