This episode is a dialogue talking about meat and h ow it is cooked, giving you some important words to describe how meat is cooked  that will become very useful to you if you ever go to a restaurant and ne ed to order meat in English. Well, I’m hungry. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chris: How do you like your steak?

Ruth: Well done. I don’t like any pink showing and I don’t mind if it’s a little charred.

Chris: I’ll cook it the way you want it, but it’ll be dry and tough.

Ruth: Yes, but a longer cooking time kills foodborn e illnesses. I don’t want to eat anything that’s undercooked.

Chris: It doesn’t have to be burnt to be safe to ea t. It’s easy to gauge when meat is done. How about if I brown each side to seal in the juices and then cook it to medium doneness?

Ruth: No, I don’t want to take any chances. I’d rat her the steak is overcooked than undercooked. Are you going to eat that?

Chris: Yes, I like my steak juicy.

Ruth: But that’s raw!

 Chris: No, it’s cooked rare, not raw. I’ll cut into  it so you can see that it’s cooked.

Ruth: It’s oozing red! That is definitely not cooke d.

Chris: I’ll prove it to you. I’ll eat this piece an d live to tell about it.

Ruth: Don’t put that in your mouth! You’re risking your health.

Chris: I think I’ll survive.

Chris begins our dialogue by saying to Ruth, “How d o you like your steak?” A “steak” (steak) here refers to a thick slice, or pi ece, of “beef” (beef). “Beef” is meat from a cow. There are many different kinds of steak that come from a cow. We’re not sure exactly what kind Chris is asking Ru th about. Ruth answers, however, that she wants her steak “well done.” A pi ece of beef that is cooked “well done” is cooked so that there is no longer an y red or pink in it – that is, there’s no longer any sign of the red meat that is typically what you see when you have a piece of beef.

Ruth says, “I don’t like any pink showing and I don ’t mind if it’s a little charred” (charred). “Charred” meat is meat that has become b lack from being cooked too long or from being too close to a source of heat.

Now, people who like their beef “charred” don’t thi nk there’s anything wrong with that. That’s the way they like it. But that’s not t he way Chris likes it.

Chris says, “I’ll cook it the way you want it, but it will be dry and tough” (tough). When we describe meat as being “tough,” we’re sayin g that it is difficult to chew. “Tough” is the opposite of “tender” (tender), which  is when the meat is soft and often full of juices, full of liquid. Chris says th at cooking the beef well done will make it dry and tough. However, not all meat that i s cooked well done is dry and tough. Apparently, however, that’s what Chris belie ves will happen if he cooks this steak the way Ruth wants it.

Ruth says, “Yes” – she oddly agrees with him – “but  a longer cooking time kills foodborne illnesses.” “Cooking time” is how long so mething is cooked, how long something is put in or over a source of heat. “Illn esses” describe diseases that your body can get that make you sick. “Foodborne” ( foodborne) refers to things that are present in food.

 “Foodborne illnesses” are illnesses you can get fro m eating food that is in a certain condition – perhaps the food was left out t oo long outside of a refrigerator. You might get sick from eating food like that. That  would be a “foodborne illness” – a disease or illness that is passed through or tr ansferred through food. Ruth says, “I don’t want to eat anything that’s undercoo ked.” Something that is “undercooked” is something that is not cooked long enough, something that is not cooked enough. The opposite of “undercooked” wo uld be “overcooked” – something that is cooked for too long.

Chris says, “It doesn’t have to be burnt to be safe  to eat.” Chris is describing the steak when he uses the word “it” here. “It” – that is, the steak – “doesn’t have to be burnt (burnt) to be safe to eat.” “Burnt” comes from the verb “to burn” (burn). If you “burn” food, you cook it too long so that it of ten becomes black. Chris thinks cooking the food to the point of being well done me ans that it will be burnt. Perhaps Chris hasn’t cooked very many steaks. I’m n ot sure.

He believes, however, that a piece of food doesn’t have to be burnt to be safe to eat. He says, “It’s easy to gauge when meat is done .” “To gauge” (gauge) is to measure something, to determine how much of somethi ng there is. The name of this episode is “Gauging the Doneness of Meat.” “Do neness” (doneness) refers to how long or how much a piece of meat has been co oked.

Just as we have the words “undercooked” and “overco oked,” we have the terms “underdone” and “overdone.” Meat that is “underdone ” hasn’t been cooked long enough. Meat that is “overdone” has been cooked too  long. Chris says it’s easy to gauge the doneness of meat. He says, “How about if I brown each side to seal in the juices and then cook it to medium doneness?”

“To brown” (brown) meat is to cook it for a short t ime, often at a high temperature, so that the outside of the meat gets c ooked and turns the color brown. Sometimes a cook will do this “to seal (seal ) in the juices (juices).” “To seal in the juices” means to cook something quickly  on the outside so that the liquid inside of the meat doesn’t escape. It stays in the meat so that when you eat the meat, it has more flavor. That’s why Chris is s uggesting to brown each side and then cook it to “medium (medium) doneness.” “Me dium doneness” is cooking meat so that there is a little bit of pink inside.

The terms we use in describing meat as they relate to how much the meat is cooked are “rare” (rare), which is when the meat is  still very red; “medium rare,” which means it’s a little more cooked but still fai rly red; “medium,” which is in between being completely cooked – no red and rare –  “medium well,” which is

when there’s a little bit of pink but not very much ; and finally, “well done,” when there is no pinkness – when the meat is completely cooked through.

Chris is suggesting cooking the steak to medium don eness. Ruth says, “No, I don’t want to take any chances” – that is, I don’t want to have any risks of getting sick. “I’d rather the steak is overcooked than unde rcooked.” She then looks at Chris’s steak and says, “Are you going to eat that? ” Chris says, “Yes. I like my steak juicy” – with lots of liquid that comes out o f the steak.

Ruth says, “But that’s raw!” (raw). Meat that is “r aw” is not cooked at all. That’s not the same as “rare,” where the meat is cooked bu t there’s still a lot of redness in the middle. Chris corrects Ruth and says, “No, i t’s cooked rare, not raw. I’ll cut into it so you can see that it’s cooked.” Ruth says , however, “It’s oozing red!” “To ooze” (ooze) is for liquid to slowly come out of so mething. In this case, the liquid is the blood from the meat that is coming out. Ruth  says, “That is definitely not cooked.”

Chris says, “I’ll prove it to you. I’ll eat this pi ece and live to tell about it.” The expression “to live to tell about” something means to do something dangerous and then be able to survive it – not to be killed b y that experience. Chris is making a joke here. He doesn’t really think that he  going to die by eating this piece of meat. So he’s sort of making fun of Ruth w ho thinks that it is unsafe, that it is dangerous for him to eat this meat that is co oked rare instead of well done. He is going to eat it and then “live to tell about it.”

Ruth says, “Don’t put that in your mouth! You’re ri sking your health,” meaning you could get sick. Chris doesn’t think so. He says , “I think I’ll survive” (survive). “To survive” is to go through a dangerous situation  and still live, and still be okay. It’s the opposite here of “to die.” Chris doesn’t t hink he’s going to die from eating meat that is not well done.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Chris: How do you like your steak?

Ruth: Well done. I don’t like any pink showing and I don’t mind if it’s a little charred.

Chris: I’ll cook it the way you want it, but it’ll be dry and tough.

Ruth: Yes, but a longer cooking time kills foodborn e illnesses. I don’t want to eat anything that’s undercooked.
