This dialogue is between Hector and Erica about som eone leaving his job because he gets a lot of money from the company. So unds weird? Well, let’s find out more. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hector: So, are you taking the company buyout? It s ounds generous.

Erica: Of course it’s generous. The company saves a  lot of money by giving buyouts to senior employees with high salaries. Wha t they get in return is a huge savings. I’ve been giving it a lot of thought, but I’m still not sure what to do.

Hector: It makes sense for me to take the buyout, s ince I’m only two years from retirement. It would bridge the gap nicely.

Erica: Yeah, but for someone like me? I’m mid-caree r and the job market is tight. There’s no guarantee I’ll land another job that pay s as well as this one.

Hector: It’s tempting, though, isn’t it, to take a lump sum? You can take time to consider your options.

Erica: My options might be limited. No, I can’t tak e the risk. I’m staying.

Hector: Well, I’m leaving.

Erica: Sure?

Hector: Sure, I’m sure. A chance to say goodbye to the rat race? I’ll be the first one out the door.

 The topic of this lesson is about “taking a buyout. ” Hector starts by saying, “So, are you taking the company buyout?” A “buyout” (buy out) is usually a large amount of money that a company gives an employee so  that the employee leaves the company. Now, why would a company do tha t? Well, Erica explains why. It’s of course to save the company money. So, the company can hire cheaper employees. This is especially popular for o lder employees who are perhaps close to retiring. Hector says the company buyout where he works “sounds generous” (generous).

Something that is “generous” is more than what you are required or perhaps expected to do. It’s often used simply to mean “a l ot.” “This is a generous amount of food.” That means it’s more than what you expect ed. It’s a lot of food. If someone says, “Oh, you’re very generous with your t ime,” that means that you give a lot of your time, probably even when you’re not being paid. The buyout, according to Hector, from the company is generous. Erica says, “Of course it’s generous. The company saves a lot of money by givin g buyouts to senior employees with high salaries.”

A “senior (senior) employee” is someone who is high  up in the organization – perhaps someone who has been there a long time, but  definitely someone who is responsible for parts of the company or who has a l ot of responsibility, and therefore probably someone who has a “high salary” (salary). “Salary” refers to the amount of money that you get paid every year to  work for a company. If you have a “high salary,” you are getting a lot of mone y. If you have a “low salary,” like me, you’re not getting very much money.

Erica continues, “What they,” meaning the people wh o own the company, “get in return is a huge savings.” “To get something in ret urn” means to receive something in exchange for what you have done or hav e given someone else. I give you $100, and I get in return a new phone, for  example, or whatever you give me for $100 – maybe a new iPhone. That would b e nice.

The company is getting, in return for its generous buyouts, “huge savings” (savings). “Savings” refers to money that you can u se in the future that you don’t have to spend, or simply money that you decide to k eep for a later day or for some other purpose. The company, by giving a huge b uyout or a generous buyout to employees, then doesn’t have to pay those  employees their salary in the future. Instead, of course, they hire or employ  new workers who receive lower salaries.

“I’ve been giving it a lot of thought,” says Erica,  “but I’m still not sure what to do.” Erica doesn’t know if she wants to take the company ’s buyout. Hector’s says, “It makes sense for me to take the buyout,” meaning it’ s logical or rational for me to take this buyout, “since I’m only two years from re tirement.” “Retirement” is usually the period later in life when you stop work ing at a regular job and do other things.

The case for Hector is that he is “two years from r etirement,” meaning he would probably normally retire two years from now. He say s this buyout, if he takes it, “would bridge the gap nicely.” The expression “to b ridge (bridge) the gap (gap)” means to make up the difference or to cover the dif ference between what you have now and what you need. What Hector means here is that it would allow him to survive until he is able to perhaps get his regu lar retirement pension or retirement salary that he will expect in two years’  time. The buyout would “bridge the gap.”

A “gap” is a space in between two things. In this c ase, I’m guessing, it’s the space between now – the space in time, if you will,  between now and when he’ll get his “pension” (pension). “Pension” is money tha t the company or perhaps the government gives you to live on when you’re not wor king when you retire. Erica’s situation is different. She says, “Yeah, but for so meone like me? I’m mid-career and the job market is tight.”

Erica says she’s “mid (mid) – career (career).” “To  be mid-career” is to be in the middle of your professional working life. Normally,  I would guess for most people, somewhere between, say, 40 and perhaps 55, although  people are working more years than they used to, so “mid-career” might for some people be even older than 55. I hope I’m in my mid-career now.

Erica says the “job market” (market) is “tight” (ti ght). The “job market” refers to the number of jobs there are, or more generally to the number of companies looking to hire people and the number of employees,  or the number of potential employees, looking for work. “The job market is tig ht,” Erica says. That means that there aren’t a lot of jobs that she could go a nd get if she quit the job she has now.

She says, in fact, “There’s no guarantee I’ll land another job that pays as well as this one.” A “guarantee” (guarantee) is basically a  promise that something will happen in the future. Erica says there’s no promise ; it’s not for sure that she will “land” (land) another job. “To land” something mean s to get something, especially something that is difficult to get. We o ften use this verb when talking

about a job. “I’m going to land a job at this compa ny.” That means I’m going to get a job at this company.

Hector says, “It’s tempting, though, isn’t it, to t ake a lump sum? You can take time to consider your options.” If something is “te mpting” (tempting), it’s attractive. It’s interesting. It makes you want to do it. If I see a piece of chocolate cake, I may say, “Well, that is tempting,” meaning it makes me want to eat the chocolate cake, which of course I know I shouldn’t.

A “lump (lump) sum (sum)” is a large amount of mone y that you get all at one time. The word “sum” here refers to an amount of mo ney. A “lump sum” is a large amount of money. The comparison here would be betwe en a “lump sum” and payments of that same amount over a period of time.  If I want to give you $500, I could give you $100 every month for five months, or  I could give it to you in a lump sum – all $500 right now.

Erica says, “My options,” or my choices, “might be limited” – that is, I might not have the freedom to do what I want to do. Then she says, deciding against taking the buyout, “No, I can’t take the risk” (risk). A “ risk” is the possibility that something bad will happen in the future. Erica says , “I’m staying,” meaning she’s not going to quit her job. She’s not going to leave .

Hector says, however, “I’m leaving.” Erica says, “S ure?” which is a short form of “Are you sure?” In this case, “Are you sure you are  leaving the company?” Hector says, “Sure, I’m sure.” Notice there’s another use of the word “sure” here to mean “yes.” So, when he says, “Sure, I’m sure,” he means, “Yes, I am sure.” I am certain. I’m going to leave the company. I have decided.

He says, “A chance to say goodbye to the rat race? I’ll be the first one out the door.” The “rat (rat) race (race)” is an expression  we use to describe the difficulties and the unpleasantness of trying to ma ke money, especially when you are competing against other people in the same comp any or perhaps even in different companies. The “rat race” is the unpleasa nt aspects, the not-so- attractive things about working in a job, especiall y one where there’s a lot of competition, in order to make money.

Hector says he wants to say goodbye to this rat rac e. He wants to be “the first one out the door,” meaning the first one to leave t he company. Interestingly, my father took a buyout from the school district where  he was working when he was 59 and a half years old. He decided he was going to  take a lump sum and retire early, and he lived a long and happy life, retiring  at the age of 59. I hope I am as lucky as he was to retire early.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hector: So, are you taking the company buyout? It s ounds generous.

Erica: Of course it’s generous. The company saves a  lot of money by giving buyouts to senior employees with high salaries. Wha t they get in return is a huge savings. I’ve been giving it a lot of thought, but I’m still not sure what to do.

Hector: It makes sense for me to take the buyout, s ince I’m only two years from retirement. It would bridge the gap nicely.

Erica: Yeah, but for someone like me? I’m mid-caree r and the job market is tight. There’s no guarantee I’ll land another job that pay s as well as this one.

Hector: It’s tempting, though, isn’t it, to take a lump sum? You can take time to consider your options.

Erica: My options might be limited. No, I can’t tak e the risk. I’m staying.

Hector: Well, I’m leaving.

Erica: Sure?

Hector: Sure, I’m sure. A chance to say goodbye to the rat race? I’ll be the first one out the door.
