This episode is a dialogue between Andy and Diane a bout getting someone to admit he did something wrong – a confession. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Andy: I got it! I got a confession.

Diane: You got a confession out of that suspect? Ho w did you do it? We’ve been after that guy for days.

Andy: I put the pressure on and he buckled.

Diane: Did you make threats?

Andy: Of course I made threats. It’s an interrogati on, not a tea party.

Diane: The confession is no good if it’s coerced.

Andy: I may have gone over the line a little, but w ho’s to know?

Diane: He knows and any half-decent lawyer will mak e mincemeat out of that confession. He’ll get it thrown out of court in a h eartbeat.

Andy: I leaned on him a little hard, but it’s not l ike I put the screws on him.

Diane: You have a lot to learn.

Andy: Do you think I should go back in there and ta lk to him?

Diane: Stay out of there. You’ve done enough damage . Rookies!

[end of dialogue]

Andy begins our dialogue by saying to Diane, “I got  it! I got a confession.” Here, “to get a confession” means to get someone else to make or give you a confession. A “confession” (confession) is when you  say that you did something wrong – when you state that you have broken the law , for example, or done something that you should not have done – in a lega l context, in a legal situation. A “confession” is when someone who broke the law te lls the police that he is guilty, that he broke the law.

The word “confession” is also used in some Christia n churches to refer to a formal act of asking for forgiveness and what’s cal led “absolution” of having done something wrong. But here we’re just talking about a confession to the police. Diane says, “You got a confession out of that suspe ct?” A “suspect” (suspect) is a person who is believed to have committed a crime or broken a law, but we don’t have any proof or evidence yet, or at least n ot very much. A suspect is someone the police believe is guilty of a crime.

Diane says, “How did you do it?” How did you get a confession out of or from that suspect? “We’ve been after that guy for days.” “To be after” someone means to be trying to get information from someone or trying  to catch or find someone. “To be after” can also be used to mean simply to be try ing to reach a certain goal or a certain objective. “I am after a victory.” I am try ing to get, I am pursuing, a victory. Here, Diane refers to being “after that guy” in the  sense of trying to get him to make a confession.

Andy says that he “put pressure on” the suspect and  “he buckled.” “To put pressure on” someone is to try to influence someone  by doing something that would persuade him to take the action you want him to take. Andy says he “put pressure on” the suspect and “he buckled.” “To buck le” (buckle) here refers to doing something that you don’t really want to do be cause another person is forcing you or pressuring you to do it.

If your daughter keeps asking for ice cream, and sh e does it over and over and over and over again, eventually you might buckle. You might say, “Oh, okay. I’ll buy you an ice cream.” This is a case where a suspe ct buckled under the pressure that Andy put on him. Diane says, “Did you  make any threats?” A “threat” (threat) is when you tell someone that if he doesn’t do what you want him to do, you will do something bad to him. You will c ause him injury or pain or something else that will make him change his mind.

 Andy says, “Of course I made threats.” He says, “It ’s an interrogation, not a tea party.” An “interrogation” (interrogation) is usual ly something that the police do with a suspect. They bring the suspect to the polic e station and they “interrogate” him. They ask him questions to see if he did anythi ng wrong, or to get information from the person. In other countries, military servi ces might also interrogate someone who is from another country, an enemy count ry.

A “tea (tea) party” is, literally, a social gatheri ng, a small party you have with friends at which you would drink tea and have perha ps little pieces of cake. “Tea parties” are much more common in countries outside of the United States. We might think of Great Britain, for example, where th ey have afternoon tea. A tea party would be a little more formal of an event. the idea in this expression, however, is that a tea party is a nice, friendly ge t-together, whereas an interrogation is not. That’s why Andy says, “It’s a n interrogation, not a tea party.” We were not there to have fun.

Diane, however, says, “The confession is no good if  it’s coerced.” The verb “to coerce” (coerce) means to force someone to do somet hing or say something often because you are threatening that person with some sort of pain or harm. Andy says, “I may have gone over the line a little,  but who’s to know?” Diane says the confession is no good, meaning the police can’t use it, if it was “coerced” from the suspect – if Andy did something to force the suspect to confess.

Andy says he may have “gone over the line” (line). The expression “to go over the line” means to do more than what you should do,  or to do more than what is acceptable. In this case, he may have coerced the s uspect, making the confession no good. Andy says, “I may have gone ove r the line” – it was possible, that is – “but who’s to know,” meaning no  one will know if we don’t tell anyone. Diane says, “He knows” – the suspect knows – “and any half-decent lawyer will make mincemeat out of that confession.”  “Half-decent” means pretty good – someone who is not the best but good enough.

Diane is saying that even a lawyer who isn’t very g ood “will make mincemeat out of that confession.” “To make mincemeat (mincemeat)  out of” something is to destroy it, to defeat it. We often use this express ion in talking about defeating someone’s argument or making someone’s argument loo k to be incorrect. It might also be used in the sense of physically attac king another person. “That six- foot-five man will make mincemeat out of anyone who  tries to fight him.”

The verb “to mince” (mince) in this case means to c hop up or to break up into smaller pieces. “Minced meat,” then, is chopped-up beef. I think in American English we would probably call it something like “g round beef.” In British English, it’s more likely to be called “minced meat” or “min cemeat.” Although, just to make things even more confusing, there is actually a dis h – it’s a kind of pie – called “mincemeat pie” which doesn’t have any beef in it. It’s sweet. It’s made with things like raisins. That’s a British food that is eaten often during Christmastime. But back to our story . . .

Diane says the suspect will get the confession “thr own out in court in a heartbeat” – or I guess, technically, the lawyer will get it “ thrown out of court.” To have something “thrown out of court” (court) means to ha ve a judge say that it can’t be used against the person in a criminal or any other kind of legal trial. So, if evidence is “thrown out of court,” the judge says n o, you cannot use that particular piece of evidence against this person – perhaps because, as in this case, it was gathered illegally.

There are rules about how you can get information that will be used against a person in a trial, and using “coercion” to get a co nfession breaks one of those rules, so the judge will “throw it out of court.” D iane says the confession will get “thrown out of court in a heartbeat” (heartbeat). “ In a heartbeat” means very quickly. The verb “to beat” is used to describe the  motion that your heart goes through when it pumps, and of course, your heart pu mps many times a minute, so it’s a very short amount of time. “In a heartbea t,” then, means quickly.

Andy says, “I leaned on him a little hard, but it’s  not like I put the screws on him.” “To lean (lean) on” someone can mean a couple of di fferent things. Here it means to try to influence or coerce someone. “To le an on” can also mean to get support from another person, so it has, in many way s, two opposite meanings. “To lean on” means in this case to pressure someone , but you could also say, “I lean on my friend.” He helps me. He supports me. “T o put the screws (screws) on” someone means the same thing as “to coerce” som eone – to force someone to do something by threatening that person.

Diane just says, “You have a lot to learn,” meaning  Andy is still not very good at what he does. Andy says, “Do you think I should go back in there and talk to him?” Diane says, “Stay out of there. You’ve done e nough damage,” meaning you’ve already made the situation bad enough. I don ’t want you going in there and making it worse. Then she ends our dialogue by saying, “Rookies!”

A “rookie” (rookie) is a person who is just startin g to work in a certain area or field. We talk about “rookie players” on a team, on  a professional baseball team.

These are players that are just starting. It’s thei r first year. New police officers who don’t have a lot of experience are sometimes ca lled “rookies” or “rookie cops,” and that’s the case with Andy. He obviously doesn’t have very much experience being a police officer yet.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
