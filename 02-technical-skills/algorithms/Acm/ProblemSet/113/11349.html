<p>You`re given a square matrix M. Elements of this matrix are M<sub>ij</sub>: {0 &#60 i &#60 n,
0 &#60 j &#60 n}. In this problem you'll have to find out whether the given matrix
is symmetric or not.</p>

<p>Definition: Symmetric matrix is such a matrix that all elements of it
are non-negative and symmetric with relation to the center of this matrix.
Any other matrix is considered to be non-symmetric. For example:</p>

<p>All you have to do is to find whether the matrix is symmetric or not.
Elements of a matrix given in the input are -2<sup>32</sup> &#60= M<sub>ij</sub> &#60= 2<sup>32</sup> and 0 &#60 n &#60= 100.</p>

<p><h4>INPUT:</h4>
First line of input contains number of test cases T &#60= 300. Then T test
cases follow each described in the following way. The first line of each
test case contains n - the dimension of square matrix. Then n lines follow
each of then containing row i. Row contains exactly n elements separated by
a space character. j-th number in row i is the element M<sub>ij</sub> of matrix
 you have to process.
    
<p><h4>OUTPUT:</h4>
For each test case output one line "<code>Test #t: S</code>". Where <code>t</code> is the test number
starting from 1. Line <code>S</code> is equal to "<code>Symmetric</code>" if matrix is symmetric and
"<code>Non-symmetric</code>" in any other case.

<p><h4>SAMPLE INPUT:</b></h4>
<code><pre>
2
N = 3
5 1 3
2 0 2
3 1 5
N = 3
5 1 3
2 0 2
0 1 5
</pre></code>
	
<p><h4>SAMPLE OUTPUT:</h4></p>
<code><pre>
Test #1: Symmetric.
Test #2: Non-symmetric.
