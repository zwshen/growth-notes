This episode is a dialogue between Hans and Freddie  about being modest and boastful. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Hans: Well, I think the choice is clear. I think we  should hire Clark. 

Freddie: To me, the choice is clear, too, but I thi nk that choice is Paul. Both Paul and Clark are qualified for the job, but Clark is a  blowhard. He was too full of himself. 

Hans: Clark may come off as a little overconfident,  but he makes a good impression. He would make a much better rep than Pa ul. Paul was just too low- key and timid.  

Freddie: Paul wasn’t timid at all. He was modest an d self-deprecating, but he also had a quiet confidence. He wasn’t trying too h ard to impress, like Clark was. 

Hans: Clark is the kind of person who stands out in  a room and gets noticed. That’s what we want in a rep trying to get new clie nts. 

Freddie: I found Clark to be overbearing. Paul, on the other hand, had a way with him. He exuded confidence without having to resort to blowing his own horn. 

Hans: I see we’re at loggerheads about this. What d o you suggest? 

Freddie: Let’s ask them both to lunch and ask Moniq ue to join us. She’s done a lot of hiring and has good judgment.  

 Hans: You mean you want Monique to make the call so  neither of us will be blamed for picking the wrong person.  

Freddie: I always thought you were quick on the upt ake.

Our dialogue begins with Hans saying to Freddie, “W ell, I think the choice is clear” – I think the person we should pick is obvio us. “I think we should hire Clark.” “To hire” (hire) means to give the job to s omeone. Hans thinks they should give the job to Clark. Hans is talking with Freddie. Normally, when you hear the name “Freddie” in English, you think of a boy or a man. “Fred” (Fred) is definitely a man’s name, but some women with names like Frederica might use – as a nickname, or short name – “Freddie,” and that’ s the case here.  

Freddie says, “To me, the choice is clear too, but I think that choice is Paul.” Freddie doesn’t agree with Hans. She says, “Both Pa ul and Clark are qualified for the job, but Clark is a blowhard.” A “blowhard”  (blowhard) – one word – is someone who likes to talk a lot, but who’s very arr ogant and who likes to, we would use the verb, “boast” (boast). “To boast” mea ns to talk about how great you are, how wonderful you are. 

Normally the word “blowhard” is an adjective used t o describe someone who talks too much, and often in an arrogant way. It’s definitely an insulting term. You would never, ever, ever, ever, ever want to call yo ur boss a blowhard, at least not when your boss is listening. Freddie thinks Clark i s a blowhard. She says, “He was too full of himself.” “To be full of yourself” means to think that you are better than other people. It means that you think you are wonderful, great, better than the other people around you.  

Hans says, “Clark may come off as a little overconf ident, but he makes a good impression.” “To come off as” something means to gi ve the impression of being a certain way – to do or say things that give people a certain idea about who you are. If someone “comes off as friendly,” he or she is acting in a way that makes you think that he or she is friendly. Hans says tha t Clark comes off as “a little overconfident.” The prefix “over-” (over) usually m eans too much. “Overconfident” would describe a person who thinks he’s better than  he really is.  

Hans, however, thinks Clark “makes a good impressio n,” meaning he is a good person perhaps to represent the company. He says, “ He would make a much better rep than Paul.” A “rep” (rep) is a represent ative, often someone who is  

selling something for the company, selling services  or products for the company. Your rep is often the same as your salesperson, but  not always. Sometimes your rep in a company is merely the person who you conta ct if you have problems.  

Hans says, “Paul is just too low-key and timid.” “T o be low-key” (key) means to be calm, to be quiet, to be very relaxed – maybe a little too relaxed. “Timid” (timid) is someone who is shy, who doesn’t seem to have a lot of confidence. To describe someone as “low-key” is not necessarily to  criticize him or her. However, “timid” is definitely a more negative way of describing a person, especially someone in a business environment. You d on’t want someone representing your company to be timid. You don’t wa nt them to be shy. You don’t want them to show a lack of confidence.  

Freddie disagrees. She says, “Paul wasn’t timid at all,” meaning he wasn’t timid even a little bit. “He was modest and self-deprecat ing,” but he also has “a quiet confidence.” “To be modest” (modest) means to be hu mble – not to talk about how great you are, or think that you are more impor tant than everyone else. “Self (self) – deprecating (deprecating)” means critical of yourself, often in a funny way. Someone who is self-deprecating is someone who  makes fun of himself, who doesn’t think that he is very important or more  important than the people around him. We like people who are self-deprecating  and modest, who don’t think that they are better than the rest of us.  

Freddie says that Paul has a “quiet confidence.” Th e term “quiet (quiet) confidence” is used to describe someone who realize s they – he or she – has abilities, but doesn’t brag about it. If you say th is woman has a quiet confidence, you mean she knows that she can do the job. She’s c onfident she can do the job, but she doesn’t brag about it. She doesn’t boast ab out it. “To brag” (brag) means the same as to boast – to tell people how important  you are, how good you are at something.  

Freddie says, “Paul wasn’t trying too hard to impre ss.” “To try too hard” at something means to be doing it too much. “To impres s” (impress) means to try to get other people to think that you are good, to try  to get other people to have a good opinion of you. Hans says that “Clark is the k ind of person who stands out in a room and gets noticed.” If you “stand out,” yo u are someone who other people notice, other people see, especially in a go od way.  

We may talk about a “standout student,” using the e xpression “standout” as an adjective. A “standout student” would be a student who does better than any of the other students in the class. “To stand out” as a verb means to act in such a way that other people notice how good you are. Some times you can stand out in  

a bad way, I suppose. There’s an expression in Engl ish, “He stands out like a sore (sore) thumb.” “To stand out like a sore thumb ” means to be very noticeable, but in a bad way.  

Here, however, Hans is using it in a good way to de scribe Clark. He says, “That’s what we want in a rep to get new clients.” So, now we see the rep more as a salesman, because Hans wants the rep to get new cli ents. “Clients” (clients) are customers, usually customers that you have for some  service you provide.  

Freddie disagrees. Freddie says, “I found Clark to be overbearing.” Someone who is “overbearing” (overbearing) is someone who i s perhaps a little bit too aggressive or too forceful in a situation. Someone who is “overbearing” would be someone who talks a lot and perhaps doesn’t let you  talk, or gives their opinions a little bit too strongly in such a way that no one  else really wants to talk with this person in the room.  

Freddie says, “Paul, on the other hand, had a way w ith him.” This is an expression you might use when you’re not quite sure  why you like someone, but you like the way they act. You like the things they  do. Freddie says that Paul “exuded confidence without having to resort to blow ing his own horn.” “To exude” (exude) means to display some quality or some emoti on. “To exude confidence” means to show other people that you are confident.  

“To resort to” something means to have to do someth ing even though you don’t really want to, but you think it’s necessary in ord er to accomplish what you want to get done. “I don’t want to resort to violence.” That means I don’t want to have to use violence. We always use “to resort to” for a ctions that you don’t want to do, but you may think necessary.  

Freddie says Paul doesn’t have to resort to “blowin g his own horn.” “To blow (blow) your own horn (horn)” means to brag or to bo ast – to say good things about yourself. Hans and Freddie don’t agree. Hans says, “I see we’re at loggerheads about this.” “To be at loggerheads” (lo ggerheads) means to be in a disagreement in such a way that you don’t think you ’re going to be able to solve the problem or to come to an agreement.  

Hans asks Freddie what she suggest they do. Freddie  says, “Let’s ask them both to lunch and ask Monique to join us.” Freddie’s ide a is to have the two people come to lunch and have a third person from the comp any join them so that she can give her opinion. Freddie says, “Monique has do ne a lot of hiring and has good judgment.” “To have good judgment” means that you are good at deciding whether something is good or bad.   

 Freddie’s solution is to ask Monique to go with the m to lunch and basically to have her make the decision. Hans understands what F reddie is doing here. He says, “You mean you want Monique to make the call s o neither of us will be blamed for picking the wrong person.” “To make the call” means to make the decision, especially a difficult decision. Freddie is suggesting that Monique make the decision so that if it’s the wrong decision, Fr eddie and Hans won’t be blamed. That is, people won’t say it was their fault for hi ring this person.  

Freddie says, “I always thought you were quick on t he uptake.” The phrase “to be quick on the uptake” (uptake) means to understand s omething very quickly, to be a fast learner. Freddie is saying that Hans has und erstood the reason for inviting Monique to lunch and making the decision for them v ery quickly. It is, of course, so that Freddie and Hans won’t get into trouble for  making the wrong decision. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
