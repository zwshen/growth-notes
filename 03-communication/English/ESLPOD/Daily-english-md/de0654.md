This episode is called “Talking About Sound and Vol ume.”  It’s a dialogue between Delilah and Josh.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Delilah:  Could you turn that down? 

Josh:  What?   

Delilah:  Could you turn your music down? 

Josh:  Oh, sure.  Is there a problem? 

Delilah:  No, there’s no problem.  I was just tryin g to do some reading and the ear-splitting music coming from your room made it h ard to concentrate. 

Josh:  Sorry.  I didn’t think it was that loud.  I didn’t turn it up, I swear.  The volume control is in the same place it always is, n ot one decibel higher. 

Delilah:  That may be true, but those high-pitched squeals coming out of your speakers are really grating.  And what was that ban ging sound? 

Josh:  Oh, I was just using this hammer to fix my c hair.  I’m done.   

Delilah:  And what was that thumping noise? 

Josh:  Thumping noise?  Oh, I was lifting weights a nd dropping them back down on the floor.   

Delilah:  I see.  If you could please keep the volu me to a moderate level, I would appreciate it.  

 Josh:  No problem.  I’ll be as quiet as a mouse – a s I always am.

Delilah begins our dialogue by asking Josh a questi on; really, she’s making a request.  “Could you turn that down?”  “To turn (so mething) down” or “to turn (something) up” means to decrease, turn it down, or  increase, turn it up.  In this case, really we’re talking about the sound – the “v olume,” how loud something is. You could also turn up the heat if you had, for exa mple, an adjustable heater, but the phrase is most often used when talking about th e loudness – the sound on a television, or a computer, or a radio, and so forth .  There are actually several different phrasal verbs that come from “turn,” you can find some of those in our Learning Guide. 

Josh says, “What?”  He can’t hear Delilah because h is music or whatever he’s listening to is so loud.  Delilah says again, “Coul d you turn your music down?” Josh says, “Oh, sure.  Is there a problem?”  Delila h says, “No, there’s no problem.  I was just trying to do some reading and the ear-splitting music coming from your room made it hard to concentrate.”  Here,  Delilah is being sarcastic when she says, “No, there’s no problem.”  In fact, she means yes, there’s a big problem.  She was trying to do some reading, but Jo sh had ear-splitting music on in his room.  “Ear-splitting” is something that is so loud it hurts your ears.  It’s something that is so high in pitch, perhaps, that i t is painful to listen to.  Delilah says that she can’t read because she can’t concentr ate.  “To concentrate” means to focus your attention on something without worryi ng about or, we would say, being distracted by other things. 

Josh says, “Sorry.  I didn’t think it was that loud  (meaning as loud as you think it is).  I didn’t turn it up, I swear.”  “To swear” (s wear) means to insist that you are telling the truth, to say very strongly I am tellin g you the truth or I will do what I say I will do.  Josh swears that he did not turn it  up; he did not increase the volume.  He says, “The volume control is in the sam e place it always is, not one decibel higher.”  The “volume control” is, you can guess, the thing that you use to turn the sound up or down on radio, a television, a n iPod, and so forth.  Josh says that the volume control is in the same place i t always is, not one decibel higher.  A “decibel” (decibel) is a measurement of how loud something is.  We talk about something being two miles from here; “mi les” is a way of measuring something.  “Decibel” is how we measure how loud so mething is.  It can also be used to measure the strength of a radio signal for example, but the more common use is to talk about loudness.  Decibels are  in what we call a logarithmic scale, for the mathematicians out there.  If you in crease something by three  

decibels you’ve made it twice as loud.  Josh says t hat the sound is not one decibel higher than it used to be.  Decibels is alm ost always a comparison between one level versus another. 

Delilah says, “That may be true, but those high-pit ched squeals coming out of your speakers are really grating.”  “High-pitched” is a very high sound, like this, like a soprano.  Or someone like me; a man who sing s in a high voice is said to be singing “falsetto.”  The Bee Gees, for example, often sang in falsetto in the 1970s: “How deep is your love, is your love?  How d eep is your love?  I really need to love.”  Pretty bad, huh?  Yeah, they were!  Well, Delilah i s talking about high-pitched squeals.  A “squeal” (squeal) is a lou d, high sound.  Sometimes it can mean that you are very happy or excited.  You c an have squeals of laughter. Or, it could be a very unpleasant sound coming out of a radio or a loud speaker. A “speaker,” speaking of speakers, is the part of t he radio or television or thing you hook up to your computer where the noise comes out.  Delilah says that the high-pitched squeals coming out of Josh’s speakers are really grating (grating). A “grating” sound is an unpleasant one, an irritati ng one, something that bothers you a lot.  It might even make you angry.   

Delilah also asks Josh, “what was that banging soun d?”  “To bang” is to make a very loud, often deep sound that lasts for a short period of time.  When you take two things – two glasses, and you hit them against each other, we would say you bang them against each other, you make a banging so und.  I have my cup of tea here – it’s, um, English Breakfast tea today – and a glass of water, and if I bang them together [bang, bang, bang] they make a bangin g sound. 

Josh says, “Oh, I was just using this hammer to fix  my chair.  I’m done (I’m finished now).”  A “hammer” (hammer) is a tool that  has typically a wooden handle, something that you grab onto with your hand s, and it has a very heavy piece of metal on the top.  You use it to hit nails ; to push nails into the wall you use a hammer.  Hammer, of course, was also a 1980s singer, M.C. Hammer, but we’re not going to sing any of his songs today! 

Delilah says, “And what was that thumping sound?”  A “thumping” (thumping) is a loud sound, but one that you can’t hear very clearl y.  It’s usually something in the distance, but you can tell by the sound that it is a very loud sound and that if you were next to it, it would be very loud in your ears .  Delilah asks what Josh’s thumping sound, or thumping noise was.  Josh says, “Thumping noise?”  You should know, by the way, that “noise” is usually a word we use to talk about sound that we don’t want to hear or unpleasant soun d.  The sound of my neighbors’ children yelling and screaming and squea ling; that’s noise! 

Josh says, “Oh, I was lifting weights and dropping them back down on the floor.” “To lift weights” is to try to build your muscles b y lifting very heavy objects. That’s what Josh was doing, and when he put them ba ck down on the ground, what we would call the weights, well, that made thi s thumping sound.     

Delilah says, “I see.  If you could please keep the  volume to a moderate level, I would appreciate it.”  A “moderate” level is someth ing not too loud, not necessarily soft, something in the middle.  Not too  big, not too small.  Josh says, “No problem.  I’ll be as quiet as a mouse – as I al ways am.”  The expression “to be as quiet as a mouse” means to be extremely quiet , not to make any noise.  A mouse, of course, is a small, little, typically whi te animal that because it is so small you would never hear it or rarely hear it.  T hat’s not always true, however. Sometimes you actually can hear mice – mice being t he plural of mouse, of course.  We’re not talking about the mouse sitting in front of your computer that controls the cursor on your computer screen, that’s  a different kind of mouse. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Delilah:  Could you turn that down? 

Josh:  What?   

Delilah:  Could you turn your music down? 

Josh:  Oh, sure.  Is there a problem? 

Delilah:  No, there’s no problem.  I was just tryin g to do some reading and the ear-splitting music coming from your room made it h ard to concentrate. 

Josh:  Sorry.  I didn’t think it was that loud.  I didn’t turn it up, I swear.  The volume control is in the same place it always is, n ot one decibel higher. 

Delilah:  That may be true, but those high-pitched squeals coming out of your speakers are really grating.  And what was that ban ging sound? 

Josh:  Oh, I was just using this hammer to fix my c hair.  I’m done.   

Delilah:  And what was that thumping noise? 

Josh:  Thumping noise?  Oh, I was lifting weights a nd dropping them back down on the floor.   

Delilah:  I see.  If you could please keep the volu me to a moderate level, I would appreciate it. 

Josh:  No problem.  I’ll be as quiet as a mouse – a s I always am.
