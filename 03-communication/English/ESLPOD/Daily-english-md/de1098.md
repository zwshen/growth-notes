This episode is a dialogue between Theo and Mandy a bout riding in a very big, luxurious car called a limousine. Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Mandy: Whoo! Whoo!

Theo: Hey, get down from there. You shouldn’t be st icking your head out of the sunroof.

Mandy: I just wanted to get some air. This stretch limo is amazing.

Theo: Well, I thought I’d rent one and take you to the prom in style.

Mandy: This is the height of luxury. You’ve really outdone yourself.

Theo: Thanks, but maybe we should be careful not to  spill drinks on the seats.

Mandy: Everybody drinks and parties in the back of a limo. Why else would they have a wet bar?

Theo: Well, we shouldn’t be drinking out of it. We could get into trouble.

Mandy: The chauffeur doesn’t know what we’re doing back here. The partition is up and it’s soundproof.

Theo: But he could hear us on the intercom system. Let’s just relax and enjoy the ride.

Mandy: You can do that, but I’m going to blast the music and have some fun.

 Theo: This isn’t a party bus.

Mandy: No, but it could be a party limo! You’re bri lliant. Let’s go pick up a few of my friends. We’ll turn this into a great party.

Theo: What about the prom?

Mandy: We’ll get there, but first we’re going to ha ve a pre-party in our own party limo. What a great idea!

Theo: Me and my big mouth.

This episode is all about a “limousine” (limousine) . A limousine is a big car, often a car that has six, eight, or even more doors on it , that is used for special events or for very special people. It’s a big car. It’s wh at we might call a “luxury car.” You can often put six, eight, perhaps ten or more peopl e in a limousine, depending on how big it is.

Mandy begins our dialogue by shouting, “Whoo! Whoo! ” or something like that. Theo says, “Hey, get down from there.” We tell some one to “get down” from somewhere when they have climbed up or gotten on to p of something that they shouldn’t be on – or in this case, that they are st anding up when they should not be standing up.

Theo says to Mandy, “You shouldn’t be sticking your  head out of the sunroof.” “To stick (stick) your head out of” something is to  put your head through some sort of opening, usually a window, but here Mandy is sticking her head out of a “sunroof” (sunroof). The “roof” of a car is the top  of the car. We use that same word “roof” to describe the top of a house or a bui lding. A “roof” is on the outside of a house or a building or, in this case, a car. T he inside top of a room inside of a house or building is called the “ceiling” (ceilin g).

We’re talking, in this dialogue, about a “sunroof.”  A sunroof is basically a door that is at the top of the car – cut into the roof –  that you can open and stick your head out of. Now, there is also another similar con cept that is actually more popular in cars today, called a “moonroof.” A moonr oof is a window at the top of the car, cut into the top of the car. You can’t sti ck your head out of it, but you can see out of it.

Moonroofs usually have covers on them so you can op en or close the cover depending on whether you want light or not inside of the car – coming from the top, of course. Mandy says, “I just want to get som e air.” People use that expression “to get some air.” It means to go outsid e and breathe in fresh air. You can do that in most places except here in Los Angel es, where the air is so polluted you’re probably better off staying inside.

Manny continues, “This stretch limo is amazing.” “L imo” (limo) is short for “limousine.” A “stretch (stretch) limo” is a very l ong limousine. Now, limousines are very long cars anyway, but a stretch limo is a really long limousine. You’ve probably seen one, or at least seen one in the movi es.

Some people get a limousine for their wedding day a nd they like to ride in the limousine before the wedding – or I guess after the  wedding, really. I don’t know. I didn’t have a limousine for my wedding. I had a b icycle. Yeah, my wife and I, after we got married, we got on a bicycle – you kno w, one of those bicycles for two – and then we pedaled away. We rode to the part y, to the reception. Really.

Mandy is in a stretch limo and she thinks it’s amaz ing. Theo says, “Well, I thought I’d rent one and take you to the prom in st yle.” Now we learn exactly why Mandy and Theo are in a limo. They’re going to some thing called the “prom” (prom). The prom is a formal dance party that is po pular in many American high schools, and it has been for many years. It’s usual ly during the spring of the school year and is primarily for the students who a re in their senior or last year – the “graduating students,” we might call them.

Prom is one of the few occasions where high school students get dressed up very nicely, and it’s considered a big party night for couples. To go to the prom is considered sort of part of one’s high school experi ence in the United States. Not everyone goes to the prom. I didn’t go to the prom.  Why? Well, I didn’t have a girlfriend. Sad, I know.

In our dialogue, Theo wants to take Mandy “to the p rom in style.” “In style” means in a fashionable, popular way, often one that costs  a lot of money. If you say, “I’m going to do something in style,” you mean you are g oing to do it in a way that other people will admire, perhaps, and that also mi ght cost you a little money. Some children of richer parents will get a stretch limo or a limo for their prom night.

Mandy says, “This is the height of luxury.” The “he ight (height) of” something is an extreme example of something or the strongest ex ample of something. It could also refer to the biggest amount of something . “Luxury” (luxury) is

something that is very comfortable – often, again, something that costs a lot of money. So, “the height of luxury” would be the most  luxurious situation you could imagine.

Mandy says to Theo, “You’ve really outdone yourself .” “To outdo” (outdo) – one word – “yourself” is to do something better than an yone thought you could do, to do something better than you have done it before. W e might also define this verb as “to surpass expectations.”

Theo says, “Thanks, but maybe we should be careful not to spill drinks on the seats.” “To spill” (spill) means to accidentally ca use a liquid to leave its container. So, for example, if you have a glass of water and y ou move your hand or arm too quickly, the water might spill out of the glass – it might come out of the glass. Theo is warning Mandy not to spill drinks on the se ats of the car.

Mandy says, “Everybody drinks and parties in the ba ck of a limo. Why else would they have a wet bar?” A “wet bar” is usually a smal l counter, a small piece of furniture that has a small sink in it, used to mix alcoholic drinks. Now remember, these kids are in high school, and of course they s houldn’t be drinking, legally, if they are in high school. Theo says, “Well we should n’t be drinking out of it,” meaning we shouldn’t be taking drinks out of this w et bar.

Mandy says, “The chauffeur doesn’t know what we’re doing back here. The partition is up and it’s soundproof.” The “chauffeu r” (chauffeur) is the person whose job it is to drive the car – in this case, to  drive the limousine. The “partition” (partition) is the thing that divides the place where the driver is and those in the other part of the limousine, in the ba ck part of the limousine. A partition is anything that divides a room or a spac e into two different sections.

“The partition is up,” Mandy says, meaning that the re is something like a wall between where the chauffeur is, the driver is, and where they are sitting, so the driver can’t see them. Mandy also says that this pa rticular partition is “soundproof” (soundproof). If something is soundpro of, you can’t hear what’s on the other side of it. Theo says, “But he could hear  us on the intercom system.” An “intercom (intercom) system” is a system that allow s you to talk to people in another room of a house or a building, usually one that is at a distance from where you are.

The house where I grew up had an intercom system. I t was three stories, or three levels, and my parents wanted to be able to yell at  us – I mean, talk to us – when we were on the top floor, in our bedroom, so they p ut in an intercom system, which also allowed them to listen to us through the  intercom – and that’s what

Theo is talking about here. He’s saying the chauffe ur could listen to them talking through the intercom system in the limousine.

He says, “Let’s just relax and enjoy the ride.” Man dy says, “You can do that, but I’m going to blast the music and have some fun.” “T o blast (blast) music” means to play it very loudly, as teenagers sometimes do. Theo reminds Mandy that “This isn’t a party bus.” A “party bus” would be a large bus, a large vehicle that has been modified so that people can have a party in it as it is moving them one place to another.

This has become popular I guess recently, at least here in Los Angeles. People have these big buses that they use for parties. See ms kind of strange to me, but then again, many things here in Los Angeles seem st range to me. Mandy says, “No” – this isn’t a party bus – “but it could be a party limo!” Then she says, “You’re brilliant,” meaning you’re very intelligent . “Let’s go pick up a few of my friends,” meaning let’s go to my friends’ houses an d get them to come in to the car or ride in the car with us.

“We’ll turn this into a great party,” Mandy says. T heo says, “What about the prom?” meaning “Aren’t we going to go to the prom?”  Mandy says, “We’ll get there, but first we’re going to have a pre-party in  our own party limo.” A “pre (pre) – party” would, I guess, be the party that happens before the main party. “What a great idea!” Mandy says.

Theo ends the dialogue by saying, “Me and my big mo uth.” This is a phrase we use when you regret what you have said, when you wi sh that you had not said something that you had said. The reason you regret it or feel badly about saying it is because another person took you seriously and  actually did what you said or what you suggested even though that wasn’t really w hat you had in mind or wasn’t what you intended. It could also be used whe n you say something that gets you in trouble, something that you shouldn’t h ave said.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
