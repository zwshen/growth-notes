This episode is a dialogue between Bruno and Tamara ab out watching sporting events that are “competitive,” meaning someone wins and s omeone loses. That’s a pretty broad category, but we’ll talk about some  vocabulary that you would use in a sporting event such as a football game or a baseball game.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bruno:  Hey, what are you doing?  Give me back that remo te!

Tamara:  The movie I want to watch is on right now.  D o you mind?

Bruno:  Of course I mind!  I’m watching the playoffs.  C an’t you see that?

Tamara:  The playoffs?  Oh, I’ll watch with you.

Bruno:  You?  You don’t know anything about sports.

Tamara:  It doesn’t matter.  I always root for the und erdog.  Our team will be victorious!  Go team!

Bruno:  Fine, but I’m rooting for the other team.  Let’s just watch the game, okay?

Tamara:  Your team is going to get pounded.  We will  be the champions!

Bruno:  Please, can I just watch this game in peace?  I’ve  been waiting for it all season.

 Tamara:  Oooh, somebody is a little testy.  I think it’s b ecause you know you’re backing a losing team.  You can’t stand being on the lo sing side.  Am I right? Your players are running scared already.  I can tell.

Bruno:  I’m just trying to follow the game.

Tamara:  Look at that!  Your best player just choked.  H ow could he have missed such an easy shot?

Bruno:  If you don’t be quiet, I’ll show you what it f eels like to get  choked!

[end of dialogue]

Bruno says to Tamara, “Hey, what are you doing?  Give me  back that remote.” “Hey” is used to get someone’s attention; sometimes it ju st means “hi.”  But if you say it with the right intonation like “hey!” then usuall y it’s because you’re angry or upset.  Bruno is upset with Tamara because she took away  his remote. “Remote,” here, stands for remote control; it’s a small device you use to control, for example, your television set or your cable or satelli te TV box.  That is what “remote” means here, but there are other meanings of this word in English, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explan ations.

Tamara says, “The movie I want to watch is on right now.”   “Is on” meaning is currently showing on the television.  “Do you mind?” mea ning is it okay; that’s an informal way of asking someone to stop what they are doi ng, usually because it is bothering you.  So for example, you may be eating at a restaurant and the person next to you is talking loudly on their cell phone, which I absolutely hate.  I could turn to them and say, “Excuse me, do you mind?  We’ re trying to eat here.” I probably wouldn’t do that, especially if they were big ger than I am, but that’s the idea.  You would probably only say it to someone you know;  it’s not something you would say to, say, your boss – unless you don’t mind losi ng your job!

Bruno says, “Of course I mind!” meaning no, I’m not goin g to stop what I’m doing; I am bothered by your request.  He says, “I’m watching the  playoffs.”  The “playoffs” are games that are played at the end of a sea son.  For example, in baseball the season begins in April and it ends in late September.  Then after, in October we have the playoffs; the best teams play against each other for the championship.

Tamara says, “The playoffs?  Oh, I’ll watch with you.  “B runo says, “You!”  He’s very surprised that Tamara wants to watch sports with him.  He says, “You don’t know anything about sports.”  Tamara says, “It doesn’t mat ter (it’s not important

 that I don’t know).  I always root for the underdog.”  “To root (root) for a team” means to cheer for them.  That is, to be in favor of them, want them to win: “I’m going to root for the University of Minnesota.”  That’ s my university, so when they play a football game, I am rooting for them.  In base ball, of course, I root for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Well, Tamara says that she always roots for the underdog.  By the way, “root” has a couple of different meanings in English as well.  Once again, take a look at that Learning Guide for some more explanations.  She’s rooting for the underdog. The “underdog” is the team that is not expected to win,  the team that you believe is the weakest.  So when the United States plays soccer in t he World Cup, they’re probably the underdog, meaning no one really e xpects them to win the championship.  She says, “Our team will be victorious!”  “T o be victorious” means to be the victor, the winner.  “Go team!” she says.  Oft en if you are at a game and you want to cheer, that is, you want to express your supp ort for your team out loud, you use the verb “go,” like “Go Dodgers,” means I want the Dodgers to win. You are telling them to play well, if you will.

Bruno then says, “Fine (okay), but I’m rooting for the o ther team.  Let’s just watch the game, okay?”  Tamara says, “Your team is going to get  pounded.”  “To get pounded” is an informal expression meaning to get beate n badly; they’re going to lose by many, many points.  Tamara is doing what a lot o f sports fans do, she’s saying something negative about the other team.  “Your team is going to get pounded,” they’re going to be defeated by a large score .  Tamara says, “We will be the champions!”  The “champions” are the winners, the victors.

Bruno says, “Please, can I just watch this game in peace?”  “To do (something) in peace” means to do it quietly, calmly, without other people making noise or talking or shouting.  I was in the library – public libr ary this afternoon and there was a woman there sitting next to one of the computers,  and she starts talking very loudly on her cell phone.  Did I mention that I r eally hate people who talk loudly on their cell phones in public?  Well, I’m sure t hat the other people in the library wanted to read in peace, meaning without bein g disturbed by loud noises. Unhappily, that is almost impossible nowadays.  But now I ’m sounding like an old man, aren’t I?

Bruno says, “Please, can we just watch this game in peace.  I’ve been waiting for it all season.”  The “season” is the time – the months i n the year when the regular games are played; that’s called the “regular season.”  After that, when you have the playoffs, that’s called, at least in baseball, the “ post season,” after the regular season.

 Tamara says, “Oooh, somebody is a little testy.”  “To be te sty” (testy) means to be easily angered or frustrated.  We might use the wor d “irritable,” someone who gets irritated, who gets bothered by something.  Tamara  says, “I think it’s because you know you’re backing a losing team.”  “To back (som ething or someone)” is to support them.  It could mean here to r oot for them.  In business, if you are backing someone, you are giving them money for their business.  You are an investor; you would be called a “backer,” someone who backs a business. Here, Tamara means that Bruno is rooting a team that she says is going to lose. Tamara says, “You can’t stand (meaning are very bothered b y; you are unable to tolerate or put up with the fact that you are) on the  losing side.  Am I right?  Your players are running scared already.  I can tell (I can see) .”  “To run scared” means to be frightened or worried that something is go ing to happen – something bad is going to happen, especially with your job or perh aps in a competition like a sporting event.

Bruno says, “I’m just trying to follow the game.”  “To f ollow the game” means to pay attention to what is happening.  Tamara says, “Look at that!  Your best player just choked.”  In sports, or in any competition, whe n you say someone “chokes” (chokes), you mean they do not perform well, usual ly because they’re nervous or under too much pressure, and they are not abl e to do what they would normally do.  That’s to choke.  “To choke” also mea ns not to be able to breathe.  If you eat something and it gets stuck in your throat, you could choke; you would perhaps pass out, even die because you were not getting oxygen into your lungs – into your body.  But here, it’s simply means t hat someone is not performing very well.

Tamara says, “How could he have missed such an easy shot?”  Ho w was it possible?  Because it was so easy, the player should have made  this shot. “Shot,” here, would refer to, for example, in a basket ball game when you throw the ball up, that’s called a shot.

Bruno says, “If you don’t be quiet, I’ll show you what it  feels like to get  choked!” “To get choked” means that someone grabs you by the neck an d squeezes so that you are unable to breathe.  We can say that the p erson is “choking,” that’s usually because they eat something, for example, that gets stuck in their throat and they can’t breathe.  Or if you want to kill someone,  you may choke them: “The person was getting choked by his friend, because he wa s angry.”  Of course, that’s very dangerous; you should probably not choke anybody today! Bruno, of course, isn’t serious; he’s not actually going to choke Tamara.  We don’t approve of that on ESL Podcast!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Bruno:  Hey, what are you doing?  Give me back that remo te!

Tamara:  The movie I want to watch is on right now.  D o you mind?

Bruno:  Of course I mind!  I’m watching the playoffs.  C an’t you see that?

Tamara:  The playoffs?  Oh, I’ll watch with you.

Bruno:  You?  You don’t know anything about sports.

Tamara:  It doesn’t matter.  I always root for the und erdog.  Our team will be victorious!  Go team!

Bruno:  Fine, but I’m rooting for the other team.  Let’s just watch the game, okay?

Tamara:  Your team is going to get pounded.  We will  be the champions!
