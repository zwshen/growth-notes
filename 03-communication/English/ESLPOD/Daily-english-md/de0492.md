This episode is called “Importing and Exporting Goods.”  It’s a dialogue between Giselle and Brian that’s going to use a lot of business vocabulary related to companies that “import,” bring goods – bring things (pr oducts) into a country, and those that “export,” send those products to be sold in oth er countries.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Giselle:  Good morning, Brian.  This is Giselle calling from Intergroup in Kansas City.

Brian:  Hi, Giselle.  How are you?

Giselle:  I’m great, thanks.  Listen, the reason I’m cal ling is that I wanted to touch base with you about the new proposed regulations.  Have you had a chance to review them?

Brian:  We’ve only had time to give them a cursory look, b ut I think we have a grasp on what the changes will be.  I don’t think that most of the new regulations would apply to our class of cargo.  As long as our certifi cates of origin are in order and our shipping agents are well informed of the changes, we won’t have anything to be concerned about.  Rest assured we’ll take  care of all that.

Giselle:  That’s good to hear.  Won’t the customs procedu res be different, though?  I understand that there are changes to the regulations affecting which containers we can use and how we transport our freight.

Brian:  No, lucky for us, all we need to do is to put som e additional information on our waybills and make sure our packing lists reflect the sam e information.

 Giselle:  I’m relieved to hear that.  You’ve really pu t my mind at ease, thanks.

Brian:  Don’t mention it.  While I have you on the ph one, do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions about the latest order?

Giselle:  No, not at all.  Fire away.

[end of dialogue]

Giselle begins our dialogue by saying, “Good morning, B rian.”  She’s calling him on the phone.  “This is Giselle calling from Intergroup  in Kansas City.”  Kansas City is located in either Missouri or Kansas: there’s actua lly a Kansas City, Missouri and a Kansas City, Kansas, in the center part of t he U.S.

Brian says, “Hi, Giselle.  How are you (how are you doing )?”  Giselle says, “I’m great, thanks.  Listen, the reason I’m calling is that  I wanted to touch base with you about the new proposed regulations.”  She’s saying “l isten” as a way of transitioning – of going back to her main topic.  “The  reason I’m calling is that I wanted to touch base with you.”  “To touch base with (som eone)” means to speak with someone about something, to get their opini on or to give your opinion. It’s often an expression you hear in the business world.  S omeone says, “I need to touch base with my customer,” that means they need to connect or be in contact with them, usually speaking to them, but perhaps emailing them as well. Giselle says she needs to touch base with Brian about the n ew proposed regulations (rules or laws).  “Have you had a chance t o review them?”  “To review them,” here, probably means look at them closely, read them carefully.

Brian says, “We’ve only had time to give them a cursory look. ”  “Cursory” (cursory) here means a quick look, without reading them ve ry carefully.  He says, “I think we have a grasp on what the changes will be.”  This expression, “to have a grasp (grasp) on (something),” means to understand som ething well, to believe, in this case, that you can do what is required.  When I was younger, I didn’t have a grasp on how to talk to women, and ther efore, women didn’t talk to me!

Brian says, “I don’t think that most of the new regulat ions would apply to our class of cargo.”  “Class,” here, means kind or type or classifi cation.  “Class” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  “Cargo” (cargo) is something t hat is carried usually in a truck, a plane, or a ship so that it can be sold somewher e else.  Another word we use for “cargo” use “freight” (freight).  So when one country – one company decides to sell things that they make to another country or  another company in

 another country, they would have to send that product – se nd those things that they are selling, and when they send them they would be  “cargo.”  They would be sent in a plane, a train, an automobile, a truck, or a ship – probably not an automobile.

Giselle is asking, then, about regulations that are rela ted somehow to importing and exporting.  “To import” means to buy things from co mpanies in another country, usually to sell in your country.  “To export” is the opposite, to sell things to a company in another country so they can sell those thin gs to their customers.

Brian says, “As long as our certificates of origin are in o rder and our shipping agents are well informed of the changes, we won’t ha ve anything to be concerned about.”  Your “certificate of origin” is a docu ment that states where something was made – where a product was made.  It’s used  when something is sold and transported internationally.  So if I make, say,  a CD, a compact disc of my singing, I would, if I were going to sell it in an other country – and of course, I would want to – I would have to have a certificate of origin.  “Origin” is where something is from; a “certificate” is just a piece of pa per that gives that information.  Well, Brian is saying that as long as our  certificates of origin are in order, meaning under this condition, if this is true –  if our certificates of origin are in order, then we don’t have anything to worry about.   The expression “in order” here means correct and organized as needed – if our certi ficates are done right, done correctly.  “Order” has several different meanings in  English; take a look at our Learning Guide, once again, for some additional e xplanations.

Brian also talks about the shipping agents.  “To ship (som ething)” as a verb means to send it somewhere, to mail it or to send it by some form of transportation.  An “agent” is a person who is responsib le for doing something, someone who represents your company.  So, a “shipping agen t” is a person whose job is to make sure that products can be sent from on e country to another; someone who looks at all the regulations, for example.  Brian is saying as long as the shipping agents are “well informed,” meaning th ey know what’s going on, we won’t have anything to be concerned about.  “Rest assu red we’ll take care of all that.”  The expression “rest assured” is used to mean t hat the other person doesn’t have to worry, everything is under control.  It’s so mething that you say to someone else in order for them to have confidence in you,  for them to know that you are going to take care of this problem.

Giselle says, “That’s good to hear (I’m glad).  Won’t the customs procedures be different, though?”  “Customs” is the agency or office of a government that looks at things – “inspects” things, we would say, that come i nto a country, looking for things that are not allowed and possibly collecting taxes on certain things.

 Usually you have to talk to someone from customs and someon e from immigration when you go into a new country.  Giselle says,  “I understand that there are changes to the regulations affecting which cont ainers we can use and how we transport our freight.”  A “container” is just  something that holds something else.  A box is a container; a bottle can be a container for soda or milk, and so forth – or beer, which is just like milk, or as important!  Giselle says that she’s worried about the changes that will affect ho w they transport their freight.  “Freight,” you’ll remember, is the same as “ca rgo.”  It’s the product that you are shipping from one place to another.

Brian says, “No, lucky for us (fortunately), all we need to  do is to put some additional information on our waybills and make sure ou r packing lists reflect the same information.”  A “waybill” (waybill – one word) is a piece of paper with information about what you are sending, how much it we ighs, and how much it is worth – how much money it is worth.  A “packing list” is a  piece of paper that says what’s inside the box or the container.

Giselle then says, “I’m relieved to hear that.  You’ve pu t my mind at ease.”  “To put (someone’s) mind at ease” (ease) means to make someon e feel more comfortable, to make someone feel calmer, to make someone  feel that there is no longer anything to worry about.

Brian says, “Don’t mention it,” meaning it’s no big dea l, that’s my job.  “While I have you on the phone,” he says (since I’m talking to you a nyway), “do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions about the latest order ?”  Giselle says, “No, not at all.  Fire away.”  “Fire away” is a somewhat inform al expression used to let another person know that you are ready for his or her q uestions or you are ready to hear what that other person has to say.  It can also be used in a business context as well.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
