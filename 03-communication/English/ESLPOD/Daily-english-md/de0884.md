[start of dialog]

Susanna:  All right, then.  This meeting is over.  We’ll meet again next week for a status update.

Juan:  Hey, do you have a few minutes to talk about  tomorrow’s teleconference?

Susanna:  Sorry, I’ve got to run.  I’m late for my department’s weekly brainstorming session.  Can it wait?

Juan:  Sure, how about a lunch meeting?

Susanna:  I can’t.  I’m holding personnel meetings over lunch all this week.  It’s the only way I can fit them in.

Juan:  Okay, how about at 3:00 this afternoon?

Susanna:  Sorry, I have a standing meeting with the  directors once a month at that time.  Can you come by after the pitch meeting  at 4:30?

Juan:  I wish I could, but our department head has called an emergency meeting for this afternoon to do some damage control after the shareholder meeting debacle last week.  Well, how about a dinner meetin g?

Susanna:  Only if we can have dinner at 9:30.  I wo n’t be finished here until then.

Juan:  Do you ever get a breather?

 Susanna:  A breather?  I think I’m due for one...in  2030.

Susanna says to Juan, “All right then. This meeting  is over.” So she's ending a meeting that she is leading, she is “running,” we m ight say. Susanna says, “We’ll meet again next week for a status update.” An “upda te” (update) is news about something that has happened. You've already had som e situation going on, some event taking place, and now you want the lates t news. Usually it's information about how things have changed. A “statu s (status) update” would be news about how a project is progressing, how it's m oving toward its goal. You're giving news about some sort of business project tha t you're working on.

Juan says, “Hey, do you have a few minutes to talk about tomorrow's teleconference?” A “teleconference” is a meeting wh ere you are talking to people on the telephone, usually several people are talkin g on the telephone at the same time. That's a teleconference. Susanna says “S orry, I've got to run.” When someone says they've “got to run,” they mean they h ave to leave right now – usually leave the building or leave the area where they are.

Susanna says, “I'm late for my department's weekly brainstorming session.” A “session” (session) is another word for a meeting. It would probably be used in a business context when talking about a meeting, but also in a medical context, especially if you are going to a therapist, a psych otherapist, or a counselor. Those are often called “counseling sessions,” where  you’re meeting with the doctor. Susanna is going to her department's weekly  brain storming session.

“To brainstorm” (brainstorm) – one word – means to try to generate, think of, come up with as many ideas as you can about a certa in topic. When you brainstorm, usually one person is writing down all of the ideas, and you don't discuss the ideas when people are proposing them. You simply give your idea and everyone gives their ideas, and then at the end , you decide which are the good ideas and the bad ideas. Susanna says, “Can it  wait?” Can your questions wait, Juan? I've got a meeting to go to.

Juan says “Sure. How about a lunch meeting?” A “lun ch meeting” would of course be a meeting that you would have over the lu nchtime. You would go somewhere to eat and also talk about whatever busin ess topic it is you need to talk about. Susanna says, “I can't. I'm holding per sonnel meetings over lunch all

this week.” “Personnel” (personnel) is another word  for employees – the people who work for a company. The personnel of a company are the employees of the company. It's a little more formal, business-like w ord, but it means the same as “employees.”

Susanna says, “It's the only way I can fit them in”  – that is, having these personnel meetings over lunch is the only way she can fit them in. “To fit something in” is a phrasal verb meaning to find tim e to do something in your very busy schedule. You have many things happening today . Somebody wants to talk to you and you don't have time on your schedule, bu t you decide “to fit them in.” You say, “Okay. I can meet you for five minutes in between this meeting and that meeting.” You're fitting them in. Juan says, “Okay.  How about at three o'clock this afternoon?” Juan really  wants to have this meeting, right? Juan says “How about at three o'clock this afternoon?” Susanna says, “So rry. I have a standing meeting with the directors once a month at that time.” A “s tanding meeting” is a meeting that occurs on a regular basis. It's a scheduled me eting that you have every week or every month or maybe every year, but it's a  meeting that occurs at the same time and that is regularly scheduled.

Susanna then says, “Can you come by” – that is, can  you come to my office – “after the pitch meeting at 4:30?” A “pitch (pitch)  meeting” is a meeting where someone is trying to get their ideas approved by so meone else. Someone is proposing a project and they are presenting their p roposal, their information, to the people who will make a decision, usually to the  bosses, in this case. The verb “to pitch” means, in this case, to try to convince someone to accept or adopt your ideas. Usually, “pitches” – in this case, as a noun  – are things that you do to try to get someone to either buy something or to give y ou money for some project that you want to work on.

Juan says, “I wish I could,” meaning I wish I could  come by after the pitch meeting at 4:30, “but our department head (the lead er of our department) has called an emergency meeting for this afternoon.” An  “emergency” is some serious situation that takes place without any warn ing, without any planning. It's something that happens suddenly, often unexpectedly . So an emergency meeting would be a meeting that you weren't plannin g on having, but you need to have because there is some sort of serious situatio n you have to take care of.

Juan says this emergency meeting is to do some “dam age control after the shareholder meeting debacle last week.” The express ion “damage (damage) control” means you are trying to minimize or reduce , lessen, the negative consequences of something that has happened. You're  trying to make sure it doesn't get any worse. So, if a company, for exampl e, makes a product, makes

something and it doesn't work, and it sells it to p eople and people complain about the product, the company will try to do damage cont rol. They will say, “Okay, we made a mistake here. Let's do something so that the  mistake doesn't get any bigger or that it doesn't cause us any more problem s. Maybe we’ll give the money back to everyone who bought this product.” Th at would be a form of damage control.

Juan says his department needs to do damage control  after the “shareholder meeting debacle” last week. Your “shareholders” are  the people who own shares or stock in your company. Shares or stocks are part ial ownership in a company. “To be a shareholder” means to be someone who owns shares, owns stock in a company. So, a stockholder meeting would be a meeti ng of all the people who have stock in that company, who have a partial owne rship of the company. A “debacle” (debacle) is another word for a disaster,  something that goes wrong, very, very wrong.

Juan says, “Well, how about a dinner meeting?” How about having a meeting over dinner, at night? Susanna says, “Only if we ca n have dinner at 9:30. I won't be finished until then.” Juan says, “Do you ever ge t a breather?” – meaning, do you ever get a break from your work, Susanna? Becau se you're working too hard, Susanna, seriously. Juan says, “Do you ever g et a breather?” Susanna says, “A breather? I think I'm due for one in 2030. ”

“To be due (due) for something” means that you are expecting and deserving to have something. It's something that is, we may say,  “owed you” – something that you are supposed to get. “I'm due for a vacation.” That would mean I am expecting a vacation soon. I deserve this vacation.  I'm owed this vacation.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
