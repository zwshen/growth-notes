Let's get started.  > Nelly:  Look at that couple over there.  What they’re doing is indecent!  Sadat:  Where?  Oh, you mean those two people hugging and kissing?  That’s not indecent.  Nelly:  They’re not just hugging and kissing.  That girl is sitting on her boyfriend’s lap and they’re making out in the middle of a public place.  They need to get a room.  Sadat:  They’re just passionate, and there’s nothing wrong with that.  Don’t you remember when you were a teenager in love?  Nelly:  When I was a teenager, we behaved a lot more modestly.  We might hold hands or give each other a peck on the cheek in public.  That’s it.  Anything else we did, we did in private.     Sadat:  Oh, you’re not saying that you didn’t get cozy with your boyfriend as a teenager, you’re just saying you did it in private.    Nelly:  Right.  What I object to is having to watch other people’s public displays of affection.  It turns my stomach.    Sadat:  Don’t look now, but there’s another PDA over there.
