Problem</a>
</h1>
We want to develop an automatic spelling corrector.
The spelling corrector should detect words that are not present
in its dictionary, and replace them with the nearest one.

<p>
The distance between an input word and a dictionary word is computed taking
into account deletions, insertions and substitutions of characters: 
an inserted or deleted character is penalized with 3 points,
a character substitution is penalized with 5 points, while matches
are not penalized.

<p>
Each word can have from 1 to 9 characters. Only the lowercase characters 
from 'a' to 'z' are allowed. 


<p>
If multiple words in the dictionary have the same distance to the input
word, they should be ranked in lexicographic order and the first one
should be selected.

<p>

<h1><a NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Input</a>
</h1>
The first line in the input contains an integer <img
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="963img1.png"
 ALT="$n$">
specifying the number of words in the dictionary.
The following <img
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="963img1.png"
 ALT="$n$"> lines contain the dictionary:
one word per line. The dictionary is sorted 
in lexicographic order.

<p>
The dictionary is followed by a line containing <img
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="963img2.png"
 ALT="$m$">, the number of words 
of text.
The text consists of lines of 10 words separated by white space, except the last
one that can have less words.

<p>

<h1><a NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Output</a>
</h1>
The output consists of the corrected text:
<img
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="963img2.png"
 ALT="$m$"> words, presented in lines with 10 words, 
except the last one that can be shorter.
