[start of dialogue]

Jermaine:  How did the investor meeting go?

Teresa:  That meeting has been postponed until next  week.  One of the potential investors is out of town.

Jermaine:  In that case, can you help me with some of this work?

Teresa:  I would, but I’m busy ordering stationery right now.

Jermaine:  Stationery?  You’re ordering stationery?

Teresa:  Yes, of course.  For us to be taken seriou sly as a new company, we have to project a professional image.  Having good stationery is part of that.

Jermaine:  I’m not sure…

Teresa:  Look, we can’t go to business meetings wit hout good business cards, right?

Jermaine:  I guess so…

Teresa:  If we have any correspondence with our pot ential investors, we need letterhead and envelopes, right?

Jermaine:  I suppose…

Teresa:  Okay, so I’m ordering those things.  In the process, I’m ordering some embossed greeting cards and some promotional postca rds.  We’ll also need some notepads and…

Jermaine:  Whoa!  Aren’t you jumping the gun?

Teresa:  Why do you say that?

Jermaine:  First, we need to establish a company, a nd then we can start behaving like one.

Teresa:  That’s where you’re wrong.  If you build i t, they will come.

Jermaine:  You mean if we start behaving like a com pany, then the investors will come?

Teresa:  Precisely!

Jermaine begins our exciting dialogue by asking Ter esa, “How did the investor meeting go?”  An “investor” is someone who usually gives money to a company to help it grow or to start it.  Of course, this pe rson wants to get their money back plus additional money if the company is successful.

Teresa says, “That meeting has been postponed until  next week.”  “To postpone” means to delay, to decide to do something at a late r time.  Teresa says, “One of the potential investors is out of town.”  Jermaine says, “In that case (meaning in that situation or because that is true), can you he lp me with some of this work?” Here we go, Jermaine trying to get someone else to do his job!  Teresa says, “I would, but I’m busy ordering stationery right now.”   “I would” means if I could I would; I would do it under certain conditions, howe ver those conditions are not present because I’m busy.  If I weren’t busy then I  would help you, that’s another way of saying that – with a lot more words!

Jermaine says, “Stationery?  You’re ordering statio nery?”  “Stationery” could be paper, it could be cards, it could be envelopes, al l of which have your organization or your company’s or your personal nam e, address, phone number, other information, nowadays email and perhaps a web site.  Teresa says, “Yes, of course.  For us to be taken seriously as a new comp any, we have to project a

professional image.”  “To be taken seriously” means  to be treated by other people as important, to be considered deserving of respect.  If you want to be treated seriously, you should not go to a job inter view looking like a clown or dressed in a bikini; the employer won’t take you se riously.  However if you are a clown in a bikini, then maybe!  Teresa says that th eir new company, in order to be taken seriously, has to project a professional i mage.  “To project” means to convey.  What does “convey” mean?  It means to pres ent yourself in a particular way so people have a certain opinion about you.  Yo u could say, “She projects confidence,” meaning you get the impression – you g et the idea that she has a lot of confidence.  This word, “project,” can be us ed and pronounced differently; take a look at our Learning Guide for some addition al explanations of that word.

Teresa is projecting an image.  The “image” is the opinion; it’s the way that other people will think of you.  If you want to project a n image of a rich person, you might buy a nice car and wear nice clothing and eat  at a nice restaurant.  That might project the image of a rich person, advice to  those of you looking for a girlfriend – well, a certain kind of girlfriend any way!

Teresa says that having good stationery is part of projecting that professional image.  Jermaine says, “I’m not sure…”  Teresa inte rrupts and says, “Look (meaning pay attention), we can’t go to business me etings without good business cards, right?”  A “business card” is a small card –  a piece of paper that has your name, address, phone number, the name of your compa ny, perhaps a little picture or what we would call “logo,” symbol of you r company on it.  Jermaine agrees and says, “I guess so,” meaning okay, I gues s that’s true; I believe that’s true.  Teresa says, “If we have any correspondence with our potential investors, we need letterhead and envelopes, right?”  “Corresp ondence” is written communication, written messages that are sent and r eceived usually by mail – by paper, but nowadays, of course, more commonly by em ail; it could also be faxed. That’s correspondence: any letters or notes between  two people or two companies.  Teresa says that if they have any corre spondence with potential “investors,” people who might want to give the comp any money, we need letterhead and envelopes.  “Letterhead” (one word) is a piece of paper that has your company’s logo or symbol, the name, usually co ntact information – that is, address, phone number, email, website.  This inform ation is often on the top of the page; sometimes it’s on the left side of the pa ge.  But the page – the piece of paper is mostly blank; you use it to print a letter  out on or, in the old days, to use a typewriter to type on it.  That’s letterhead.  “E nvelopes” are, of course, the things that you put the letter in to mail it, and t he envelope will also have your company’s name on it.

Jermaine says, “I suppose,” meaning he agrees with Teresa that they need these things, but he isn’t agreeing very strongly or very  enthusiastically.  Teresa says, “Okay, so I’m ordering those things.  In the proces s (as she’s doing this or since she is doing this), I’m ordering some embossed gree ting cards and some promotional postcards.  We’ll also need some notepa ds.”  “Embossed” means that the paper, when you feel it, has a what we wou ld call raised surface.  So if you put the paper on a table and you take your fing ers and you go over the name of the company and the logo with your fingers you can feel it.  That’s embossed (embossed).  She had ordered some embossed greeting  cards.  A “greeting card” is the sort of thing that you would give some one for their birthday, perhaps for an anniversary.  It’s a little card that has a message on the front, and usually you open it up and you sign your name inside of the  card.  Greeting cards can be sent for birthdays, they could also be sent for Chr istmas or a holiday celebration.

Normally companies don’t have a lot of greeting car ds that they use, but Teresa thinks they need them.  She also ordered some promo tional postcards. “Promotional” is anything that is used to get peopl e to find out more about your company, it’s sort of like advertising.  A “postcar d” is a small piece of thick paper that usually has a photograph on one side, and then  you write on the back of the card.  When you go on vacation, when you take a tri p to a new place, you could buy a postcard with a picture of that place and sen d it back home, saying here is what you are missing for not coming with me even th ough I invited you. Something like that!

Teresa also ordered some “notepads” (notepads – one  word), which have many pieces of paper that are attached or connected to e ach other so that you take one and you remove it, and then you have a bunch of  them underneath it.  You have notepads to write on; you may have a small one  or a large one.  They’re usually the size of a regular piece of paper, but a ll the paper is connected – it’s attached so that you can keep it all in one place.  It’s different from a “notebook.” With a notebook, usually the paper is attached or c onnected at the side, on the left side, whereas a notepad usually it’s on the to p.  Also, a notebook usually has wire that goes through small holes in the papers so  that it stays there.  A notepad doesn’t have any wire or holes, it just has typical ly glue that attaches the papers to each other.

Jermaine says, “Whoa (meaning wait a minute, slow d own)!  Aren’t you jumping the gun?”  “To jump the gun” means to do something too early, to do something before it is really necessary.  The expression come s from racing, when you have men or women running in a race – in a competition.  Usually the beginning of the race starts with a gun being shot – not a gun with bullets – and that indicates that

the runners can start to run.  If you start running  before the gun is fired, we say you have jumped the gun; you’ve gone too early.

Teresa says, “Why do you say that (why do you say t hat I have jumped the gun)?”  Jermaine says, “First, we need to establish  a company, and then we can start behaving like one.”  Jermaine is saying we do n’t even have our company started, and you are worrying about things like sta tionery.  Teresa says, “There’s where you’re wrong,” meaning you are wrong about th at thing.  She says, “If you build it, they will come.”  This expression, which originally I think was from the movie Field of Dreams  about baseball with Kevin Costner, means that if y ou build something – if you construct something people will come.  You don’t have to worry that people won’t be interested if you, for e xample, start a company people will come and buy your product.  Of course, this is n’t really true, and many companies think that people will come and buy their  product, and they waste a lot of money on things like stationery before they real ly have any customers.  It’s a very common problem with small businesses.

Jermaine says, “You mean if we start behaving like a company, then the investors will come?” meaning we’ll get people to g ive us money to start and continue our company.  Teresa says, “Precisely!” me aning exactly, correct. When you agree with everything the person has said you would say “precisely.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
