<h2>Problem D: Convex Hull</h2>

<img src="p11626.png" align=right>

Finding the convex hull of a set of points is an important problem that
is often part of a larger problem. There are many algorithms for finding
the convex hull. Since problems involving the convex hull sometimes
appear in the ACM World Finals, it is a good idea for contestants to
know some of these algorithms.
<p>
Finding the convex hull of a set of points in the plane can be divided
into two sub-tasks. First, given a set of points, find a subset of those
points that, when joined with line segments, form a convex polygon that
encloses all of the original points. Second, output the points of the
convex hull in order, walking counter-clockwise around the polygon.
In this problem, the first sub-task has already been done for you,
and your program should complete the second sub-task. That is,
given the points that are known to lie on the convex hull, output
them in order walking counter-clockwise around the hull.

<h3>Input Specification</h3>
The first line of input contains a single integer, the number of test cases to follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer 
3 &lt;= <i>n</i> &lt;= 100000,
the number of points. The following <i>n</i> lines of the test case each
describe a point. Each of these lines contains two integers and either
a <tt>Y</tt> or an <tt>N</tt>, separated by spaces. The two integers
specify the x- and y-coordinates of the point. A <tt>Y</tt> indicates
that the point is on the convex hull of all the points, and a <tt>N</tt>
indicates that it is not. The x- and y-coordinates of each point will be
no less than -1000000000 and no greater than 1000000000.
No point will appear more than once in
the same test case. The points in a test case will never all lie on
a line.

<h3>Output Specification</h3>
For each test case, generate the following output.
First, output a line containing a single integer <i>m</i>, the number of
points on the convex hull. Next output <i>m</i> lines, each describing
a point on the convex hull, in counter-clockwise order around the hull.
Each of these lines should contain the x-coordinate of the point,
followed by a space, followed by the y-coordinate of the point.
Start with the point on the hull whose x-coordinate is minimal.
If there are multiple such points, start with the one whose y-coordinate
is minimal.
