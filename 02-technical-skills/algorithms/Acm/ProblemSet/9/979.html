<!--SEC END -->You discovered the Magic Gold Triangle, which has the
power to give
fortune and wisdom to his owner, during an archaeological excavation
in the tomb of the Egyptian emperor Triangles III. However, the
Abominable Triangleman has followed your footsteps, stole the Triangle
and hid it in the Plane World of the Visible Points. You know that,
to disguise the Triangle, the Abominable Triangleman made some
operations over it, but you don't know the complete details. You know
that the Magic Triangle may have been subject to an arbitrary rotation,
may have been subject an arbitrary translation (both in the 2D
plane) and may been subject to a reflection on a mirror, but its
dimensions were kept unchanged. You also know that its
sides became transparent and the only parts you can see from the
Triangle are its vertices. However, there are so many points in the
Plane World of the Visible Points! If you could guess which of them
are the vertices of the Magic Gold Triangle, you could get it back...<BR><BR>

You know the coordinates of the vertices A, B and C of the Magic Gold
Triangle when it was in your possession (example in Figure 1). You
also know the coordinates of all the points currently in the Plane
World of the Visible Points, which include the vertices of the stolen
Triangle (example in figure 2). Your task is to make a program that
may discover the Triangle, i. e., to find out which of the points in
the Plane are the vertices of the hidden triangle.
<!--TOC subsection Input-->
<h3 class="subsection">Input</h3>
<b>
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.
Consecutive test cases are separated by a single blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>
<!--SEC END -->The input of your program will be a sequence of text
lines. The first
three lines will contain the original coordinates of the Triangle,
before being stolen. The next line will contain an integer N in the
interval [4..2000] representing the number of points in Plane World,
and the next N lines the coordinates of those points. Coordinates will
be represented by two integer numbers, the x-coordinate and the
y-coordinate, separated by a space.
<!--TOC subsection Output-->
<h3 class="subsection">Output</h3>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>
<!--SEC END -->The output will be a sequence of three lines with the
coordinates of
the points in the Plane World of the Visible Points corresponding to
the vertices of the Magic Gold Triangle.
