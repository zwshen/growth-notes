# Buying Computer Accessories

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 05: Buying Computer Accessories. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 405.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

If you go to our website at eslpod.com you can download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definit ions, sample sentences using the vocabulary, additional definitions not discussed  on the episode, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and, if that weren’t eno ugh, a complete transcript of this episode. 

This episode is called “Buying Computer Accessories.”  An “acce ssory” is something you buy that works with something else; it’s some thing that helps you or improves on another product.  This is going to be a d ialogue between Kevin and Ginger about buying things for your computer, so we’ ll have lots of vocabulary related to the computer.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Ginger:  It’s really nice of you to come with me to buy m y computer.  This is the desktop I’m thinking about. 

Kevin:  This is okay, but if I were you, I’d buy a laptop.   It’s more versatile.  You can travel with it. 

Ginger:  I’m not sure about getting a laptop.  The screen is so small. 

Kevin:  No problem.  You can get a separate monitor.  This is a good one.  You just need a connector and a cable to hook it up to your l aptop.  Here’s a monitor stand, too, so you can elevate it if you want to. 

Ginger: The speakers on the laptop aren’t very loud. 

Kevin:  You can get these great speakers.  You plug them into your laptop and the sound is amazing.   

Ginger:  I’m not sure about the battery. 

 Kevin:  It comes with a battery that lasts three to five h ours, but you can always buy a spare.  Of course, it comes with a power cord, too , so you can just plug it in if your battery runs low. 

Ginger:  The keyboard is a little cramped, too. 

Kevin:  That’s what a full-size keyboard is for.  You can buy a separate keyboard and mouse and attach them to your laptop.  It’ll be j ust like having a desktop. 

Ginger:  Then why don’t I just buy a desktop?   

Kevin:  If you do, you won’t be able to buy all of the se great accessories.  That’s half the fun of buying a new computer!

Our dialogue begins with Ginger saying, “It’s really nice  of you to come with me to buy my computer.  This is the desktop I’m thinking abou t.”  Ginger says, “This is the desktop.”  The “desktop,” here, refers to the deskto p computer, which is a computer that has a large machine and usually a separate “monitor,” the thing that you use to see what’s on your computer; it has a scre en that you look at.  A “desktop,” then, is a machine – a computer that is separat e, usually, from the monitor. 

Kevin says, “This is okay (this desktop is okay), but if I were you, I’d buy a laptop.”  A “laptop” (laptop) is sometimes called a “n otebook” computer; it’s a small computer that you can fold up and put in a bag o r in a backpack.  Kevin says the laptop is “more versatile.”  “Versatile” (versati le) is something that has many different uses, something that can be used in diff erent ways.  You could say, “That person is versatile, she can do different things for her company.” 

Kevin says you can travel with a laptop computer.  Ginger sa ys, “I’m not sure about getting a laptop.”  She’s says, “The screen is so smal l.”  The “screen” is the part of the computer monitor that you look at, as we me ntioned before.  Kevin says, “No problem.  You can get a separate monitor” – you  can get a separate piece of equipment that you can put on your desk that h as the screen on it.  “This is a good one,” Kevin says, “You just need a connector a nd a cable to hook it up to your laptop.”  A “connector” is something that helps yo u put one piece of electronic equipment together with something else.  A co nnector usually has holes in it, on one or both ends, and it plugs into som e electronic device.  A “cable” is the long piece of wire, usually covered in plast ic that connects two pieces of electronic equipment.  So, a cable will typical ly have a connector on  

 both ends, one for one piece of equipment, the other  for the other piece of equipment.  To “hook something up” means to connect two things together, usually electronic things: “I hooked up my DVD player to my television” – I connected it so I could watch a DVD movie. 

Kevin says, “Here’s a monitor stand, too, so you can elevate  it if you want to.”  To “elevate” means to raise, to make something higher, to m ove something up.  If you go into a large building, they’ll typically have somet hing called “elevators,” which is a noun, comes from the verb to “elevate,” means to go up, it takes you up into the building.  It’s a small box that “elevates, ” or goes up.  Kevin says that the monitor stand will elevate the computer monitor.  The “monitor stand” is a piece of plastic or metal that you can put a monitor on top of, so it’s a little higher up off your desk.  That’s a “monitor stand.” 

Ginger says, “The speakers on the laptop aren’t very loud. ”  “Speakers” are parts of a radio or a computer or a television that we use to  listen to music, to people talking, to this podcast perhaps; you may have speakers.  Usua lly a speaker is something that more than one person can hear.  If it’s just one person putting it into their ears, those things are called “earbuds” or “h eadphones.”  But, a speaker is something that is meant for many different peo ple to hear. 

So, Ginger is complaining that the speakers are too “sof t,” they’re not loud enough.  Kevin says, “You can get these great speakers.  Yo u plug them into your laptop and the sound is amazing.”  To “plug somethi ng into something else” is to connect a piece of electronic equipment to another piece of electronic equipment, or to some source of electricity.  For exampl e, if you have a computer you will plug it into the wall; you will get electricit y from your wall – from your electrical system in your house.  So, you can plug something  in to get electricity – to get power, or you can plug something in as a way of connecting two pieces of equipment.  Kevin is suggesting that Ginger can buy thes e speakers, and then plug them into her computer so she can have better sound .  She doesn’t have to use the speakers that are “built-in” to the laptop, tha t are part of the laptop frame – the laptop container or case, we would say. 

Ginger says, “I’m not sure about the battery” (on the la ptop).  The “battery” is what stores electricity; it “stores,” or keeps, power so you c an use something without having to plug it into the wall for electricit y.  Your cell phone has a battery; most laptop computers have a battery. 

Kevin says the laptop “comes with a battery (meaning it is sold with a battery) that lasts (that will be good for) three to five hours (of use), but you can always buy a spare.”  A “spare” (spare) is an extra copy of somet hing – an extra piece of  

 something, usually in case something that you have breaks an d you need another one right away.  For example in your car, if you  have a car, you may have a spare tire.  The “tire” is the part of the car t hat goes around the wheels and allows you to drive on a street.  A “spare tire” is a n extra tire; in case you have one tire that doesn’t work properly you can put on  the extra – the spare tire. So, you can have a spare battery for your laptop as well.   He says, “Of course, (the laptop) comes with a power cord, too, so you can just  plug it in if your battery runs low.”  A “power cord” is a long cable that connects yo ur piece of electronics to the source of electricity in the wall.  So, you “plug  in” the power cord; it’s a cable that connects something to a wall where you have e lectricity. 

Ginger then says, “The keyboard is a little cramped, too.”   The “keyboard” is the part of the computer that you type on, that has lette rs and numbers that you can hit.  We call those “keys.”  To say something is “cramped” me ans it is very close together, too close together.  You might say it’s “crowd ed.”  You might walk into a room and say, “It’s cramped in here.  It’s so small; ther e are too many people here.”  That is to be “cramped.”  Ginger says the keyboard  is cramped; it’s too small.  Kevin says you can buy a “full-sized,” a bigger, keybo ard and a mouse and attach them to your computer.   

Ginger says, “Then why don’t I just buy a desktop?”  Kevin says, “If you do, you won’t be able to buy all these great accessories.  That’s half the fun of buying a new computer!”  When we say something is “half the fun, ” we mean that’s part of the excitement – that’s part of the fun of doing someth ing.  Kevin is suggesting that buying all these extra things is part of the fun of  buying a computer. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
