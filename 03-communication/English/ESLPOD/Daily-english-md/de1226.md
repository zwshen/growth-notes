This episode is a dialogue between Naomi and Omar a bout describing sounds that are made by humans and non-humans. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Naomi: Stop! Stop!

Omar: What’s the matter?

Naomi: My bike is making a strange sound.

Omar: What kind of sound?

Naomi: It’s a clanging sound followed by a hissing or buzzing noise. I need to pinpoint where it’s coming from.

Omar: Walk your bike and we’ll both listen, you on one side and me on the other.

Naomi: Okay, here goes. Hear that?

Omar: Yeah, but it’s more of a popping or pinging s ound.

Naomi: It sounded different when I was riding it. I ’ll get on and you run alongside. What do you hear?

Omar: I hear the whirring of the pedals and the cre aking and rattling of the chain, but no clanging sound.

Naomi: I’ll speed up. What do you hear now?

 Omar: Nothing, just the rustling of my own clothes.

Naomi: The sound gets louder as I speed up. I’ll go  faster. Now what do you hear?

Omar: Just my own panting and . . . my . . . last g asp . . .

Naomi shouts at Omar, “Stop! Stop!” Omar says, “Wha t’s the matter?” meaning “What is wrong?” Naomi says, “My bike is making a s trange sound.” A “bike” (bike) is a bicycle, something with two wheels and a seat, that you move by moving your legs up and down in a circle. Naomi say s her bike is “making a strange sound,” a strange noise. Omar says, “What k ind of sound?”

Naomi says, “It’s a clanging sound followed by a hi ssing or buzzing noise. I need to pinpoint where it’s coming from.” A “clanging (c langing) sound” comes when you have two pieces of metal that are hitting each other, such as two pans in your kitchen, something like this [clanging]. That’ s a “clanging” sound. “Clanging” comes from the verb “to clang” (clang).

Naomi says the clanging sound made by her bike is f ollowed by a “hissing” sound, or a “hissing noise.” “To hiss” (hiss) means  to make a sound similar to what I guess a snake would make. In fact, we often describe the sound made by a snake as being a “hissing sound.” It sounds a bit  like [hisses] – a bit like that. Naomi says her bike, which seems to be an amazing s ound machine, also makes a “buzzing noise.” “To buzz” (buzz) is to mak e a sound like a bee – something like this [buzzes].

Naomi says that she needs “to pinpoint where it’s c oming from.” “To pinpoint” (pinpoint) is to identify or find the exact place o r location of something. Naomi wants “to pinpoint” where this noise is coming from . Omar says, “Walk your bike and we’ll both listen, you on one side and me on the other.” Omar is telling Naomi to get off of her bike and walk with the bike  in her hands so that she can listen on one side of the bike and Omar can listen on the other side of the bike.

Naomi says, “Okay, here goes.” That expression “her e goes” is used immediately before you try to do something, especially if you’r e not sure if what you are going to do will be successful. For example, you may say to someone, “I’m going to sing you a song. I’m not a very good singer but, we ll, here goes,” meaning I’m

now going to do it. I’m now going to, in this case,  sing, even though I may not sing very well. I should probably say that every ti me before I try singing.

Naomi then says to Omar, “Hear that?” meaning “Do y ou hear that sound, that noise?” By the way, I’ve been using both the word “ sound” and “noise” in this explanation. A “noise” is usually a sound that isn’ t pleasant, that you don’t want to hear. If someone describes your singing as “nois e,” as my singing has often been described, well, that means the person doesn’t  like your singing very much. In any case, in our dialogue, Omar is trying to hea r the noise that Naomi hears.

He says, “Yeah” – meaning yes, I hear that noise – “but it’s more of a popping or pinging sound.” Omar thinks that the sound the bike  is making is more of a “popping” sound. “Popping” comes from the verb “to pop” (pop) which is to make a loud, short sound that is made, for example, if y ou have a balloon and then suddenly the balloon breaks. The verb we would use in that case would be “pop.” “The balloon pops.” It sounds something like this [ popping sound].

Did I scare you there? Were you drinking your coffe e and suddenly I made you spill it? Sorry about that. Oops, there I go again.  That’s a popping sound. “To ping” (ping) is to make a higher pitched sound. It is made by two things hitting against each other. It sounds something like this [ pinging sound]. We would describe that as a “pinging” sound, I think.

Naomi says, “It sounded different when I was riding  it,” meaning the bike was making a different sound when Naomi was actually on  the bike, riding it, rather than walking it as she was just now. She says, “I’l l get on” – meaning I will get on the bicycle – “and you run alongside. What do you h ear?” “To run alongside” (alongside) means to run next to something or someo ne. Omar says, “I hear the whirring of the pedals and the creaking and rattlin g of the chain, but no clanging sound.”

Omar says he hears some sounds as Naomi is riding the bicycle, but they are different sounds. One of the sounds is coming from the “pedals” (pedals). The “pedals” of a bicycle are those two things you put your feet on in order to move the bicycle, in order to make the bicycle go forwar d. Your foot goes on the pedal. The “chain” (chain) of a bicycle connects the littl e wheel that you are spinning when you are moving the pedals up and down and the wheel in back of the bicycle – that round metal loop is called a “chain. ”

The pedals, according to Omar, are making a “whirri ng” sound. “Whirring” (whirring) is a sound made by objects that are movi ng very quickly through the air. Another whirring sound would be made by a heli copter, for example [whirring

sound]. Of course, a pedal doesn’t make a sound tha t loud. That’s a helicopter making a whirring sound. Omar describes the sound that the chain is making as a “creaking and rattling sound.”

We usually use the verb “to creak” when we are desc ribing a piece of wood that you are walking on and is making a sound. An old fl oor made of wood, for example, would probably creak. I’m not sure if a bi cycle chain would creak, but I guess it’s possible that something made of metal th at is put under a lot of pressure might also creak, making a high-pitched so und again. Here’s wood “creaking” [creaking sound].

Interestingly enough, there’s another word we used to describe noise which is “squeaking” (squeaking). “Squeaking” sounds like “c reaking” except it has a much higher pitch. The sound is a lot higher. Here would be an example of a door squeaking [squeaking sound]. So “creaking” is like “squeaking,” except it’s a lower sound.

“Rattling” is a noise that is made when two things are hitting each other. They could be made of metal or some other material. If y ou have a set of keys in your pocket, they could be “rattling” together, or a bun ch of coins could “rattle” as they hit each other and made noise. Here would be an exa mple of something “rattling” (rattling) – [rattling sound]. That’s a chain rattl ing. So, Omar doesn’t hear the “clanging sound” that Naomi heard. Naomi says, “I’l l speed up.” “To speed up” means to go faster, to increase your speed. Remembe r, Naomi is riding on her bicycle.

“What do you hear now?” Naomi asks. Omar says, “Not hing, just the rustling of my own clothes.” A “rustling” (rustling) sound is w hat we would describe as a gentle sound made by a soft object that is rubbing against another soft object. You can think of the leaves in a tree as rustling a gainst each other as the wind blows through the trees. Here would be an example of a rustling sound, although it sounds like the wind is blowing rather strong in  this example. Let’s listen [rustling sound]. That might be paper rustling in that example.

Omar says the only thing he hears is the rustling of his own clothes. He’s running so fast that he hears the wind against his own clot hing. Naomi says, “The sound gets louder as I speed up. I’ll go faster.” Remembe r, Naomi is riding the bicycle and Omar is running next to her. She then says, “No w what do you hear?” Omar says, “Just my own panting and . . . my . . . last gasp . . .”

Omar is too tired to continue running. He says the only thing he hears is his own “panting.” “To pant” (pant) is something that a hum an or other animal does when

it breathes very quickly. You can hear the sound co ming from your mouth because you are very tired. If you run suddenly, or  walk up a lot of stairs, you might pant. Because you are so tired, you have prob lems breathing.

Omar is panting and the only thing he can hear is the panting and his “last gasp.” Your “last gasp” (gasp) is the last thing you do be fore you die. It’s your dying breath. Sometimes you will hear on a TV show or mov ie someone who is just about to die, and the last thing you hear is their “last gasp” and then they die. Well, I didn’t die. I just finished our explanation .

And now we’ll listen to the dialogue one more time.
