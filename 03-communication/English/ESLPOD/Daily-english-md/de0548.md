This episode is called “Working for an Impossible Boss.”  Th e word “impossible” (not possible) here means a boss who is very difficult to w ork for, somebody who is so difficult we may say that it is almost impossible to w ork for this person.  It’s a dialogue between Mr. Mann and Laura, and uses some v ocabulary that you might find when you are having an argument with your b oss.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Mr. Mann:  Why are all these people milling around do ing no work?  Laura! You’re in charge when I’m out of the office and you’re  incompetent! 

Laura:  Mr. Mann, we need to talk in private.  Let’s g o into your office. 

Mr. Mann:  What is this about? 

Laura:  Mr. Mann, I’ve tried to do my job the best I ca n, but I won’t tolerate your verbal abuse any longer.   

Mr. Mann:  Verbal abuse?!  I’m just telling it like it is.  It’s my…it’s my…management style.  This is business.  If you can’t take th e heat, get out of the kitchen. 

Laura:  If I thought this was about my performance, I w ould certainly take any constructive criticism, but this is really about your inappr opriate behavior. 

 Mr. Mann:  What inappropriate behavior?  You’re quest ioning my behavior? 

Laura:  Yes, I’ve held my tongue long enough.  Every day,  you come back to the office tipsy from a three-martini lunch, and you go off on me in front of the other employees.  That undermines my authority and puts me in a n impossible position. 

Mr. Mann:  I’m your boss and you have no right to questi on the way I run this house…I mean, department. 

Laura:  With all due respect, this is no way to run a de partment. 

Mr. Mann:  And how dare you suggest that I’m drunk?  Yo u don’t know who you’re dealing with. 

Laura:  Oh, yes I do.  You’re my ex-boss.  I’ve had enoug h.  I quit! 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Mr. Mann asking Laura, “Why ar e all these people milling around doing no work?”  “To mill (mill) arou nd” is a phrasal verb meaning to be in an area without doing anything productive or without having a purpose; we would also say “to hang around.”  A more technical te rm would be “to loiter” (loiter).  Sometimes you’ll see signs outside of stores tha t say “No loitering,” that means you can’t just stand there and look around, you have to have some purpose while you’re there.  Usually it means you just can’ t stand there – you can’t be there.  In an office, if people are loiterin g – if people are milling around, well, they’re not really doing anything; they should be working, in this case.  So Mr. Mann says, “Laura!  You’re in charge when I’m out o f the office and you’re incompetent!”  “To be in charge” means to have the resp onsibility for something, to have power over a project or other people.  Usually, it’s the power to tell them what to do – have the authority to tell them what to do.  So when Mr. Mann is not in the office, Laura becomes the boss.  By the way, the wo rd “charge” has several different meanings in English; you can find those meanings in the Learning Guide for today on our website. 

Mr. Mann says that Laura is incompetent.  “To be compete nt” means to be capable, to be able to do something.  “To be incompete nt” means to be not competent, incapable, unable to do something often bec ause you don’t have  

 enough experience or perhaps because you’re not very smar t, at least that’s what Mr. Mann seems to think. 

Laura says, “Mr. Mann, we need to talk in private (mea ning with nobody else around).  Let’s go into your office.”  Mr. Mann says, “Wh at is this about?”  Laura then replies, “Mr. Mann, I’ve tried to do my job the b est I can, but I won’t tolerate your verbal abuse any longer.”  “Verbal” refers to some thing that is spoken, something that someone says.  “Abuse” is when someone is hur ting another person, either physically or psychologically.  So, “verbal abu se” would be someone who is yelling at you, calling you names, perhaps sw earing, saying bad things about you that are way more than what they should  be saying to you.  This is what is happening to Laura, so she says she won’t “toler ate,” she won’t put up with, his verbal abuse. 

Mr. Mann says, “Verbal abuse?!”  He’s surprised and shocked,  maybe a little angry.  “I’m just telling it like it is,” meaning I am just describing the truth, the real situation here.  “It’s my…it’s my… management style,” he says.  “Management” has to do with the way that you work with other people,  usually as a boss.  You manage them – you control them.  “Style” is the way that  you do something, so your “management style” is the way that you work with oth er people, especially when you’re the boss.  So Mr. Mann is a little angry her e; he says, “This is business.  If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kit chen.”  This is an old expression: “If you can’t take (meaning if you can’t toler ate – if you can’t put up with) the heat, you should get out of (you should leave ) the kitchen.”  A “kitchen,” of course, is where you prepare food, and it’s often hot  in a kitchen.  So, if you can’t put up with the heat – if you can’t tolerate the  heat, then you shouldn’t be in the kitchen.  The idea is that you should not be in a p lace or a situation unless you can handle the pressure and stress.  If you are in a d ifficult situation and you cannot handle it, well then, you should leave it.  It’s often said to people who complain about their situation because it is stressful or i t is difficult.  The popular belief in the United States is that this expression was “co ined,” that is this expression was invented by a U.S. President, President Har ry Truman, who was president after Franklin Roosevelt, up until January of 1953. 

So, Mr. Mann is saying that Laura has to listen to him e ven if he yells at her. Laura says, “If I thought this was about my performance, I would certainly take any constructive criticism, but this is really about your inapp ropriate behavior.” She’s saying that this is not about her “performance,” wh at she does.  If it were about that, she would “take any constructive criticism,” she  would accept any advice about how she can improve.  That’s what constructive criticism is.   

 “Criticism” is when you tell someone they’re doing somethi ng wrong; “constructive criticism” is when you are telling them thing s they are doing wrong in order that they can improve – so that they can get b etter.  That’s the idea.  But Laura thinks that Mr. Mann’s “behavior,” the way he is ta lking to her, is “inappropriate.”  This is a common word now you hear; p eople say, “That’s inappropriate,” they mean it isn’t something that you should be doing or saying either because it’s rude or because it doesn’t belong in  that particular situation or environment.  So if you work at a business office, and you come in one day with your shorts on and a baseball cap (a baseball hat) and a T-shirt, and everyone else is wearing suits and ties and dresses, someone might say to you, “Your dress today is inappropriate.”  It’s not right for this si tuation, and that’s what Laura is saying to Mr. Mann. 

Well, Mr. Mann…he’s, uh, not very interested in hearing Laura’s opinion.  He says, “What inappropriate behavior?  You’re questioning my behavior?” meaning you’re asking questions; you’re doubting the way I do thin gs; you’re criticizing me.  Laura says, “Yes, I’ve held my tongue long enough.”  “To hold your tongue” means to not say something even though you want to, to s tay quiet even when you really want to say something.  Laura says that she has held her tongue long enough, “Every day, you come back to the office tipsy from a  three-martini lunch.”  “To be tipsy” (tipsy) means to be a little bit d runk, to have had an alcoholic drink.  It makes you a little silly or a little stupid.  It’s not completely drunk, but it is a little bit drunk, if you will.  “Mar tini” is a type of drink.  There’s an old expression: “the three-martini lunch,” meaning inste ad of going to lunch and eating food, especially if you’re a business executive or m anager, you spend your time drinking instead.  “The three-martini lunch” represents someone wasting their time; doing things, because they are the boss, that they shouldn’t be doing.  “The three-martini lunch” expression is not as common anymore.  In part, that’s because it used to be many years ago that b usinesses could include the cost of business lunches as a business expense.  However, in  the recent years the government has changed the regulations so that n ow you can only count half of that lunch as being a business expense, so the  three-martini lunch is not as popular. 

Laura says to Mr. Mann, “you go off on me in front of  the other employees.”  “To go off on (someone)” means to lose your temper and pati ence, to criticize someone else, to shout or yell at them, especially if you are really angry about something.  Notice the expression is “to go off on (someon e).”  You can say, “he went off” or “don’t go off” without the “on” if you mean don’t get angry, don’t start yelling.  If you want to talk about who someone is yellin g at, who someone is  

 angry with, then you would say, “He’s going off on Laura ,” or whomever.  Laura says that when Mr. Mann goes off on her in front of oth er employees that that undermines her authority.  “To undermine (someone’s) au thority” means to decrease the amount of power that someone has, to weake n their ability to be respected by other people.  So you’d undermine someone’s authority by doing things that would make other people not respect them, not listen to them.   

Mr. Mann says, “I’m your boss and you have no right to quest ion (to criticize) the way I run this house.”  “Run,” here, means to manage.  “…I mean,” Mr. Mann says, “department.”  Of course, Mr. Mann suddenly thinks tha t he’s at home, perhaps arguing with one of his children.  Laura says, “ With all due respect, this is no way to run a department.”  “With all due respect”  is a polite phrase that you use when you disagree with someone and you want to give your opinion without making them angry.  So Laura says, “With all due respect,  this is no way to run a department.” 

Mr. Mann is still angry; he says, “And how dare you suggest that I’m drunk?” “How dare you?” is a phrase used when you are very angry and shocked by what someone has said, usually because they have criticized you: “Ho w dare you come into my house and yell at me?  Get out of my hous e!  How dare you?”  Mr. Mann then says, “You don’t know who you’re dealing with .”  This expression, “you don’t know who you’re dealing with,” is used when you’re very angry and you want to emphasize to the other person that you are ve ry powerful, very important, too powerful and important to be treated  the way you are being treated. 

Laura says, “Oh, yes I do.  You’re my ex-boss.”  “Ex,” here , means former, used to.  I can say, “Angelina Jolie is my ex-girlfriend” or “ Halle Berry is my ex- girlfriend.”  I could say that – it’s not true, but I co uld say that!  That would be an example of “ex,” former, used to, not anymore.  Laura i s really saying here that she’s quitting.  She says, “I’ve had enough (meaning I can not stand or tolerate your behavior anymore).  I quit!”  And she leaves the off ice and she goes back to school to study biology or she gets another job – you can in vent the end of the story! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
