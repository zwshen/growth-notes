# Questioning Mental Competency

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,209 – Questioning Mental Competency.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,209. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. Take a look at our  ESL Podcast courses in Business and Daily English, and I think you’ll enjo y them.

This episode is about people like me, who sometimes  can be a little crazy. We’re talking about whether someone is mentally competent  – whether they can think and behave rationally and logically. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Claire: What are you doing with all those law books ? I thought you retired 20 years ago.

Ray: I’m preparing for my mental competency hearing .

Claire: Mental competency hearing? But your mind is  as sharp as it has ever been.

Ray: That’s not what my children think. They are go ing to court to prove my diminished capacity. They are going to argue that I  need a conservator for my estate.

Claire: Nobody who knows you would question your so und mind. There must be another reason for this hearing.

Ray: You’re right. My children want to get their ha nds on my money, and if they can prove mental incapacitation and impaired judgme nt, they will get power of attorney.

Claire: And if they get power of attorney . . .

Ray: They would get control of my company and my en tire estate.

Claire: So what are you going to do?

 Ray: I am going to fight fire with fire. I’m suing them.

Claire: What for?

Ray: Fraud, and I can make it stick. They’re both l acking in common sense. Everybody knows you should never sue an attorney, e specially a successful one!

Claire begins our dialogue by asking Ray, “What are  you doing with all those law books? I thought you retired 20 years ago.” “To ret ire” means to leave your job, usually when you are older – say, 65 years or more.  Ray says, “I’m preparing for my mental competency hearing.” “Mental” (mental) re fers to your mind, to your ability to use your brain. “Competency” (competency ) refers to the ability to do something. A “hearing” (hearing) is an opportunity,  often in front of a judge in a courtroom, to make your case – to give the judge in formation so that the judge can make a decision.

Put it all together and we have “mental competency hearing,” which is a legal hearing – a legal meeting, if you will – in front of a judge, in which the judge is going to decide if a certain person has lost his ab ility to think rationally or clearly. If someone is “not mentally competent,” then differ ent rules apply, different laws apply to that person. For example, if you are not m entally competent, you may not be able to control your own money or even your own medical decisions. Ray says he’s preparing for his mental competency heari ng.

Claire is surprised at this. She says, “Mental comp etency hearing? But your mind is as sharp as it has ever been.” If you say someon e’s mind is “sharp” (sharp), or describe someone as “being sharp,” you mean the per son is able to think clearly and intelligently. The adjective can also mean to b e bright or intelligent or smart. Ray says, “That’s not what my children think.” In o ther words, Ray’s children think that he is no longer mentally competent, that  he cannot take care of himself.

“They are going to court” – that is, his children a re going to a judge – “to prove my diminished capacity.” “Diminished (diminished) c apacity (capacity)” is when you no longer have the ability to think as clearly as you did, so much so that you probably shouldn’t be handling your own affairs – t aking care of your business or personal affairs yourself. Ray says that his childr en “are going to argue” – they’re going to tell the judge – that he needs a “conserva tor for my estate.”

A “conservator” (conservator) is someone who takes care of another person’s legal and financial matters, especially when that p erson is no longer able to do it himself. So, if you are judged to be “mentally inco mpetent” – that is, not able to take care of your own affairs, your own financial a nd legal matters – the judge, the government in effect, will give someone that po wer, and that person is called a “conservator.” Your “estate” (estate) here refers  to all of the money and things that you own.

Claire says, “Nobody who knows you would question,”  would doubt, “your sound mind.” “To have a sound (sound) mind” is to be ment ally competent. We have an expression “to be of sound mind” – that is, you are  logical, rational. You are able to think clearly. If you are going to sign a contra ct or enter into a legal agreement, you must be “of sound mind.” If you are not, then t he agreement is invalid. That is, you can’t enter into a legal contract if you are not mentally competent. Even though a lot of people enter into legal contracts t hat are pretty stupid, that isn’t quite the same thing.

Claire says, “There must be another reason for this  hearing.” Ray says, “You’re right. My children want to get their hands on my mo ney.” The expression “to get your hands (hands) on” something means you want to get control of something. “To get your hands on someone’s money” means to tak e someone’s money or get control of someone’s money.

A beautiful young woman who marries a rich old man maybe trying to get her hands on his money, or it could just be love. Yes, that’s it. It’s love. The same would be true, of course, of a young man and a rich  old woman. But let’s not talk about people here in Hollywood. Back to our story. Ray says that his children want to get their hands on his money. He says, “If they can prove mental incapacitation and impaired judgment, they will get  power of attorney.”

There are a couple of legal phrases or expressions here. The first one is “mental incapacitation.” We’ve already talked about “dimini shed capacity.” “Mental incapacitation” is when you are judged not to be ab le to think clearly. “To be incapable of” doing something is to be unable to do  something. So if you are “incapacitated,” you are unable to do a certain thi ng. You could be “physically incapacitated” – that is, unable to move your body of your own volition, of your own will – or you could be “mentally incapacitated. ”

If you are mentally incapacitated, it’s basically t he same as being “mentally incompetent.” You are unable to do what you need to  do. “To have impaired (impaired) judgment” means to be unable to make goo d, logical decisions. If you drink a lot of alcohol, for example, you may have “ impaired judgment.” People

who go to a bar on Friday night and drink a lot of alcohol, by the end of the night often have impaired judgment and tend to believe th at other people in the bar are more attractive than they really are.

Ray says that his children want to get “power of at torney” (attorney). The word “attorney” normally refers to a lawyer. The express ion “power of attorney,” however, refers to the legal authority that one per son has to represent another person in some sort of financial or legal decision or contract. If you have “power of attorney” for your parents, for example, you are  able to do everything your parents would be able to do financially and legally  in most cases. So you could go to a bank and open up a bank account in their na me if you have power of attorney.

Sometimes power of attorney gives you the right to make medical decisions for another person if the government decides that that person is mentally incapacitated. However, you can voluntarily give so meone power of attorney. My accountant has power of attorney before the governm ent to represent me on tax matters. You may give power of attorney to your hus band or wife in case you are unable to do something because you are mentally or physically incapacitated.

Claire says, “If they,” meaning Ray’s children, “ge t power of attorney . . .” Ray interrupts and says, “They would get control of my company and my entire estate.” Claire asks, “So what are you going to do? ” Ray responds, “I am going to fight fire with fire.” The expression “to fight fir e (fire) with fire” means to attack someone using the same methods or techniques that p erson is using to attack you. Ray says, “I’m suing them.” “To sue” (sue) som eone means to bring a legal case against someone in front of a judge.

Claire says, “What for?” meaning what are you suing  them for? Ray says, “Fraud, and I can make it stick.” “Fraud” (fraud) are lies or actions that are meant to trick another person, to fool another person, in order to  get this other person to give you his money. The expression “to make it stick” (s tick) means to demonstrate that it is true, to demonstrate that someone else i s wrong, especially if they are guilty of some sort of crime or offense against the  law.

Ray says, “They’re both lacking in common sense.” R ay is referring to his two children, saying they are “lacking (lacking) in com mon sense.” “To lack” means not to have something, to be without something. “Co mmon sense” refers to the normal ability of people to understand the world, t o make rational decisions about the world around them. Ray says, “Everybody knows y ou should never sue an attorney, especially a successful one.”

We find out in the last sentence that Ray himself i s a lawyer. He is an attorney, and he was a successful one. He’s saying that his c hildren aren’t very smart. They lack common sense because they are trying to s ue their own father who himself is an attorney. There is, however, another expression in English that we could use here that Ray may not like, which is: “A person who represents himself in court” – that is, a person who tries to be his o wn attorney, as Ray’s doing – “has a fool for a lawyer.” That is, it’s never a go od idea to try to be your own attorney, your own lawyer.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
