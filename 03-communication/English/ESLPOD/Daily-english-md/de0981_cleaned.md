On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Andy and Marjorie about diplomatic and economic sanctions – when one country decides to punish another country or attempt to punish another countr y. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Andy: Well, it’s happened. 

Marjorie: What’s happened? 

Andy: The U.S. has placed diplomatic and economic s anctions on McQuillanland. It’s about time! The McQuillanland government has v iolated international law for the last time! 

Marjorie: That’s great, but what does it really mea n? 

Andy: Well, it means that all high-level talks betw een the U.S. and McQuillanland have been called off, and the U.S. embassy is closi ng. 

Marjorie: That sounds serious. 

Andy: You bet it is, and that’s just the beginning.  With economic sanctions, there’ll be serious consequences for business and t rade. There’ll be an embargo on U.S. companies doing business there, and there’l l be a naval blockade to enforce it. 

Marjorie: Wow, the McQuillanlanders have really don e it this time. 

Andy: They have. What made them think they could th umb their noses at us and get away with it?  

 Marjorie: I have no idea, but they’re about to find  out what the repercussions are when they flout international law!

Andy says to Marjorie, “Well, it’s happened.” Marjo rie says, “What’s happened?” Andy says, “The U.S. has placed diplomatic and econ omic sanctions on McQuillanland.” “McQuillanland,” of course, is that  country that very few people have visited, but it’s really a very beautiful coun try, I’m told. “Diplomatic” (diplomatic) refers to things dealing with other co untries. “Diplomatic sanctions” (sanctions) refer to actions that a country takes i n order to show another country that they don’t like what that other country is doi ng. It could involve, for example, closing your country’s embassy in another country –  removing your country’s official representatives from that country.  

“Economic sanctions” are usually financial penaltie s that are forced on a country. It may involve, for example, saying to the companie s in your country that they can’t sell to anyone in this other country. That’s a very common type of economic sanction. “Sanctions” are things that countries do to try to force other countries to change their policies, basically.  

Andy says, “It’s about time.” That expression, “it’ s about time,” is used to show that you are happy that something has finally happe ned that you wanted to have happen. “It’s about time” is usually used when some thing should have happened a long time ago but hasn’t, and now, finally, it ha s happened. If you’ve been dating your girlfriend for many years and finally y ou ask her to marry you, your girlfriend and your girlfriend’s parents might say,  “It’s about time.” Well, in this case, it’s about time that the U.S. placed diplomat ic and economic sanctions on McQuillanland, according to Andy.  

“The McQuillanland government,” Andy says, “has vio lated international law for the last time.” “To violate” (violate) means to bre ak a rule, to do something that is illegal or wrong. “International law” refers to law s that affect many different countries in many different parts of the world. “In ternational law” is something that requires everyone agree on what the law is. Th at, of course, is a rather serious problem many times, but in this case the Mc Quillanland government, according to Andy, “has violated international law”  – has broken the laws – “for the last time.”  

The expression “for the last time” means they won’t  do it again, presumably because the U.S. is putting these sanctions on McQu illanland. Marjorie says,  

“That’s great, but what does it really mean?” What is the consequence of this? Andy says, “Well, it means that all high-level talk s between the U.S. and McQuillanland have to be called off, and the U.S. E mbassy is closing.” “High- level talks” would be important discussions between  members of different governments at a very high level. That is, the pres ident, the vice president – the most important leaders of the country – are talking  to the most important leaders of another country.  

“To be called off” is a phrasal verb meaning to be canceled, to have something ended even though it was planned or scheduled. If y ou and I decide to meet tomorrow for lunch, and I say, “Well, I’m going to have to call off our meeting,” that means I have to cancel our meeting. “To call o ff” is usually used for business or official meetings. You wouldn’t use that if you were going to meet your girlfriend tomorrow night. You wouldn’t say, “I hav e to call off our meeting.” You would have to say, “I have to cancel our meeting be cause . . .” and you have to then make up some excuse why you’re not going to me et your girlfriend. But that’s your problem.  

Our problem is these sanctions against McQuillanlan d. Andy says, “The U.S. Embassy is closing” in McQuillanland. The “embassy”  (embassy) is the building with the offices of the official representatives of  a country in another country. The official representatives include the main or most i mportant representative, called the “ambassador” (ambassador). Marjorie says, “That  sounds serious.” Andy says, “You bet it is,” meaning yes, that’s right. “ And that’s just the beginning. With economic sanctions there’ll be serious consequences  for business and trade.” “Trade” (trade) refers to selling and buying things  from another country or from a company in another country.  

Andy says, “There’ll be an embargo on U.S. companie s doing business there, and there’ll be a naval blockade to enforce it.” An  “embargo” (embargo) is when companies are not allowed to buy and sell things fr om another country. All companies are forbidden to sell or buy things from any company in this other country. We would call that a “trade embargo.” Ther e is also something called an “arms (arms) embargo.” That would be when you preve nt or try to prevent anyone from selling weapons to another country.  

This embargo, according to Andy, will be enforced b y a “naval blockade.” “To enforce” (enforce) is to make sure that people foll ow, or obey, the law or the rule that you have established. “Naval” (naval) refers t o ships on the ocean or, specifically, to the military ships of a country. A  “blockade” (blockade) is when you prevent anything from leaving or coming into a certain area – in this case, a certain country. It would be very unusual for any c ountry to have a naval  

blockade to enforce a trade embargo. That might hap pen for an arms embargo, but usually not for a trade embargo. But McQuillanl and apparently is a very serious violator of international law, and so this is considered necessary. 

Marjorie says, “Wow, the McQuillanlanders” – people  who live in McQuillanland – “have really done it this time,” meaning they’ve do ne something really wrong. Andy says, “They have. What made them think they co uld thumb their noses at us and get away with it?” “To thumb (thumb) your no se at” someone is an interesting expression meaning to act disrespectful ly towards someone or to disobey a law – to not follow a law and not really care that you’re not following the law.  

Andy says that the McQuillanlanders have thumbed th eir nose at us and they think they can get away with it. “To get away with”  something is to do something bad, but not to be punished. When you break a law b ut you’re not caught, that would be “to get away with it.” Marjorie says, “I h ave no idea,” meaning I don’t know how they thought they could get away with it, “but they are about to find out what the repercussions are when they flout national  law!”  

“Repercussions” (repercussions) are negative conseq uences of something, bad things that happen as a result of something else. “ To flout” (flout) means to ignore a law or a rule – to break a rule even thoug h you know that you’re not supposed to. That’s “to flout the law” or “to flout  a rule.” 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
