This episode is a dialogue between Joachim and Dawn.  Th ey’re going to be talking about spying, trying to get secret information f rom another company, and in the process they’ll use a lot of different vocabulary to talk about spying and corporate secrets.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Joachim:  I’m really having second thoughts about hiring a  firm to do corporate spying for us.  I don’t want to do anything that’s ethica lly questionable.

Dawn:  We have no choice but to do it.  All of our comp etitors conduct corporate espionage.

Joachim:  I can understand spying on our competitors, but I draw the line at having us snoop on our own employees.

Dawn:  We wouldn’t unless our backs were against the wall .  I know you’re thinking about Hewer Placket hiring investigators to find  a leak in their company. I’m sure it was a hard decision for them, but they couldn ’t allow anyone in their own company to leak trade secrets.

Joachim:  True, it was necessary, but I don’t like being d eceptive with our own employees.  I won’t allow wiretaps or any invasion of pri vacy.

Dawn:  Our first priority would be damage control, no t privacy.  In any case, we’re not making a decision to spy within the company right now.   We’re only after our rival’s information.  The investigators we’re hiring kno w the difference between

 legal and illegal spying.  They’ll schmooze at trade show s, scour legal records, and do other things like that.  They’ll know where to d raw the line.

Joachim:  I hope you’re right.  I don’t want to end up  on the front page of the Times!

Our dialogue begins with Joachim saying, “I’m really havin g second thoughts about hiring a firm to do corporate spying for us.”  Wh en someone says they have “second thoughts” about something, they mean that th ey feel like, perhaps, they made the wrong decision, that they need to change their mind about something.  You are reconsidering an issue.  Joachim is havi ng second thoughts about hiring (paying) a company (a firm) to do corporat e spying for them. “Corporate spying” is trying to find out as much as you can  about another company, including information that may not be publicly a vailable.  Joachim says, “I don’t want to do anything that’s ethically questionab le.”  When we talk about something being “ethical,” or the adverb “ethically,” w e mean right or wrong, good or bad, moral or immoral.  Lying, according to most peo ple, is ethically wrong.  Or we might just say it’s “unethical.”  When someone says its “ unethical,” they mean it’s not ethical – it’s not right.  Joachim says it’s “ethica lly questionable.” Something that is “questionable” is problematic; it is so mething that may be right but may not be right, it may not be very clear.

Dawn says, “We have no choice but to do it (we have to do  it).  All of our competitors (the people who have similar companies) cond uct corporate espionage.”  “Espionage” (espionage) is just another wor d for spying, to send somebody to find out secret information about another organization, another person, and, of course, another country.

Joachim says, “I can understand spying on our competitors, bu t I draw the line at having us snoop on our own employees.”  The expression “to draw the line at something” means that this is the last thing you are will ing to do; the most extreme thing you are willing to do.  So you may do a l ot of different things, each one moving more and more towards a point where you don ’t want to do any more.  For example, someone may cheat on an exam in a te acher’s class, and the teacher says, “Okay, I’m going to forgive you.”  Then the student cheats again and the teacher says, “I’ll forgive you this time, but I’m going to draw the line at two times that you cheat.  After that, I won’ t forgive you.”  So, that’s to draw the line at something.

 Joachim draws the line at snooping on his own employees.  To “snoop” (snoop) means to spy; it means the same thing as spying on someon e, getting secret information from them.  Sometimes we use the word “s noop” to refer to something that isn’t quite as serious as spying; trying to find out information about another person, but it’s not exactly trying to ge t secret information about them.  So, “snoop” is often used as a more informal, pe rhaps less serious kind of spying.

Dawn says, “We wouldn’t (meaning we would not snoop on our own employees) unless our backs were against the wall.”  The expression “t o have your back against the wall” means that you do not have any other o ptions; you have only one thing that you can do; you are desperate.  “Our ba cks are against the wall” – we have to do this, we have no other choice.  Dawn says, “I  know you’re thinking about Hewer Placket hiring investigators to find a leak in their company.”  Dawn is talking about another company called Hewer Placket, wh ich of course is not a real company – although it does sound a lot like a famo us computer company that was spying on its own employees and finding informa tion about them.  But, that’s just a coincidence!

This other company, then, had hired investigators to find  a leak (leak).  A “leak” is someone who is giving secret information to people outsi de of your organization or company; it’s allowing secret information to somehow end up in the hands of another person outside of your organization.  This is a problem in government, when the government tries to keep secret information a nd then somebody takes that from inside the government and gives it, for examp le, to a newspaper.  That would be called a “leak.”  The word “leak” has a coupl e of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

So, Dawn is saying yes, I know you’re thinking about that o ther company, “I’m sure it was a hard decision for them, but they couldn’t a llow anyone in their company to leak trade secrets.”  “Trade secrets” refers to se cret information about how you do your business – how you conduct your busi ness.  Trade secrets would be anything that a company doesn’t want othe r people to know. For example, Coca-Cola doesn’t want anyone to know its r ecipe, how it makes its soda; that would be a trade secret.

Joachim says, “True, it was necessary (for this other company to  snoop on their own employees), but I don’t like being deceptive with ou r own employees.”  To be “deceptive” means to lie, to not tell the truth.  S o, Joachim doesn’t want to lie to his own employees.  He says, “I won’t allow wiretaps or  any invasion of privacy.”  “Wiretaps” (wiretaps) is when someone listens sec retly to your conversation, either on the telephone or in a building  somewhere; they’re

 listening and usually recording your conversation withou t your knowledge.  This is something that the government in many countries, includ ing this country, has done with its own citizens to get information about the m.  This is a very controversial issue in the United States, wiretapping Ame rican citizens or others to get to get information usually for reasons of nation al security – or at least that’s the official reason!  An “invasion of privacy” is when some one violates your right to keep your personal information secret.  “Privacy” refer s to a situation where no one can see you or observe you, or know about what you are  doing.  An “invasion” is normally when one country goes into another country using military force, an army or a navy for example.  Here, “invasion of  privacy,” however, means that your privacy has not been kept; someone has been  observing you without your permission.

Dawn says, “Our first priority (our first thing that we n eed to do – the most important thing) would be damage control, not privacy.”   “Damage control” is when you try to make a bad situation look better than it  is, to make it as good as you can.  So something goes wrong and your company, for exa mple, makes a product that doesn’t work.  Well, you want to do damag e control; you want to make sure the problem is not any worse or gets any worse, perhaps by refunding the money to all of your customers.

Dawn says, “In any case, we’re not making a decision to spy wi thin the company right now (inside the company).  We’re only after our r ival’s information.”  “Rival” is another word for a competitor, a person or a compan y that you are competing against that, perhaps, sells the same kind of thing as you  do.  Dawn says, “The investigators we’re hiring know the difference between l egal and illegal spying. They’ll schmooze at trade shows, scour legal records, and do  other things like that.”  To “schmooze” (schmooze) means to have a casual, i nformal conversation with other people, usually so that you can get to know m ore important people so that you can make contacts.  Another verb we use here would  be to “network,” to meet other people in your particular industry, your part icular field, in order to find more information or perhaps to get a better job; the re are a lot of reasons why someone might schmooze.  To “scour” (scour) means to look th rough many things trying to find a very specific piece of information .  “Scour” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Dawn says these investigators “know where to draw the line .”  Joachim says, “I hope you’re right.  I don’t want to end up on the fr ont page of the Times!” – I don’t want, at the end of this situation, for my name or pict ure to be on the front page of the newspaper, The New York Times .  Usually in the U.S., when someone refers to the Times, they’re usually talking about the la rgest, or one of the largest

 national newspapers, The New York Times .  There are, however, many newspapers call the Times, including here in Los Angeles,  The Los Angeles Times .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
