This episode is called “Admiring Someone from Afar. ”  When you see someone that you like at a distance, that’s what we’re talk ing about here.  It’s going to be about love, of course.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Perry:  Look at her!  What I wouldn’t give to get a  date with her. 

Lynn:  You should go talk to her and ask her for he r number. 

Perry:  No way!  She’s completely out of my league.   See that guy she’s talking to?  He’s the kind of guy who’ll get her number. 

Lynn:  That guy has nothing on you.  The only thing  that guy has that you don’t is confidence.   

Perry:  See?  She’s giving him her number.  I don’t  have a chance.   

Lynn:  But look what he’s doing with it.  He’s thro wing it away.  What a jerk!  Wait here. 

Perry:  Hey, where are you going? 

Lynn:  I’ve got it.  Here it is.  Here’s her number .  Call her. 

Perry:  Call her?!  Out of the blue?  You’re crazy.   She’ll think I’m some kind of creep. 

Lynn:  No, she’ll think you’re being bold.  She’ll love that. 

Perry:  What am I supposed to say to her?  “Hi, I s tole your phone number and I’d like a date.” 

Lynn:  No, tell her the truth.  Tell her you saw he r, admired her from afar, and wanted to ask her out.   

Perry:  What if she asks me how I got her number? 

Lynn:  Tell her you’ll tell her that when you see h er on your first date.  You’ll come off as mysterious.  She’ll eat it up. 

Perry:  I can’t do it.  There’s no way I could do t hat, could I? 

Lynn:  Yes you can.  After all, no guts, no glory! 

[end of dialogue] 

Perry begins our dialogue by saying to Lynn, “Look at her!  What I wouldn’t give to get a date with her.”  The expression “what I wo uldn’t give” means that you want something very much; you’re willing to do a lo t in order to get it.  Perry sees this woman, obviously a beautiful woman, and wants to have a date with her.  A “date” is a meeting between two people who may be r omantically interested in each other, although we use the word “date” sometim es for other meanings as well.  “Date” can mean the day on the calendar, the  month and day and year of something.  It can also be used sometimes for a non -romantic meeting, but here it’s definitely a meeting that Perry would like to be romantic. 

Lynn says, “You should go talk to her and ask her f or her number.”  Her “number” is, of course, her telephone number.  Now this is t he obvious thing that a woman might say to a man.  But a man – most men, anyway, are somewhat afraid of going up and talking to a strange woman, so Perry r eplies, “No way (meaning absolutely not)!  She’s completely out of my league  (league).”  The expression “to be out of your league” means that someone or someth ing is too good or of such high quality that you don’t feel you are worthy.  W hen you say a woman is out of your league, you would mean she’s so beautiful, she ’s so attractive that she would not be interested in someone as ugly as you –  well, as ugly as me!  Well this, of course, is an excuse for Perry not to go t alk to her.  He says, “See that guy she’s talking to?”  Apparently, this beautiful woman is talking to another man. “He’s the kind of guy who’ll get her number.”  He’s  the sort of person – the sort of man who will be able to get her to give him her num ber. 

Lynn says, “That guy has nothing on you.”  The expr ession “to have nothing on (someone)” means that you are as good as that perso n; that person has no advantages over you.  Lynn says, “The only thing th at guy has that you don’t is confidence.”  “Confidence” is the feeling that you are able to do something because you have the ability.  Speaking in English as a foreign language or a second language requires confidence.  If you have c onfidence, usually you’ll speak better.   

Well, poor Perry doesn’t have confidence in himself .  Perry says, “See?  She’s giving him her number.  I don’t have a chance.”  I don’t have any way I can be successful.  Lynn says, “But look what he’s doing w ith it.  He’s throwing it away.” “To throw (something) away” means to put it in the trash; to dispose of it, we might say.  It can also be used to mean to waste an  opportunity.  But here it means, I think, that he’s taking the piece of paper  and he’s putting it in a trashcan.  Lynn says, “What a jerk!  Wait here.”  “ What a jerk” is Lynn describing this other man, and so she tells Perry to wait wher e he is.  Perry says, “Hey, where are you going?”  Lynn says, “I’ve got it.  He re it is.  Here’s her number. Call her.”  So Lynn goes over and picks up the tele phone number that the other man threw away and tells Perry to call her.  Well, this is rather strange.  Perry says, “Call her?!  Out of the blue?”  The expressio n “out of the blue,” like the color blue (blue), means unexpectedly, without warn ing, for something to happen without any indication that it was going to happen.   This woman, of course, doesn’t even know Perry, may not have even seen him , so if he calls her it would be completely unexpected; it would be out of the bl ue.  Perry says, “You’re crazy.”  I think Perry’s right; Lynn is a little cr azy here.  I mean, he doesn’t even know this woman, the woman doesn’t even know who he  is.  Perry says, “She’ll think I’m some kind of creep.”  A “creep” (creep) i s the same as a jerk.  It’s a negative way of describing someone who behaves in a  bad or very unlikable way. 

Lynn says, “No, she’ll think you’re being bold.”  “ To be bold” (bold) means to be confident, to have courage, to show an ability to t ake risks, not to be fearful. Lynn says, “She’ll love that.”  Perry says, “What a m I supposed to say to her? ‘Hi, I stole your phone number and I’d like a date. ’”  “Stole” (stole) is the past tense of “steal” (steal), which means to rob someon e, to take something that isn’t yours.  Perry says that he can’t really call up thi s woman and say that he stole her telephone number.  Lynn says, “No, tell her the  truth.  Tell her that you saw her, admired her from afar, and wanted to ask her o ut.”  “To admire (someone)” means to like them very much, to respect them very much.  It doesn’t have a romantic meaning in all cases: you can admire a pre sident, you can admire a famous person, you could admire your parents, peopl e that you respect.  We sometimes use the phrase “to look up to.”  “I look up to my father.”  I think he’s a  

great man; I admire him.  It can also be used in th e sense of thinking that someone is beautiful; that’s how Lynn is using it h ere.  She says he should tell this woman that he admired her from afar (afar).  “ Afar” means at a distance, from a distance, far away.  Lynn says he should ask  her out.  “To ask (someone) out” means to ask them to go on a date with you, a romantic date.    

Perry says, “What if she asks me how I got her numb er?”  Lynn responds, “Tell her you’ll tell her when you see her on your first date.  You’ll come off as mysterious.  She’ll eat it up.”  “To come off as” m eans to make other people believe a certain thing, to see you in a certain wa y, to leave a certain impression on someone.  “He came off as an intelligent person, ” that is the impression that I got from him, that is my idea of him from that situ ation or that encounter.  “He came off as a jerk,” that would be a very negative way of describing your impression of someone, or “a creep.”  Well, Lynn th inks that Perry will come off as “mysterious,” something or someone that is diffi cult to understand or identify. She says this woman will eat it up.  “To eat it up”  means to accept something eagerly, usually because you want to believe it.  I t’s something that you believe perhaps already and so when someone tells you, you accept it very quickly. 

Perry says, “I can’t do it.  There’s no way I could  do that, could I?”  Lynn says, “Yes you can.  After all, no guts, no glory!”  This  is an old expression, “no guts (guts), no glory (glory).”  “Guts” is courage, stre ngth, bravery.  “Glory” is something wonderful that happens, something that yo u want to happen that will give you great pleasure or perhaps great fame.  So the expression “no guts, no glory” means that if you don’t take any risks, if y ou’re not brave and courageous, then you won’t gain anything; you won’t be able to get something that you want. There’s another expression, “no pain, no gain,” mea ning in order to get something good you often have to go through some pa in.  And certainly, asking a woman out on a date, for a man, can be pretty painf ul! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Perry:  Look at her!  What I wouldn’t give to get a  date with her. 

Lynn:  You should go talk to her and ask her for he r number. 

Perry:  No way!  She’s completely out of my league.   See that guy she’s talking to?  He’s the kind of guy who’ll get her number. 

Lynn:  That guy has nothing on you.  The only thing  that guy has that you don’t is confidence.   

Perry:  See?  She’s giving him her number.  I don’t  have a chance.   

Lynn:  But look at what he’s doing with it.  He’s t hrowing it away.  What a jerk! Wait here. 

Perry:  Hey, where are you going? 

Lynn:  I’ve got it.  Here it is.  Here’s her number .  Call her. 

Perry:  Call her?!  Out of the blue?  You’re crazy.   She’ll think I’m some kind of creep. 

Lynn:  No, she’ll think you’re being bold.  She’ll love that. 

Perry:  What am I supposed to say to her?  “Hi, I s tole your phone number and I’d like a date.” 

Lynn:  No, tell her the truth.  Tell her you saw he r, admired her from afar, and wanted to ask her out.

Perry:  I can’t do it.  There’s no way I could do t hat, could I? 

Lynn:  Yes you can.  After all, no guts, no glory! 

[end of dialogue] 

Well, she comes off as mysterious; she’s admired fr om afar; that’s because no one knows what she looks like.  It’s our own script writer, Dr. Lucy Tse.  Thanks, Lucy!
