This episode is called “Describing Speech and Language Abi lity.”  It’s a dialogue between Blaire and Antonio.  They are talking to someo ne who speaks a different language and they are having difficulty communicating wit h that person, something I’m sure we all have an experience with.  W e’re going to look at some vocabulary that we use to describe someone’s language abi lity and the way they speak.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Blaire:  Do you have any idea what he’s saying? 

Antonio:  It’s Greek to me.  You’re supposed to be the one who’s fluent.  Can’t you make out what he’s saying? 

Blaire:  I never said I was fluent.  I said I could ge t by in the language.  There’s a big difference. 

Antonio:  Why don’t you try saying something to him?   

Blaire:  What should I say?   

Antonio:  How about, “I don’t have a good command of the language.  Could you please speak more slowly?” 

Blaire:  I don’t think speaking more slowing will help my comprehension. Besides, I only know a few stock phrases, and even those I can  only say haltingly, if I don’t freeze up altogether. 

 Antonio:  Give me the phrase book.  I’ll see if I can ge t through to him. 

Blaire:  What are you going to say? 

Antonio:  I don’t know, but we’re two fairly articulat e people.  We should be able to cobble together a few sentences to get our point acr oss, don’t you think? 

Blaire:  Okay, I’ll follow your lead, but, um, just don ’t say anything insulting…like last time. 

Antonio:  Are you bringing that up again?!  It’s not  my fault that the entire town misinterpreted what I said!  I was trying to compliment  the women, not insult them. 

Blaire:  Tell that to the men who ran you out of tow n!

Our dialogue between Blaire and Antonio begins with Blaire asking, “Do you have any idea what he’s saying?”  Do you know what this per son is saying?  She doesn’t understand him.  Antonio says, “It’s Greek to me.”   This is an old expression that means I don’t understand anything that I ’m hearing or anything that I’m reading, usually because it’s too difficult or  it’s too technical.  “It’s Greek to me,” Greek being the language of Greece, of course.  The idea is that that would be very difficult for someone to understand.  I’m not sure the exact origin of that expression, but that is the expression we use when  something is very difficult to understand, and you don’t understand any of  it. 

Antonio says, “You’re supposed to be the one who’s fluent .”  “To be fluent” means that you can listen to, understand, and speak a lang uage very well.  So, Antonio is saying to Blaire well, you said you were flue nt – you are supposed be fluent in this language; we don’t know what language it is.  Antonio says, “Can’t you make out what he’s saying?”  The verb “to make out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to be able to understand or see something that is difficult to understand or see.  So in this case, the language is diff icult; to make out what he’s saying would be to understand, even though it is dif ficult.  “To make out” also has an informal meaning – very different.  It woul d mean, usually, for a romantic couple to express their physical affection – their  physical liking of each other some way, by kissing for example.  It’s a word that you would probably hear high school students use more than anything.  Althou gh since I didn’t have a girlfriend in high school, I never used the word mysel f that much. 

 Anyway, back to our dialogue, not my personal history!  Ant onio says, “Can’t you make out what he’s saying,” and Blaire says, “I never said  I was fluent.  I said I could get by in the language.”  “To get by” means that  you are able to survive; you are able to do something, but not very well.  In th is case, to get by in a language means you could survive in a country that spoke tha t language, but you would not do very well in speaking it.  “Get” is one of  those verbs that has dozens of meanings, for a few of them, take a look at our Lea rning Guide for some explanations.   

Blaire says there’s a big difference between getting by a nd being fluent.  Antonio says, “Why don’t you try saying something to him?”  Blaire asks, “What should I say?”  Antonio says, “How about, ‘I don’t have a good com mand of the language.’”  “To have a good command of (something)” means to understand something very well, to be an expert in something, to h ave a lot of knowledge about something.  It could be anything, not just lang uages; you could have a good command of computer programming, you could have a g ood command of podcasting.  Here, it’s being used to refer to how goo d you are – how fluent you are in a language.   

Antonio says that Blaire should say to the man, “I don’t have a good command of the language.  Could you please speak more slowly?”  Blai re says, “I don’t think speaking more slowing will help my comprehension.”  Actual ly, it probably will, but…  “Comprehension” means an understanding of what you  are reading or what you are hearing.  Blaire says, “Besides (in addition ), I only know a few stock phrases.”  A “stock (stock) phrase” is a group of words that you have memorized when you are speaking another language, especially if you  can’t think of something on your own.  Stock phrases would be things like : “Hello.”  “How are you?”  “Nice to meet you.”  “Can you tell me where the bathroom is?”  That last one is very important in every language!   

Blaire says that she only knows a few stock phrases, “and even  those I can only say haltingly.”  “To speak haltingly” (haltingly) means ver y slowly and with hesitation, or periods of silence between the words.  Th is is very common if you are a beginner in a language, you will speak haltingl y.  You’ll say something and then you’ll stop and you’ll think and you’ll say something else; that’s to speak haltingly.  Blaire says she only speaks haltingly “if I don ’t freeze up altogether.” “To freeze up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to be  unable to do or say anything, usually because you’re very nervous or frightened : “I saw a beautiful woman and I went up to her to ask her name.  And then , when I opened my mouth, I froze up.”  “Froze” being the past tense of “f reeze.”  I wasn’t able to do anything, I was too nervous; I froze up.  That’s why I d idn’t have any girlfriends in high school!  

 Blaire is saying that she is too nervous and she doesn’t kno w very much of the language to speak.  So, Antonio says, “Give me the phra se book.  A “phrase book” is a small book that has different expressions in a foreign language. People often have them when they travel to a country whe re they don’t speak the language, so it helps them find the words they need to say what they mean. Phrase books are almost always bilingual by definition, so you have the phrase in your language and then in the language you’re trying t o speak.  Antonio says, “Give me the phrase book.  I’ll see if I can get through  to him.”  “To get through to (someone)” means to help someone understand what you ar e saying, to communicate your ideas to someone.   

Antonio is going to try to use the phrase book to get th rough to this man.  Blaire says, “What are you going to say?”  Antonio says, “I don’t know, but we’re two fairly articulate people.”  “Articulate” means to be ab le to speak clearly and to be understood, to communicate your ideas in a way that othe r people can understand.  Antonio says, “We should be able to cobble t ogether a few sentences to get our point across, don’t you think?”  “To cobble (cobble) together” is a two-word verb meaning to use different  pieces of information to create something useful, especially if you don’t have a clea r plan about what you’re doing.  If you have a situation that you didn’t expect, you may need to cobble together a solution; take a little information from here, take some help from over here, and put them together so that you can su rvive – you can get through the situation. 

Antonio is saying that he and Blaire should be able to  cobble together a few sentences – put together a few sentences – to get their  point across.  “To get your point across” means to be able to communicate your id eas so that someone else understands them.  It’s similar to the expression “to get through to,” although “to get through to” can often mean the person is someho w not very bright or has some difficulty understanding you.  “To get your point a cross” is something that we would probably use more in a debate or a discussion or  a formal presentation to someone. 

Blaire says, “Okay, I’ll follow your lead.”  “To follow ( someone’s) lead” (lead) means to do what another person is doing, to imitate so meone else’s behavior, to copy what they’re doing, or to let them be the person t hat guides the conversation and you’re going to listen to what they’re saying and then try to say things that would be supportive of that.  Blaire says, “ just don’t say anything insulting…like last time.”  Antonio says, “Are you bringin g that up again?!”  “To bring (something) up,” or “to bring up (something)” i s another two-word phrasal verb meaning to talk about something from the past, to introduce a new topic.  It  

 could mean either of those things.  “Don’t bring that up again” means don’t talk about that negative or bad situation from the past.  Y ou can also use “bring up” to mean introduce a new topic of conversation: “I’d like to bring up something we haven’t discussed yet.”  So, it can mean both things. 

Well, obviously Antonio did something in the past that B laire is referring to – that Blaire is talking about.  He says, “It’s not my fault tha t the entire town misinterpreted what I said!”  Obviously, Antonio had ano ther problem in using a foreign language, some negative thing that happened that Blaire is bringing up again.  He says, “It’s not my fault that the entire tow n misinterpreted what I said!” “To misinterpret” means to misunderstand, to think that someone is saying something different than what they really are.  Antoni o says, “I was trying to compliment the women, not insult them.”  So apparentl y, we can only guess, Antonio said something about some women.  He was trying  to say something nice about them – something complimentary, but he proba bly didn’t know the language very well and so he, instead, insulted them, s aid something negative about the women, wherever they were. 

Blaire says, “Tell that to the men who ran you out of town!”  “To run (someone) out of town” means to make someone leave your city or your  town, usually because they have done something wrong and no one wants t hem there anymore.  Blaire is saying that Antonio thinks that he wa s misinterpreted, but she says that the people who misinterpreted him would have a  different opinion.  So, “Tell that to the men who ran you out of town” means tell that to the men who were angry at what he had said about the women in thi s particular place. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Blaire:  Do you have any idea what he’s saying? 

Antonio:  It’s Greek to me.  You’re supposed to be the one who’s fluent.  Can’t you make out what he’s saying?
