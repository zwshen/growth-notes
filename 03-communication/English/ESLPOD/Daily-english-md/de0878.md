This episode is a dialogue between Julio and Paula about getting injured – having something bad happen to your body. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialog]

Julio:  Hi, Aunt Louisa, it’s Julio.

Paula:  ...And Paula.  I’m on the extension in the kitchen.

Julio:  Anyway, we just wanted to call and wish you  a speedy recovery.  Get plenty of bed rest and take it easy. Avoid greasy o r spicy foods and drink lots of liquids. You don’t want to become dehydrated.

Paula:  Don’t listen to him.  You need to stay acti ve and not get in the habit of sitting around.  You’ll recover faster if you get u p and move around a lot.

Julio:  That’s terrible advice.  She needs rest and  to eat right.  You know what they say: “Feed a cold, starve a fever.”

Paula:  What does that old adage have to do with an ything?  What you need, Aunt Louisa, is to alternate between a heating pad and an ice pack.

Julio:  What are you talking about?  Aunt Louisa ha s a bad cold.

Paula:  What?!  I thought she had a sore back!

Our dialogue begins with Julio talking on the phone  to his Aunt Luisa. Your “aunt” is the sister of either your mother or your father.  Julio says “Hi, Aunt Luisa, it's Julio.” Also, however, talking on the telephone is Paula. So after Julio says hello

to his aunt, Paula, whose on the extension in the k itchen, says hello. The “extension” is an additional telephone that is conn ected to the same phone number, to the same line, so that two people in one  office or one house can both talk to someone. Of course, this is impossible on a  cell phone, but it is possible when you have the physical phone lines coming into your house or your building. We sometimes call that a “landline” (landline). A “ landline” is, you might call it, an old-fashioned phone. It's not a cellular phone. It' s not a mobile phone. It's a phone that is connected to your house with physical  wires.

Well, Paula and Julio are both talking to their Aun t Luisa. Paula is on the extension in the kitchen. Once again, extension is just another phone in the house or in the building. Julio says, “Anyway, we j ust wanted to call and wish you a speedy recovery.” That use of “anyway” at the beg inning of the sentence is very common in modern conversational English. It ca n be used in a number of different ways. Here it's used to change the subjec t or to return the conversation to the topic you were on before someone else change d it. Julio was talking to his Aunt Luisa and then Paula came in, shifting the att ention of the conversation to her. So, Julio wants to get back control, if you wi ll, of the conversation. So, he says “Anyway,” meaning paying attention to me now, “we just wanted to call and wish you a speedy recovery.” “Speedy” (speedy) mean s quick or fast. “Rapid” would be another term. “Recovery” (recovery) is whe n you get better after feeling sick or after being hurt. “Recovery” is getting bet ter from an illness. A “speedy recovery” would be doing that quickly. Paula and Ju lio are calling to wish their Aunt Luisa a speedy recovery. They're hoping she ge ts better soon.

Julio says, “Get plenty of bed rest and take it eas y.” “Bed rest” is simply lying in your bed, not getting up, not moving. “Take it easy ” is it general expression we use to mean relax. Try not to do anything that's di fficult. Take it easy. Sometimes, we use that expression as a way of saying goodbye t o someone. “Okay, well, it was nice to see you. Take it easy.” You’re really s ort of saying goodbye in that instance.

Here, Julio means exactly what he says. He wants hi s aunt to relax, to not do anything difficult. Then he says, “Avoid greasy or spicy foods.” “Greasy” (greasy) is food with a lot of oil and fat in it, like, I do n't know, duck or certain kinds of pork might be greasy. “Spicy” (spicy) is a very burning hot sensation produced in the mouth, usually by hot peppers. Certain kinds of foo d from certain countries can be spicy. Food from Mexico, for example, can be spi cy. Food from Thailand can be spicy. Lots of different countries have spicy fo ods as part of their traditional food. Julio is telling his aunt to avoid greasy, or  spicy foods. Don't eat them. Avoid them.

He says “Drink lots of liquids.” “Liquids” would be  things like water or milk or soda or tea. Those are all liquids. It's not unusual, for people who are recovering from certain kinds of sicknesses – to give this sort of advice. Julio says, “You don't want to become dehydrated.” “To be dehydrated” (deh ydrated) means to not drink enough water or not drink enough liquid so th at your body feels ill. It feels weak. If you go all day and you don't drink anythin g, any sort of liquid, your body might start to feel weak. It's becoming dehydrated.  “Hydration” has to do with water or liquid. “Dehydration” is when you don't ha ve enough water or liquid.

Paula says, “Don't listen to him.” Don't listen to Julio. “You need to stay active and not get in the habit of sitting around.” So, Pa ula comes on the phone and gives completely opposite advice to her Aunt Luisa.  I think Paula is Julio's sister. Sisters do this sometimes. They think that their br others don't know anything. I think my sister Kathy feels that way about me.

Anyway, Paula gives Aunt Luisa completely different  advice. She tells her to stay active. “To stay active” means to use your body for  physical activities, often to help maintain your health. So go to the gym or exer cise or jog around the block, run around the block. All these are ways of staying  active. “To get into the habit of something” means to get used to something so tha t you do it regularly. You continue to do it without having to think about it.  That's what a “habit” (habit) is. It's something you do all the time, regularly, with out really even thinking about it. I get up in the morning. I brush my teeth. I clean my  teeth. That's a habit. I don't have to write it down to remember. I just know that  that's what I do every morning. That is what Paula is talking about when s he is telling her aunt not to get in the habit of doing something, meaning don't make that a regular part of your day.

What doesn't Paula want her want to do? She doesn't  want her on getting in the habit of “sitting around.” “To sit around” means ju st to sit in a chair and not do anything, have no physical activity.

Paula says, “You'll recover faster” – you'll get be tter faster – “if you get up and move around a lot.” Julio says, “That's terrible ad vice.” That's bad advice, a very bad suggestion. “She needs rest and to eat right.” Julio is saying that is aunt needs to rest in bed and to eat the right foods. “You know what they say, ‘Feed a cold, starve a fever.’” This is an old expression. “To feed” means to give someone food. “Feed a cold” means when someone has a cold, they should continue  to eat. If someone has a “fever” (fever), where their body’s temperature is higher than it should be, then you don't give them food. “To starve” (starve) mean s not to have enough food. In this case, it simply means don't give someone food who has a fever, but if they

have a cold, you should give them food. You should feed them. I don't know if that is correct, however. I'm not a medical doctor ,so please don't take this as advice for your own illnesses and sickness!

Paula says, “What does that old adage have to do wi th anything?” An “adage” (adage) is a saying or a traditional expression. We  might also call it a “proverb” (proverb). Paula says, “What you need, Aunt Luisa, is to alternate between a heating pad and an ice pack.” “To alternate between  something and something else” means to go back and forth. First do one thin g, and then do another thing. In this case, first use a heating pad and then an i ce pack. A “heating pad” (pad) is something that you put on your body to make it warm . It's usually a piece of cloth or fabric that has electrical wires inside of it th at produce heat, so that if you hurt, for example, your leg, you can put this pad on, thi s cloth on, that will get hot and help it relax.

An “ice pack” (pack) is a small container of (usual ly) water that is frozen – that is to say, it's “ice” that is put into a small plastic  container or other small container and put on your body to keep yourself or part of yo ur body cold. For example, if you hurt yourself, you may put an ice pack on it so  that the injury doesn't get any worse or to help it recover. Both heating pads and ice packs are used for (typically) injuries to your muscles, when you hurt  some part of your body related to your muscles.

Julio says, “What are you talking about, Paula? Aun t Lisa has a bad cold.” Aunt Lisa did not hurt her muscles, did not have any sor t of physical injury. Instead, she has a cold, which usually involves having a sor e throat. You might be coughing, have a headache – all of these things are  part of having a cold. A cold is usually not a serious disease or serious illness , I should say.

Paula says, “What? I thought she had a sore back?” “Sore” (sore) is a part of your body that hurts. Paula thought that Aunt Luisa 's problem was a sore back, that she hurt the muscles in her back or some other  part of her back, and that's why she was telling her to stay active and to use a  heating pad or an ice pack. But of course, Julio knows what's going on here. (B rothers usually know more than sisters.) And he says “No, no, she just has a cold.”

Now let's listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed
