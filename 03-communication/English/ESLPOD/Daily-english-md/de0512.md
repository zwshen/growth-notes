This episode is a dialogue between Laura and Gaius talki ng about common expressions and phrases we use to change the subject (the to pic) of our conversations.  A very useful episode, I think you will find .  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Laura:  I think that’s all we need to talk about regar ding last month’s report.  Let’s turn to this month’s report, shall we?  I didn’t get a copy of it.  Could someone hand me one?

Gaius:  By the way, I have just one last comment before we shift our focus to this month’s report.  It seems to me that we need more info rmation on how the Duluth office is doing.  Could we ask for more info to be inclu ded in next month’s report?

Laura:  I’m sure we can.  Incidentally, Dee is quitting and Kara will be taking her place.  This is off the record, of course.  Okay, now back to this month’s report…

Gaius:  Speaking of personnel changes, did you know that  Lee is being promoted to V.P. next month?

Laura:  I hadn’t heard that, but I’m not surprised.   She’s been in line for that job for years.  Okay, we need to get back to this month’s repo rt…

Gaius:  Something just occurred to me.  If Lee is being  promoted, what will happen to the Baseship project?

Laura:  I think it’s being put on the back burner for n ow.  All right, could someone hand me a copy of this month’s report?

 Gaius:  I don’t mean to change the subject but…

Laura:  I think that’s precisely what you’re trying to do.   What’s the matter with this month’s report?

Gaius:  It’s not quite finished.  It’ll be on your de sk this afternoon.

Laura:  Is that what this tap dance has been about?  A ll right, we’ll talk about it at tomorrow’s meeting.  Next time, just give it to me strai ght, okay?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Laura saying that she thinks th at’s all they need to talk about regarding last month’s report.  We’re obviously he re in a business meeting, and Laura is the boss.  She’s telling Gaius that they don ’t need to talk about the report on what was done last month.  Instead, she wants to talk about this month’s report, so she says, “Let’s turn to this month’s re port, shall we?”  “To turn to (something)” is one of the many expressions we’ll discuss in this dialogue used to change the subject of a conversation.  It means let ’s begin talking about something else, let’s begin to focus on something differ ent.  It’s somewhat of a formal expression that might be used by someone who is r unning a meeting, who is leading a group in a discussion.  Laura says, “Let’s tur n to this month’s report, shall we?”  “Shall we” is a formal phrase inviting some one to join you in doing what you are doing.  “Shall we dance?” means do you wan t to dance with me. No?  Okay.  Then you go to the next girl, you see.  That  was always my strategy!

Laura says that she didn’t get a copy of this month’s repo rt, and asks if someone could hand her one.  “To hand (someone) (something)” m eans to give something to someone.  It’s a polite way of saying “please could you  give me this thing,” or “pass me this thing.”  “Could you hand me that pen, ple ase?” means could you give me that pen, take it and put it into my hand.  “H and” has several different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Gaius says, “By the way, I have just one last comment before  we shift our focus to this month’s report.”  “By the way” is a phrase used to  say that you want to continue talking about something but add a slightly diff erent topic, so it’s not a completely new subject.  If you say, “Let’s turn to the Ba seship project,” well, you’re saying I want to talk about something completely n ew, usually.  But if you say “by the way,” you mean that you have something additio nal to say about the topic you’re talking about now, but slightly different t han what you were just

 talking about.  So, Gaius says, “By the way, I have just on e last comment before we shift our focus to this month’s report.”  “To shift (sh ift) your focus” means to begin discussing a new or different topic; it’s similar to “to turn to.”  Gaius says, “It seems to me that we need more information on how the Duluth office is doing.” Duluth is a city in northern Minnesota.  Gaius says, “Could  we ask for more info (meaning information) to be included in next month’s r eport?”

Laura says, “I’m sure we can.  Incidentally, Dee is quitt ing and Kara will be taking her place.”  “Incidentally” (or, if it’s pronounced mo re carefully, “incidentally”) means that you want to add some additional information  about the topic that you were just discussing – usually that’s what it means.  Laura says that Dee is quitting and Kara will be taking her place.  Perhaps D ee and Kara both work in the Duluth office, so this is an additional piece of in formation related to the topic they were just discussing.  Then she says, “This is off the r ecord, of course.”  “Off the record” means unofficially.  It’s a phrase that you use  to tell people that the information you are giving them is secret.  It’s usually use d by government officials or other people who are being interviewed, f or example, by a newspaper reporter, and they don’t want something “on the record ,” meaning they don’t want something to be recorded – something to be written do wn.  That’s what “the record” is here; it’s an account of something; it’s a story or details about something.  So, “off the record” would mean I don’t want you to write this down or I don’t want you to tell anyone else I’m telling you.

Laura says, “Okay, now back to this month’s report…”  Gaius, however, says, “Speaking of personnel changes, did you know that Lee is b eing promoted to V.P. next month?”  “Speaking of” is a phrase used to show  that you want to add more information that is related to the topic just me ntioned.  Once again, it’s another way of changing the topic of the conversation, b ut what you’re really doing here is linking – connecting the information you’r e about to say with information that was just discussed.  So for example if I’m talking about going to New York City on a vacation and my friend has a relative,  someone who is part of his family that lives in New York, after I tell him my story, he may say to me, “Speaking of New York, I have an uncle who lives there, yo u know.”  So he’s connecting his topic to my topic.  Gaius says, “Speaking of p ersonnel changes (personnel refers to the people who work for a company) , did you know that Lee is being promoted to V.P. next month?”  “To be promot ed” means to get a better job, a job with more responsibility, a job that is hig her up in the company.

Laura then says, “I hadn’t heard that, but I’m not surp rised.  She (meaning Lee) has been in line for that job for years.  “To be in li ne for” means that you are the next person who will get something, you will be the ne xt person to receive something, or you are ready for something to happen.  Many people think

 California is in line for another major earthquake.  We’re in line for – we’re waiting for it to happen, it will happen.  We’re next, in ot her words.

Laura says, “Okay, we need to get back to this month’s repo rt…”  But Gaius doesn’t want to talk about this month’s report, He says, “ Something just occurred to me (meaning I just thought of something).  If Lee is being promoted, what will happen to the Baseship project (the name of a project they’re working on in their company)?”  Laura says, “I think it’s being put on the ba ck burner for now.”  “To put (something) on the back burner” means to delay someth ing or to stop focusing on something temporarily because it isn’t that important – it isn’t that urgent.  Laura is saying that that project will probabl y be delayed.  Then she says, “All right, could someone hand me a copy of this mont h’s report?” Remember, she asked for someone to give her a copy of the report at the beginning of the conversation.

Gaius says, “I don’t mean to change the subject but…”  “To  change the subject” means to changed topics, to stop discussing one thing and b egin discussing something else.  Laura interrupts him and says, “I think that’s precisely what you’re doing,” meaning you’re trying to change the subj ect so that we don’t talk about this month’s report.  “Precisely,” here, means exact ly – that’s exactly what you’re doing.  “What’s the matter with this month’s rep ort?” she finally asks. “What’s the matter with” means what’s wrong with.  It’ s something people use when something isn’t working correctly or isn’t behaving no rmally.  You could say it about a person: “What’s wrong with your brother?” –  he seems angry, why? Or, it could be something you use to talk about a machin e: “What’s wrong with my computer?  It stopped working.”  Oh, I poured water on it; well, okay, that’s why it stopped working!

Gaius says, “It’s not quite finished (meaning this month’ s report isn’t finished, he didn’t complete it).  It will be on your desk this after noon,” meaning I will give it to you this afternoon.  Laura then says, “Is that what this t ap dance has been all about?”  “Tap dance” normally is a kind of dance where so meone has special pieces of metal on their shoes – on the bottom of their  shoes that make noise. But the expression here means that someone is trying to av oid talking about or avoid doing something by talking about something else.  “I tap danced around the subject” – I didn’t want to talk about it so I talke d about other things.  It’s a negative expression in the sense that the person isn’t bei ng direct, they aren’t going right to the truth.  They’re trying to distract yo u by talking about other things, perhaps.  Laura says, “Next time, just give it to m e straight.”  This is the opposite of giving someone a tap dance.  “To give it to (someone) straight” means to tell the full truth, very directly, right away.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
