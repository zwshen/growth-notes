This episode is a dialogue between Claudia and Raul  about buying things from the store without ever really talking to anyone. Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Claudia: We’re done, right? Let’s get in this cashi er line.

Raul: No need. This store has self-checkout machine s.

Claudia: I don’t know. I think it would be easier g oing through a cashier line.

Raul: Using the self-checkout will be much quicker.  Let me show you. All you have to do is scan the bar codes on each grocery it em.

Claudia: There are no bar codes on fruits and veget ables.

Raul: All you have to do is put them on the scale a nd find the product on the touch screen.

Claudia: You look. I’ll start bagging.

Raul: Wait! You’re supposed to wait until everythin g is scanned before removing items from the bagging area to put in bags. Oh no, now there’s a “see attendant” message on the screen.

Claudia: What do we do now?

Raul: We wait for the attendant to clear the error and void the transaction. Then we start again.

 Claudia: Great. You’re right. This is much faster.

Raul: It is if you know what you’re doing.

Claudia: I’ll tell you what. I’ll take half of our groceries and stand in line and you use the self-checkout. We’ll see which is faster.

Raul: That’s a sucker bet. I have no doubt that I’l l be done before you are.

Claudia: I’m not worried. The last one out the door  makes dinner.

Raul: You’re on. Just remember that I like my steak  well done.

[end of dialogue]

Claudia begins our dialogue by asking Raul, “We’re done, right?” meaning “We agree that we are done now” or “I understand that w e are now finished. Is that correct?” “Let’s get in this cashier line.” A “cash ier” (cashier) is someone who takes your money at a store when you want to buy so mething. A “cashier line” would be a line of people waiting to buy things fro m the store – people who are waiting for the cashier to finish with the person i n front of them so they can then purchase what they came to the store to buy.

However, Raul says, “No need,” meaning we don’t nee d to stand in the cashier line. “This store has self-checkout machines.” The verb “to check out” means to give your money to someone from the store in order to buy what you want to buy. “Self-checkout” is a new system in many American st ores where you don’t have to give your money to a cashier, a person, a live h uman being. Instead, you can give your money to a machine. You basically stand i n front of the machine and the machine reads the information from the packagin g and tells you how much you have to pay.

Claudia says, “I don’t know.” What Claudia means he re is she’s not sure she wants to use the self-checkout machines. She is hes itant. She’s doubting whether this is a good idea. She says, “I think it would be easier to go through a cashier line.” She thinks it’s easier just to talk to human being and have them do all of the necessary things in order to figure out how much money you give them. Raul says, “Using the self-checkout will be much qu icker. Let me show you.” Let me demonstrate how you do this. So, Raul now is going to show Claudia how the self-checkout machine works.

He says, “All you have to do is scan the bar codes on each grocery item.” Claudia and Raul are in a grocery store. A “grocery  store” is a store that sells food. A “bar code” (bar code) is a little square wi th a bunch of black and white lines on it that is used by a computer to identify the specific thing that you are buying. Most things in American stores, including g rocery stores, have these little squares that have lines that are black and white, a nd usually some numbers on the bottom. We call these “bar codes.”

What do you do with the bar code? Well, you have to  put it in front of a machine, and the machine will scan it. “To scan” (scan) basi cally means the machine looks at the code and “reads” it to determine what you are buying. However, there’s a small problem with this system at a grocery store, and Claudia lets us know what that is in the very next sentence. She says, “There  are no bar codes on fruits and vegetables.”

Because each person picks his or her own fruits and  vegetables, there aren’t bar codes on the bags. You put them in your own little bags, and you take them and usually the cashier will look at it and then put in  the right item and amount. However, if you’re using a self-checkout machine, y ou need to do something a little different. And Raul tells us.

He says, “All you have to do is put them on the sca le and find the product on the touch-screen.” Notice that Raul starts this sentenc e by using the phrase “all you have to do.” That’s what he said earlier in the dia logue. It’s a very common phrase when you are explaining something to someone  and indicating that it isn’t difficult – it’s very easy. It’s not complicated.

Raul says, “You need to put the fruits and vegetabl es on this scale (scale).” A “scale” is a device, a machine, that tells you how heavy something is. It weighs the thing or the person. The verb we use when a per son weighs himself is “step on.” “He stepped on the scale to find out how fat h e was.” (Or how skinny – let’s be optimistic.)

Raul says that after you put the fruits and/or vege tables on the scale, you have to find them on the touch-screen. The “touch-screen” i s a flat computer screen that, when you touch it, something happens. It’s sort of like what we now have – tablets like iPads – where you can touch the screen  and something happens. They have these touch-screens with the self-checkou t machines in order to make things quicker. You don’t have to type anything wit h a keyboard.

Claudia says, “You look,” meaning you look for the name of this item, “I’ll start bagging.” “To bag” (bag), as a verb, means to put t hings into a container which is

called, confusingly, a “bag.” A “bag” can be made of plastic or paper or some other material, and we use bags to carry things aro und. When you go to a grocery store in the United States, they usually gi ve you either a paper or a plastic bag. Sometimes they charge you money for the bags, however, so many people bring their own bags from home. So, “to bag”  means to put something in a bag.

Raul says, “Wait! You’re supposed to wait until eve rything is scanned before removing items from the bagging area to put in bags .” The way the self-checkout machines work is that you put things on a flat surf ace, like a little table, called the “bagging area.” After you scan something, you then put it on this small table, but the table itself is connected to the machine, and i t can tell how much weight you are putting on the machine. It’s a way, I guess, for the grocery store company to make sure you’re not cheating. You can’t put things  into bags until you finished scanning all of your items. That’s what Raul says.

He says, “Oh no, now there’s a ‘see attendant’ mess age on the screen.” An “attendant” (attendant) is a person who works for, in this case, a store to help customers find things. The attendant here is helpin g customers use the self- checkout machine. So yes, although you don’t talk t o anyone, you do everything yourself in self-checkout, there will be an employe e from the store, an attendant, who will help you if you need help with the machine .

What happened is that Claudia made a mistake, and t he machine stopped and put a message on the screen which said “see attenda nt,” meaning you have to talk to the employee. Claudia says, “What do we do now?” Raul says, “We wait for the attendant to clear the error and void the t ransaction then we start again.” “To clear” (clear) means to delete or to erase some thing. “To void (void) a transaction” means basically to undo a sale – make something as though it had never happened.

So, let’s say you’re buying something at the store and the cashier makes a mistake, or you make a mistake, you give the cashie r the wrong thing. You can then say, “Oh no, no, I don’t want that.” The cashi er can “void the transaction.” A “transaction” is just, in this case, another word f or the sale of something. The cashier voids the transaction as though it had neve r existed. You delete it. You get rid of it. You erase it.

Claudia is not very happy that she now has to wait for the attendant. She says, “Great. You’re right. This is much faster.” Claudia  is being sarcastic here. She’s making a joke. She doesn’t think it’s much faster. She thinks the self-checkout is taking them longer than it would if they had used a  cashier. Raul says, “It is” –

meaning it is faster – “if you know what you’re doi ng.” Raul is saying that had Claudia not made a mistake, it would’ve been faster .

Claudia says, “I’ll tell you what. I’ll take half of our groceries and stand in line, and you use the self-checkout. We’ll see which is faste r.” The expression “I’ll tell you what” is an informal one used to present or propose  an idea to someone. You are giving someone an idea usually that has some sort of “If you do this, then that will happen.” “I’ll tell you what. If you give me $20, I  will give you a free English lesson.” “I’ll tell you what” is a way of introduci ng a proposal, something that I will do for you if you do something for me.

Here, it’s about Claudia and Raul each doing someth ing different. Claudia is going to go to the cashier, the human being, to buy  half of the groceries, half of the food that they are purchasing. Raul is going to  take the other half and go through the self-checkout machine, then they’ll see  who gets finished first – who “gets through the line,” if you will, or who checks  out first.

Raul says, “That’s a sucker bet. I have no doubt th at I’ll be done before you are.” A “sucker (sucker) bet (bet)” is a gambling offer t hat only someone who perhaps is inexperienced or not very intelligent would acce pt. The word “sucker” is used to describe someone who is a fool, someone who is e asily deceived, someone who other people, we would say, “take advantage of. ” A sucker bet would be a bet that only a stupid person would accept.

Claudia says, “I’m not worried. The last one out the door makes dinner.” “The last one out the door” means the person who finishes las t, the person who gets through the checkout process last, has to make dinn er. Raul says, “You’re on.” When you challenge someone to do something or you b et someone, one common way of replying is to say, “You’re on.” So, I say to you, “If you give me $20, I will teach you English.” You say, “You’re on ,” meaning “Yes, I’ll do that.” Normally, however, it’s when you’re betting about s omething.

Raul says, “Just remember that I like my steak well  done.” Raul is assuming that he’s going to win the bet, and he’s already telling  Claudia how he wants his steak cooked. He wants his steak, which is a thick piece of beef, “well done,” meaning there isn’t any redness inside of the meat.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
