This episode is a dialogue between Cassius and Brit tany about visiting holy places – churches, mosques, and temples. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Cassius: You’ll need to cover up if you want to go in there. This is a house of worship. 

Brittany: All right, if you say so. I don’t really want to go into this mosque or temple or whatever it is. 

Cassius: Keep your voice down. Can’t you see that t here are people at the altar in prayer? 

Brittany: I’ll just stay outside. Maybe I’ll walk o ver to that building over there with the dome and steeple. 

Cassius: That’s not a steeple. It’s a minaret, and that’s a mosque. You’re definitely not going in there dressed like that. 

Brittany: Why not? I’m curious about other religion s. I just want to see what it’s like inside and take lots of pictures. 

Cassius: These are holy places. You can’t just barg e into a house of worship to satisfy your curiosity.  

Brittany: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with  me wanting to observe local people worshipping their gods. I’m very interested in the local culture. 

Cassius: Would you like a tourist coming into your church and taking pictures of you while you’re in prayer? 

Brittany: I don’t belong to a church, but if I did,  I’d welcome anyone who wanted to have a look. 

Cassius: Other members of your congregation might n ot feel that way, but do what you like. I’ll be right here ready to dust you  off when they give you the boot!

Cassius begins our dialogue by saying to Brittany, “You’ll need to cover up if you want to go in there. This is a house of worship.” T he phrasal verb “to cover up” means to cover some part of your body – to hide you r face or to hide your hair or perhaps to hide your arms and legs. Sometimes women  especially are asked to cover up when they enter a certain building that is  used for a religious purpose. A building used for religious purposes is often calle d a “house of worship” (worship).  

A house of worship is a building where people come to pray. It is also used for religious ceremonies or religious celebrations. Bri ttany says, “All right, if you say so,” meaning if that’s what you’re telling me to do . “I don’t really want to go in to this mosque or temple or whatever it is.” She doesn ’t seem to be sure if the building is a “mosque” (mosque) or a “temple” (temp le). A “mosque” is a building where Muslims worship together, pray together. The verb “to worship” can mean to participate in a religious ceremony or a religio us event of some kind.  

Muslims worship in a mosque. A “temple” (temple) is  used for describing a house of worship for Jews, though it could also be used f or Mormons. We talk about a “Mormon temple.” That’s the house of worship of tho se who believe in the religion of Mormonism. But more commonly, it’s used  to refer to a place where Jews worship, which is also called a “synagogue” (s ynagogue). Brittany is unsure whether she’s going into a mosque or a temple.  

Cassius just says, “Keep your voice down.” That exp ression “keep your voice down” means don’t talk too loudly. “Can’t you see t hat there are people at the altar in prayer?” An “altar” (altar) is a kind of f urniture, I guess we could describe it, that is used in certain religious ceremonies or  sacrifices. In a Christian church, the altar would be in front of the building, typica lly. In some Christian churches, the altar looks like a big table, but in older chur ches, especially Catholic churches, the altar is up against the front wall of  the church.  

Cassius talks about people at the altar “in prayer”  – that is, they are speaking to God, perhaps thanking God or praising God or asking  God for something. Brittany says, “I’ll just stay outside. Maybe I’ll walk over to that building over there with the dome and steeple.” A “dome” (dome) is a ta ll, rounded top of a building. Sometimes churches and other houses of worship have  domes on top of them. But a dome can be on any kind of building. The U.S.  Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., is famous for its dome.  

A “steeple” (steeple) is a tall tower, or what we m ight call a “spire” (spire) that is often used in Christian architecture – in buildings  that are built for Christian worship. Brittany points to something thinking that  it’s a dome and a steeple. But Cassius corrects her. He says, “That’s not a steepl e. It’s a minaret, and that a mosque.” A particular kind of tower associated with  a mosque is called a “minaret” (minaret). It’s a tall, narrow tower typi cally found with a mosque.  

Cassius says, “You’re definitely not going in there  dressed like that.” It is likely that Brittany is not dressed appropriately to go in to this mosque. Brittany says, “Why not? I’m curious about other religions” – othe r organized systems of belief. “I just want to see what it’s like inside and take lots of pictures.” “To take pictures” means to take photographs. Cassius says, “These are  holy (holy) places.” Something that is “holy” is something that is dedic ated to or connected to God or some supernatural power or being. “To be holy” mean s to be “sacred” (sacred).  

The idea is that you would treat that with special respect. Cassius says, “You can’t just barge into a house of worship to satisfy  your curiosity.” “To barge (barge) into” somewhere is to enter a place suddenl y and loudly, often without permission to do so. If you barge into a meeting, y ou interrupt the meeting. You go in there making a bunch of noise and disturbing the people who are there already.  

Cassius says, “You can’t just barge into a house of  worship” – that is, a temple, a mosque, or a church – “to satisfy your curiosity.” “To satisfy your curiosity” (curiosity) means to find the answers to your quest ions about something. “Curiosity” is wanting to know about something, wan ting to know the answer to some question. So, “satisfying your curiosity” is g etting the answer or trying to get the answer for your questions.  

Brittany says, “I don’t think there’s anything wron g with me wanting to observe local people worshipping their gods.” The word “God ” (God), when it is capitalized (when it has a large letter) usually re fers to a single, supernatural power – what we would call a “deity” (deity), which  comes from the Latin word  

“dues,” meaning “God.” Sometimes you will see the w ord “God” written as a small (god), often with an “s” to make it plural so  it’s “gods.”  

Christians, Jews, and Muslims usually refer to thei r God in the singular, with no “s” at the end and a capital “G,” but you could ref er to, say, “gods of other religions.” These gods may still be supernatural in  their own belief systems. We could talk about the gods of the Greeks and the Rom ans, for example, who were in Greek and Roman religion considered supernatural  but there was more than one of them. I’ve been using the word “supernatural ” (supernatural). “Supernatural” means beyond our human experience an d power, beyond our nature.  

Brittany thinks she should be able to go into any p lace she wants “to observe local people,” as she calls them. She says, “I’m ve ry interested in the local culture.” “Local” here means of this particular are a or place. Cassius says, “Would you like a tourist” – someone visiting – “co ming into your church and taking pictures of you while you’re in prayer?” “To  be in prayer,” or “to be at prayer,” means to be praying – to be involved in th e act of speaking to or listening to God. Brittany says, “I don’t belong to  a church, but if I did, I’d welcome anyone who wanted to have a look.”  

She means that even though she isn’t a member of a church, if she were a member of a church, she would welcome – she would b e happy to have – people come in and look. Cassius says, “Other members of y our congregation might not feel that way, but do what you like.” A “congregati on” (congregation) is a group of people who meet regularly at a particular house of worship to pray. Cassius says that if Brittany were a member of a church, the oth er people who go to that church, the “congregation,” might not agree with he r.  

Cassius says, “I’ll be right here to dust you off w hen they give you the boot!” “To dust (dust) someone off” is a two-word phrasal verb  meaning to help someone who has fallen down by literally brushing off the d irt or the dust on the person’s clothing that got there because of their fall. In a  more general way, in a more figurative way, we could say, “to dust someone off”  means to help someone back from a difficult situation or from a challenging si tuation – to help someone recover.  

“To give someone the boot” (boot) means to force so meone to leave an organization or to leave a place. A “boot” is somet hing you wear on your feet. It’s a kind of heavy shoe. Literally, “to give someone t he boot” would be to kick them in their behind – in their rear, in their butt – to  get them to leave the building. But it’s used, again, more figuratively to refer to get ting rid of someone, to forcing  

someone to leave a certain building or place. It co uld also refer to a company firing you, getting rid of you as an employee.  

But here Cassius refers to the situation in which B rittany might find herself if she goes into a church, mosque, or temple without permi ssion. They may kick her out of the house of worship. At least, I think that’s w hat Cassius is saying. He might be referring to the hypothetical, the imaginary sit uation in which Brittany Becomes a member of a church and invites people to come in and the other members of the congregation disagree with her and k ick her out of that church. I’m not sure.  

In any case, let’s listen to the dialogue now at a normal speed.
