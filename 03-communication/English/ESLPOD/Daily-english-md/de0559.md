This dialogue is about someone who is in a restaurant, and they want to leave the restaurant.  So it will describe common vocabulary and phrases you use when you are done eating and want to leave.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Server:  Can I clear these plates and get them out of your way?  Alvin:  Sure, we’re all done.  Can I get the rest of that in a doggie bag?  Server:  No problem.  I’ll wrap it up for you.  Is there anything else I can get you?  Did you leave room for dessert?  How about some coffee or tea?  Alvin:  No, I’m stuffed.  Just the check for me, thanks.  Server:  Sure, coming right up. …  Server:  Here’s your check.  I’ll take that when you’re ready.  Alvin:  Do you accept personal checks?  Server:  No, I’m afraid we don’t.  Alvin:  How about credit cards?  Server:  Yes, we do accept credit cards.  Alvin:  Here’s my Discover card.
