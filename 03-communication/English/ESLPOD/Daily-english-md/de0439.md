This episode is called “Talking About Censorship.”  It’s a  story about a parent who goes to a school, the school for their children, and  the parents have a meeting and they’re discussing what to do about certain b ooks that are in the school’s library or that the teachers are using.  This is of ten a problem in the U.S., some parents may not like the books that the childre n are being asked to read or that are available to them.  Let’s get starte d. > The school that my daughter attends is trying to decide w hether or not to ban certain books, which some parents think are inappropriate.   The school called a parents meeting to talk over the issue.
> At the meeting, one woman said: “The books on this list  are obscene!  I don’t want my children reading that filth!”
> Another parent responded: “That’s absurd!  Haven’t you e ver heard of free speech?  Banning books violates everything we Americans bel ieve in.”
> Another parent said: “I don’t like the way this book po rtrays history.  To me, it’s morally objectionable.”
> Still another parent complained: “There is too much g raphic violence in these books and I won’t allow my son to be exposed to it.”
> A parent stood up and yelled: “People who want to ban  books are fear mongering.  They don’t give our kids enough credit.”
> Our story is called “Talking About Censorship.”  “Censorshi p” means not allowing certain things to be seen or heard or published because y ou don’t like the ideas that are in that thing, or perhaps the visual images th at are part of that thing. Censorship usually is considered a negative thing, at lea st in American society, but of course, it all depends on who you talk to.

The story begins by saying that the school that my daughter  attends (my daughter goes to – is a student at) is trying to decide w hether or not to ban certain books.  “To ban” (ban) means not to allow somet hing to be used, bought, seen, or heard: “The university bans cigarette smoking in a ll of its buildings.” That means that it’s not allowed.  Most restaurants in m any cities in the U.S. have smoking bans; you cannot smoke there.  “To ban” can a lso mean not to allow certain books in the library or certain movies to b e shown in a city or town.

The meeting of the parents, then, is to discuss whether  they should ban certain books from the school – not allow them to be there.  O f course, all schools ban certain books that are, for example, considered pornogr aphic, or magazines that are not appropriate for young children.  So, it rea lly isn’t a question of banning or not banning, it’s deciding which things you’re going to ban.  Some parents think that there are books that are “inappropriate.”  This m eans they are not right for someone in a particular situation.  That could include b ooks that young children, for example, shouldn’t be reading because they’re not ri ght for their age.

The school called a parents meeting to talk over the issue , or to talk the issue over.  “To talk over” something is a phrasal verb meaning  to talk about something, to discuss something.  One woman said, “The bo oks on this list are obscene!”  Something that is “obscene” (obscene) means it is very offensive, it causes people to get angry or upset because it is dirty in a  sexual or a hateful way.  So, pornography, for example, showing sexual scenes of  men and women in certain cases could be considered by some people obscene.   The woman says, “I don’t want my children reading that filth!”  “F ilth” (filth) means dirt or garbage.  Here, it’s being used to say that something is very wrong; something is unclean or disgusting.  When a parent describes a book as being “filth,” they usually mean that it is sexually inappropriate for a give n student.

 Well, another parent said, “That’s absurd!”  Something  that is “absurd” is something that would be illogical – not logical, not rational, silly.  The parent says, “Haven’t you ever heard of free speech?”  “Free speech ,” in the United States, means the freedom or ability to say and write j ust about anything you want.  It’s part of our U.S. Constitution that people  have freedom of speech, or free speech.  The government tries not to limit free sp eech, although free speech is not absolute.  That is, there are cases where things ca nnot be said.  Schools, for example, do not give their students complete freedo m of speech.  This parent says, “Banning books violates everything we Americans believe in.”  “To violate,” here, means to go against something, to break a law or break a rule or break a principle, to go against our beliefs.  It goes against,  or violates, everything we Americans believe in.  “To believe in” means to think tha t something is good; you believe something is correct.

Another parent said, “I don’t like the way this book po rtrays history.”  “To portray” (portray), here, means to represent something, to expre ss something in a certain way; the way something is described or illustrated.  The p arent says, “To me, (this book) is morally objectionable.”  “Moral” refers t o right or wrong; “objectionable” is something that you don’t like, someth ing that you disagree with. So, something “morally objectionable” is something that a person doesn’t believe in, or goes against his or her beliefs of what is right  and wrong.

Another parent complained: “There’s too much graphic violence in these books.” “Graphic violence” is violence that is described or shown in  a lot of detail.  You don’t have to use your imagination; it’s described or sho wn in the book or in the movie.  This parent does not want her child “to be expos ed to it,” meaning to be allowed to see or hear something, not to be protected from something.  The verb “exposed” has a couple of different meanings; take a loo k at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  You’ll also find some  additional meanings of the verb “to ban,” which we talked about at the begin ning of this episode.

Another parent stood up and yelled: “People who want  to ban books are fear mongering.”  “To fear monger” means to use fear to ch ange people’s opinions about something; to frighten people to do something b y talking about the terrible things that will happen, things that they will find f earful, or will be afraid of.  “They don’t give our kids enough credit.”  Not to “give someo ne credit,” or “enough credit,” here means not to believe that someone is capabl e of doing something, or not to think that someone can do something.  If you r friend says to you, “Here, let me talk to that girl and ask her if she wants to go  on a date with you,” you

 might say, “Give me a little credit!” meaning you are n ot believing in my capabilities, you don’t think that I can do something bu t I can.

The story ends: The meeting turned into a shouting matc h.  A “shouting match” is a loud conversation that has people yelling at each other .  They’re trying to express their opinions, but it ends up being more people  yelling and not listening to each other.  So, a shouting match is usually a bad thi ng.  The story ends by the man saying that he’s glad the students, their childr en, were not there because the parents did not act like adults.  They started yelling at each other rather than talking about things in a reasonable way.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal spe ed.

[start of story]

The school that my daughter attends is trying to decide w hether or not to ban certain books, which some parents think are inappropriate.   The school called a parents meeting to talk over the issue.

At the meeting, one woman said: “The books on this list  are obscene!  I don’t want my children reading that filth!”

Another parent responded: “That’s absurd!  Haven’t you e ver heard of free speech?  Banning books violates everything we Americans bel ieve in.”

Another parent said: “I don’t like the way this book po rtrays history.  To me, it’s morally objectionable.”

Still another parent complained: “There is too much g raphic violence in these books and I won’t allow my son to be exposed to it.”

A parent stood up and yelled: “People who want to ban  books are fear mongering.  They don’t give our kids enough credit.”

The meeting turned into a shouting match.  If you ask m e, I’m very glad that none of the students were at this meeting.  They would be le arning an important lesson, but not one that any parent would want!
