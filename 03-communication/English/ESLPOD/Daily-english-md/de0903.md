Our story begins when I say that every afternoon be fore I leave work, before I leave my job, I listen to the traffic report. The “ traffic report” is information about

how fast cars are moving on different streets and f reeways. Usually, people listen to the traffic report on the radio in their car. Th ey turn on the radio and there are certain radio stations that frequently give you a t raffic report. Here in Los Angeles, because traffic is always so bad, because we have so many cars, there are a couple of stations that give traffic reports every five to 10 minutes throughout the entire day. So, within five or 10 mi nutes of getting in your car, you can hear what the road conditions are. That is how much traffic there is on the road.

I said that, “I listen to the traffic report to see  if I should take my usual route home” – my usual way of going from my office to my home – “or make a detour.” A “detour” (detour) is when you go a different way than you would normally go, either because there are problems on the road – the re's a lot of traffic, for example – or because the road is closed due to cons truction, because they're fixing or building it. You can't drive on it, so yo u have to take a detour. You have to take another road that will get you to the same place although, usually, it will take longer. I say that “Today, like every day, I t urned on my radio.”

Next, we hear the voice of the person who is giving  the traffic report. I've always wanted to be the person on the radio giving the tra ffic report. Maybe someday I will be able to get that job. It's kind of an inter esting job here in Los Angeles because the traffic reporters – the people who tell  you how the traffic is doing – often are in helicopters and they’re flying around the city looking down at the freeways and the streets to see how the traffic is doing, whether it is crowded or not. So, it's kind of an exciting job, at least her e in Los Angeles.

The traffic reporter says, “It's a tough” – or diff icult – “commute today if you're traveling on I-35 North.” Your “commute” (commute) is the trip between your home and your office, and your office and your home . That time traveling, that act of traveling, typically in a car, is what we ca ll your “commute.” “It's a tough commute,” the announcer, the reporter says, “if you 're traveling” – if you are going on – “I-35 North.” The “I” stands for “inters tate.” In the United States, we have the most important, the largest highways and f reeways as part of something called the interstate highway system. I-35 North wo uld be a freeway that I just happen to know, runs in the middle of the United St ates through my home state of Minnesota. I-35 North would be the people who we re traveling north on that road.

The traffic announcer says there is a major, or a v ery serious – important – slowdown. A “slowdown” – one word – is a situation where the cars are slowing down but they're not stopped completely. They're st ill moving, but they're going more slowly than they normally would. I say there i s a major slowdown due to, or

because of, an overturned big rig. “To overturn som ething” is to flip it over, to make the bottom be facing the top, and the top faci ng the bottom. “Overturned,” when used in describing a car or a vehicle, means t he car or the truck has turned over, and now it is upside down. A “big rig” (rig) is a large truck. It's an informal word we use to describe a very large truck that wou ld, for example, carry things from one city to another. It’s a very long truck. I f the big rig overturned, that would be very serious because, of course, it's a very big  truck and it probably would cause problems for people trying to drive on the ro ad. In fact, this big rig is blocking the number two lane.

“To block” (block) means not allow someone access, not allow someone to go through a certain area. If the truck is blocking tr affic, it's preventing other cars from driving through that area. The truck is blocki ng the number two lane. A “lane” (lane) is the area on a freeway or a road wh ere the car drives. Some freeways, most freeways, have more than one lane go ing in each direction so you can have two cars traveling side-by-side, next to each other, going in the same direction. In Los Angeles, some of our freeway s have four, five or even six lanes of cars – six lines of cars – going in the sa me direction. In many cities, at least here in Los Angeles, the traffic reporters wi ll number the lanes so you'll know which lane they’re talking about. The number o ne lane is the lane that is farthest to the left as you drive down the freeway.  That's the lane where people go fast. So, if you don't want to go fast, you shou ld not be in the number one lane. The number two lane, then, would be the lane next to the number one lane, to the right of the number one lane, and then, of c ourse, number three, number four, and so forth, depending on their position on the freeway. So, this overturned big rig is blocking the number two lane. It's block ing part of the freeway.

I then say, “Oh no. That meant that I had to take t he 40W instead.” I had to take another freeway. But then we hear the traffic repor ter again telling us about the problems on the other freeway, on the 40W. He says,  “If you're traveling on the 40W, you'll find a lot of congestion.” “Congestion”  is traffic that's moving very slowly, cars that are moving very slowly. The repor ters says that “its” – meaning the freeway – “it's down to one lane because of a p ileup.” “To be down to,” means that it has been reduced to. It has been lowe red to that number. You might say, if you only have one dollar left in your  pocket, “I'm down to one dollar,” meaning the amount of money I have has been reduced  to one dollar. I spent all the rest of it buying coffee at Starbucks, or where ver. The freeway is down to one lane because of a “pileup.” A “pileup” (pileup) – o ne word – is a crash involving more than two cars or more than two vehicles. A pil eup would be three or more cars that have hit each other on the freeway or on a road somewhere, and are blocking other people from driving by, or at least that's what typically happens.

The traffic reporter says that, “Emergency vehicles  are responding.” “Emergency vehicles” refers to a police car, an ambulance – for people who are injured – or a fire truck, if there's a fire. All of those are eme rgency vehicles – a police car, an ambulance, or fire truck. When we say the emergency  vehicles are responding, we mean they're actually going to the scene, the pl ace where the accident is, in order to help. We talk about responders being peopl e who, in an emergency, are the first to go and help – the police men and women , the firemen and women, and so forth.

I then say, “Wow. That meant I might have to take s urface streets all the way home.” Because the two freeways are congested, I say that I might have to take surface streets. “Surface (surface) streets” are an y roads, any boulevards, any streets in a city, not including freeways, highways , and expressways. Those three words all mean the same thing, really. “Surfa ce streets” is anything but the freeway. It's all of the other streets, not includi ng the freeway or the highway.

The traffic report’s final announcement is that, “I f you're thinking of taking,” of driving on, “Broadway Boulevard west of downtown, t hink again,” meaning you should reconsider your plans. You should come up wi th a better idea – “think again.” “There is a stalled vehicle blocking the ri ght lane.” “Stalled” (stalled) is an adjective we use to describe a car that won't move because of some mechanical problem. That's a stalled car. In this case, there is a stalled vehicle, which is just a more general word for car or a truck, blocking the right lane and construction all the way to Main Street. “Construction” here means t hey are building a new road or fixing the road and you can't drive on it.

“Well,” I said, “I was in a no-win situation.” A “n o-win situation” is a situation where no matter what happens, it's going to be bad.  It's a situation where regardless of the decision you make, something bad will happen. I say, “Do I want to spend two hours in gridlock or two more hou rs at work?” “Gridlock” (gridlock) is a situation where there are so many c ars that nobody can move or it seems like nobody can move. The cars are all stoppe d because there are too many cars on the road. That's “gridlock.” If I go h ome now, I'm going to be on the road for two hours before I get home. The other opt ion is to stay at work and work later waiting for the traffic to die down, to reduce, to be less of a problem. Neither of those are very good options for me, and that's why I say, “This is a no- win situation.”

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

Every afternoon before I leave work, I listen to the traffic report to see if I should take my usual route home or make a detour.  So toda y, like every day, I turned on my radio.

“It’s a tough commute today if you’re traveling on I-35 north.  There’s a major slowdown due to an overturned big rig that’s blocki ng the number two lane.”

Oh no.  That meant that I had to take the 40W inste ad.

“If you’re traveling on the 40W, you’ll find a lot of congestion. It’s down to one lane because of a pileup.  Emergency vehicles are r esponding.”

Wow, that meant I might have to take surface street s all the way home.

“And if you’re thinking of taking Broadway Boulevar d west from downtown, think again.  There is a stalled vehicle blocking the rig ht lane and construction all the way to Main Street.”

Well, I was in a no-win situation.  Do I want to sp end two hours in gridlock or two more hours at work?

[end of story]

She builds freeways to better English that are neve r congested, never blocked. I speak poetically of our very own Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.
