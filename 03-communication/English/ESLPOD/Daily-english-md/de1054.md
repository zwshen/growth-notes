This episode is a dialogue between Carlos and Inez about finding someone to be your roommate. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carlos: Now that your boyfriend has moved out, you need a roommate. There’s no way you can afford this apartment on your own.

Inez: I know, but I really don’t want to live with a stranger. I’d have to put up with all of their quirks.

Carlos: I don’t think you have a choice. You need s omeone to split the rent and the cost of utilities, not to mention your cable bi ll.

Inez: I’d need someone who could keep the common ar eas neat and clean and who can keep their hands off my stuff.

Carlos: I’m sure you’ll manage to find someone with  those qualities.

Inez: They’d have to help with chores around the ap artment, too, and pitch in with general upkeep.

Carlos: No doubt there’s someone out there who woul dn’t mind doing that.

Inez: Hey, aren’t you looking for a place to live? You could move in here.

Carlos: You mean share an apartment with you? No th anks.

Inez: Why not?

Carlos: I’d just rather not. I don’t think we’d sui t.

Inez: Why wouldn’t we?

Carlos: Do you really want me to spell it out for y ou?

Inez: Yes, in fact, I insist.

Carlos: All right. Let’s just say that you’re a lit tle bit grouchy in the mornings. You know that monster in the Alien  movies?

Inez: Yes.

[silence]

Carlos: Ouch! Ouch! Stop hitting me!

Our dialogue begins with Carlos and Inez talking ab out getting a new roommate. Carlos says that Inez’s old roommate – her boyfrien d, apparently – has moved out. “To move out” means to leave the place where y ou are living and go somewhere else, go somewhere else to live. Inez is correcting her first mistake, which was to move in with her boyfriend.

Now she needs to find a “roommate” (roommate). A “r oommate” is a person you live with, but someone with whom you don’t have any  romantic connection. Usually a roommate is a friend or another person wh o helps you pay for the rent and the expenses of your house or apartment. Carlos  says, “There’s no way you can afford this apartment on your own.” “To afford”  (afford) means to be able to pay for something, to have enough money to pay for something.

Inez says, “I know, but I really don’t want to live  with a stranger.” A “stranger” (stranger) is anyone you don’t know, anyone who is unknown to you – a person you may see on the street or in a store. If you don ’t know them, they are strangers. Inez says, “I have to put up with all of  their quirks.” “To put up with” something is to tolerate something, especially some thing that is difficult or unpleasant. To put up with a person or a situation is to have to get along with the person or to handle the situation even though it is n’t very pleasant, isn’t very nice.

Inez doesn’t want to put up with a stranger’s “quir ks” (quirks). A quirk is an unusual behavior or habit – something someone does that is uncommon and not usually done by most people. All of us have quirks,  things that we do that are different than most people. Carlos says, “I don’t t hink you have a choice. You need someone to split the rent and the cost of util ities, not to mention your cable bill.” “To split” (split) means to share – often, t o divide something into two equal parts.

If you are splitting the bill at a restaurant, each  of you is going to pay 50 percent of the bill. That’s normally how it works, but you could have a split that was 70 percent/30 percent. Carlos says Inez needs a roomma te “to split the rent.” The “rent” (rent) is the amount of money you pay to liv e in your home or in your apartment if you don’t own it. “Utilities” (utiliti es) is a general term referring to the electricity, the water, the gas, and other services  that are delivered to a home or business so that you can live or work there. These things are referred to in general as “utilities.”

Carlos also mentions Inez’s cable bill. Your “cable  (cable) bill” is the amount of money you have to pay in order to get cable televis ion into your home. Some people have satellite television as well, or instea d of cable television, usually. In either case, it’s an extra expense – more money you  have to pay every month.

Inez says, “I’d need someone who could keep the com mon areas neat and clean, and who can keep their hands off my stuff.” The “co mmon areas” in an apartment or a building are the areas that are shared with ot her people, that other people use. It’s often the case that two people who are ro ommates in an apartment will have their own bedrooms. However, the kitchen and t he living room are shared or common areas – areas both of them use.

Inez is worried about getting a roommate who is nea t and clean. “Neat” means orderly. “Tidy” (tidy), we might also say. “Clean” means the opposite of dirty. Inez wants someone who can also keep his hands off her s tuff. “To keep your hands off” someone’s things means to not touch it, especi ally something that is private, something that belongs to another person. “Keep you r hands off of my wallet” – don’t touch my wallet. It doesn’t belong to you – u nless you’re my wife, in which case everything belongs to you.

Carlos says, “I’m sure you’ll manage” – you’ll be a ble – “to find someone with those qualities,” with those characteristics. Inez says, “They’d have to help with chores around the apartment, too, and pitch in with  general upkeep.” “Chores” (chores) are tasks – things you have to do, usually  involving cleaning in a house.

There are lots of different chores, different thing s you have to do in your house in order to keep it clean. You have to wash the dishes , for example. You have to take out the garbage. Take your trash and leave it somewhere so it can be picked up. These are all chores. The word “chore” i s often used to describe an unpleasant task. I guess since most people think th at keeping their house clean isn’t a lot of fun.

Inez wants someone to “pitch in with general upkeep .” “To pitch in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to help with something, to con tribute by doing something. “I want everyone to pitch in and help me clean my r oom.” You’re asking other people to work with you, to help you. You can also use “pitch in” in a financial sense. “We’re all going to pitch in and buy our bos s a birthday present.” We’re all going to give money in order to buy the gift.

Inez wants someone to pitch in with the “general up keep.” “Upkeep” (upkeep) – one word – is another term for maintenance. Upkeep involves keeping things clean and in good condition. If they break, you fix  them. Usually the word “upkeep” is applied to some sort of property, such as a house or an apartment building. Carlos says, “No doubt there’s someone ou t there who wouldn’t mind doing that.” Carlos thinks that Inez can find a roo mmate like what she’s looking for. Inez says, “Hey, aren’t you looking for a plac e to live? You could move in here.” Inez is inviting Carlos to be her roommate.

Carlos says, “You mean share an apartment with you?  No, thanks.” Carlos is not interested. Inez says, “Why not?” Carlos says, “I’d  just rather not.” When you don’t want to give the reason why you don’t want to  do something – usually because you think the other person will get mad at you or will be offended – you can say something like, “I’d rather not.” “I’d just  rather not,” Carlos says. “I don’t think we’d suit.” “To suit” (suit) in this case mea ns to be appropriate for someone or something – to meet the requirements or needs of  someone.

Inez says, “Why wouldn’t we?” meaning “Why wouldn’t  we be suited for each other?” we could say. Carlos says, “Do you really w ant me to spell it out for you?” “To spell” (spell) normally means to give the lette rs of the words, like I do here on the podcast. “To spell it out,” however, means to s ay something explicitly and directly – to give a lot of details so there’s no p ossibility of the person misunderstanding you.

Carlos doesn’t want to give Inez a list of reasons why he should not be her roommate. He doesn’t want to offend her. He doesn’t  want to make her upset. That’s why he says, “Do you really want me to spell  it out for you?” Inez says,

“Yes, in fact, I insist.” “To insist” (insist) mean s to demand that something happen, to not accept any other alternatives.

Carlos then says, “All right. Let me just say that you’re a little bit grouchy in the mornings.” “To be grouchy” (grouchy) means to be in  a bad mood, to be unpleasant, often because you’re tired or you’ve ha d a bad day or perhaps you didn’t sleep well, if you’re grouchy in the morning . “You know that monster in the Alien  movies?” Carlos is asking Inez if she remembers the series of movies about an outer space monster, an outer space creatu re. Inez says, “Yes.”

And then Carlos says, “Ouch, ouch! Stop hitting me! ” What happened here, of course, is Inez is hitting Carlos because she’s ang ry at him. She feels insulted. But to be fair to Carlos, she did ask for him to sp ell it out, to give her the exact reasons why she would not be a good roommate for hi m.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
