This episode is called “Finding Love on Valentine’s  Day.”  It’s a dialogue between Tony and Chelsea about finding love on Valentine’s Day.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Tony:  Another Valentine’s Day!  I really hate Vale ntine’s Day.   

Chelsea:  What’s your problem?   

Tony:  I’m sick of seeing heart-shaped boxes, stuff ed animals, and cupid decorations everywhere.  Lovey-dovey couples on the  street and nothing but sentimental movies on TV – that’s what I have a pro blem with.   

Chelsea:  You’re just jaded because you don’t have a valentine on Valentine’s Day. 

Tony:  Do you blame me?  This is the third year I’m  spending Valentine’s Day alone.  That’s enough to make any man feel jaded.   

Chelsea:  There are plenty of women you could go ou t with.  Just open your eyes and look around. 

Tony:  All of the women I know are either psycho or  attached.  I’ve given up on dating.   

Chelsea:  How will you find a Miss Right with an at titude like that? 

Tony:  I’ve told you.  I’ve given up. 

Chelsea:  Well, I think you should open your eyes.  Your valentine may be right under your nose!

Tony is friends with Chelsea, and Tony has a proble m.  He says, “Another Valentine’s Day!”  Valentine’s Day, also known as S aint Valentine’s Day, is traditionally a day that celebrates love and affect ion, especially romantic love. Tony says, “I really hate Valentine’s Day.”  Chelse a says, “What’s your problem?” meaning what’s wrong, why are you so strange.  Depe nding on the intonation, the way you pronounce that phrase, it could be cons idered a criticism.  If somebody says, “What’s your problem man?” they’re i ndicating that you are acting strange or unusual, and perhaps you should b e careful that you could get hurt.  But here, Chelsea is just saying what’s the matter, what is the situation, why do you hate Valentine’s Day.   

Tony says, “I’m sick of seeing heart-shaped boxes.”   “To be sick of (something)” means that you are tired of it; you no longer want to, in this case, see heart- shaped boxes, stuffed animals, and cupid decoration s everywhere.  “Heart- shaped” means made in the shape or the form of a he art; of course, that symbolizes love traditionally.  “Stuffed animals” a re small – usually small, they can be big – toys that are in the shape of an anima l, and they’re very soft. They’re often given to young children, however some  men give them to their girlfriends or wives as a romantic gesture.  “Cupid  decorations” refers to the Roman god Cupid, who was the son of Venus and Mars.   In Latin, the word “cupido” means desire, as in sexual, romantic desir e.  That’s what’s the idea behind the cupid decorations.  Traditionally, Cupid  is shown in art as a small boy who has a bow and arrows.  An “arrow” is a long, th in piece of wood that is sharp at one end, and you use the “bow” to shoot the arro ws into the hearts of poor humans, who then fall in love.  There was a great s ong by I think it was Sam Cooke: “Cupid pull back your bow and let your arrow  go straight to my lover’s heart for me.”  It’s better when Sam sings it!   

On Valentine’s Day you will often see “decorations, ” things that people put up to make somewhere look different.  For example, at Chr istmas you put up a tree and you may put up lights around your house.  These  would be Christmas decorations.  Tony doesn’t like any of this; he say s he doesn’t like seeing lovey- dovey couples on the street and nothing but sentime ntal movies on TV.  “Lovey- dovey” is sort of an informal way of saying two peo ple who love each other very much and often show that love in public.  They’re k issing each other and they’re holding hands and they’re hugging each other.  You know, the sort of things that girls usually love and guys don’t.  Well, that’s a lovey-dovey couple, and Tony  

says he has a problem with that; he doesn’t like th at.  He also doesn’t like sentimental movies.  Something that is “sentimental ” has a lot of emotions, a lot of feelings.  Usually it’s used somewhat as a criti cism; you’re saying it’s too emotional, there’s too much obvious emotion or feel ings expressed in the movie or the song, whatever it happens to be. 

You may wonder why Tony hates Valentine’s Day so mu ch, and Chelsea tells us in the next sentence.  She says, “You’re just jaded  because you don’t have a valentine on Valentine’s Day.”  “To be jaded” (jade d) means that you are no longer excited by or interested in something that s eems to interest everyone else. Usually this is because you have had a lot of expos ure – you have a lot of experience with that thing.  This is perhaps not qu ite the case for Tony, even though Chelsea says he’s jaded.  I’m not sure if th at is exactly his situation, but in any case, he certainly is upset or unhappy because he doesn’t have a valentine on Valentine’s Day.  A “valentine” (with a small “v ”) is used as a noun to mean a romantic partner, someone you are involved with: yo ur boyfriend or girlfriend, your husband or wife.  Those would be your valentin es.  Well, you should only really have one valentine, at least one at a time! 

Tony says, “Do you blame me?” meaning are you sayin g that it is my fault, do think that I am the one who is responsible for this  situation.  “To blame” (blame) someone is to say that they did something wrong.  W e use this expression to show that we feel that we are rational, logical, th at we are justified in saying the things we are saying.  Tony says, “This is the thir d year I’m spending Valentine’s Day alone.  That’s enough to make any man feel jade d.”  Again, we often use this word when you have too much exposure to a situ ation; Tony seems to have not very much exposure.  But it can sometimes be us ed just to mean bored or uninterested in something.  Tony is unhappy because  he doesn’t have a valentine, and has not had one for three years.   

Chelsea says, “There are plenty of women you could go out with.”  “To go out with,” in this case, means to date, to have a roman tic relationship with, to make your boyfriend or girlfriend.  “Just open your eyes  and look around,” she says. Now Tony – you have to understand not too smart, ok ay – doesn’t really understand what Chelsea’s saying to him.  Chelsea s ays, “Just open your eyes and look around.”   

Tony says, “All of the women I know are either psyc ho or attached.”  “Psycho” is an informal word meaning crazy, someone with a lot of mental or intellectual problems, someone who doesn’t act rationally.  If y ou are “attached” in this case it means that you have a strong connection with som eone else.  Really, it means that these women already have boyfriends; those are  the only women he knows.   

He says, “I’ve given up on dating.”  I should menti on that “attached” has some other meanings as well, and those are in our wonder ful Learning Guide.  So, Tony says he has given up on dating.  “To give up” is a two-word phrasal verb, which means in this case to stop doing something us ually because you have not been very successful; you have failed many times.  “I’m going to give up cooking, because I’m not very good at it.”  True story!   

Chelsea says, “How will you find a Miss Right with an attitude like that?”  This is kind of a play on words; that is, Chelsea is sort o f using a traditional expression, “Mr. Right,” and using the feminine – the female “M iss.”  Normally we talk about a woman meeting “Mr. Right,” meaning the perfect husb and, the perfect man to be her husband.  Chelsea says that Tony can meet Miss Right, the perfect woman. Again, that’s not the normal use of it, but she’s s ort of playing with that.  She says, “How will you find a Miss Right with an attit ude like that (with the way that you are acting)?”  Tony says, “I’ve told you.  I’ve  given up.”  Chelsea says, “Well, I think you should open your eyes.  Your valentine may be right under your nose!”  Something that is “right under your nose” m eans that it is easily available. It is, in fact, very close to you, but you don’t se e it, you don’t notice it, and obviously Tony doesn’t realize that Chelsea is not just his friend, Chelsea perhaps wants to be his valentine and Tony is just too much of a man to understand reality.  Isn’t that true ladies? 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
