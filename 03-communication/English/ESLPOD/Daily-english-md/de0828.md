Kelly begins our dialog by saying to John, “What we  need” – the thing we need – “What we need are a few people in the industry to t alk up our new company.” The “industry” (industry) could refer to any group of businesses that works in the same area. You could talk about the car manufacturi ng industry or the coal industry or the nuclear power industry or the podca st industry – any collection of companies, any area of business activity can be cal led an industry. Here in Los Angeles, however, when you say “the Industry,” you’ re usually referring to the entertainment industry – movie companies, televisio n studios, and so forth. People say, “Oh, yeah. He works in the Industry” – they mean he works in some connection to one of the entertainment companies he re in Hollywood.

Kelly says they need a few people in the industry t o “talk up” their new company. “To talk up” is a phrasal verb meaning to say good things about someone or something so that other people have a good opinion of it. “I’m going to talk up this new restaurant. It’s really great. I think you  should try it.” I’m saying good things about it to get other people to notice it, t o go there.

John says, “I’m on top of that.” The phrase “to be on top of something” means that you are actually and actively doing something,  that you don’t need any help from anyone else, that you have it – we might say –  “under control.” “I’m taking care of that” is what John is saying. He says, “I’m  really well connected.” “To be well connected” means that you have relationships w ith very important, powerful, influential people in your area. If someone says, “ Yeah, I’m very well connected in the Industry here in Los Angeles” – that would m ean they know famous movie stars or famous producers or directors. I, for exam ple, am not well connected in any industry.

John says, however, “I’m really well connected, as you know, and I’ve already put in a few calls to a few of the movers and shake rs in our business.” “To put in a few calls” means that you have telephoned a few p eople. You have made a couple of phone calls. “I’ve put in a few calls,” J ohn says, “to a few of” – some, a couple – “a few of the movers and shakers in our in dustry.” The expression “movers and shakers” (shakers) means people who are  very powerful, people who are very influential, people who make big impor tant decisions about something in your particular area.

Kelly says, “I didn’t know you had such a vast netw ork of contacts. “Vast” (vast) means very large, something that has a lot of diffe rent items or things in it. We might talk about the universe as being “vast” –it’s  huge, it’s really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really big – really  big – that’s vast. John says he has a “vast network.” A “network” (network) – one word – is a group of people who are connected to each other, usually, people who have s ome sort of common or

professional interest. I might have a network of pe ople who are language teachers – I don’t but I could – and if I did, that  would be a “network.”

“Contacts” (contacts) is in the title of this episo de – “Important Business Contacts.” “Contacts” are people with whom you have  some sort of professional relationship and can call on for advice. “I have “c ontacts” in the entertainment industry” – that means I know people. So, contacts,  really are people, but usually we use that word in talking about people who you ha ve some professional association with. However, contacts can also be use d to describe just anyone you know who’s telephone or address you have. Many phones – smart phones, computers – have software programs and part of the program or part of the software, I should say, often has a contact program  and the contacts are the people you know – their email addresses, their phon e numbers, etc. So, Kelly says, “I didn’t know you had such a vast network of  contacts.” John says, “Oh, sure I do. I don’t mean to name drop but you know K evin Martinez at McQ Corp? I’m pretty tight with him.” “To name drop” means to  mention the name of some important or famous person in a conversation so tha t the other person is impressed. They go, “Oh, wow. You know that person? ” For example, “Last night, I was having dinner with Brad Pitt and his w ife, Angelina Jolie, and I was telling them about ESL Podcast.” That would be an e xample of name dropping. I’m mentioning a famous person so that you will go,  “Oh, wow. You know Brad Pitt?” Well, that’s what the women would ask me. the men would ask me if I knew Angelina Jolie.

John says that he knows this famous person, Kevin M artinez. He says, “I’m pretty tight with him.” “To be tight (tight) with s omeone” means to have a very close relationship with them, to be friends with th em. John says, “And Eva Arribas at Syntect? She and I go way back.” The exp ression “to go way back” means that you’ve known them for a very long time. You’ve had a relationship with them, usually a professional relationship, wit h a person for a very long time. That’s what he means when he says, “She and I go wa y back.” Kelly says, “Wow. Those are some heavy hitters.” The expression “heav y hitter” (hitter) is similar to “movers and shakers.” “Heavy hitters” are people wh o have a lot of power, a lot of influence in a certain area.

John says, “You’ve said it.” That phrase, “You’ve s aid it” is use to show agreement with what the other person has just said.  We might also say, “Exactly!” or “Precisely!” So your friend says, “Th is is a delicious meal. This food tastes very good.” And you respond, “You’ve said it !” or “Exactly!” or “Precisely!” It means I agree with you completely. John says, “A nd Kevin owes me one. And Eva would bend over backwards for me.” “To owe (owe ) someone” means you owe that person a favor. You need to do something f or that person because they

did something for you. Well, John has done somethin g for Kevin, we don’t know what, but now Kevin has to do something for John.

This is a very powerful, social force of influence,  of course, what we call “reciprocity.” When I do something for you, then yo u do something for me. John also says that Eva would “bend over backwards” for him. “To bend (bend) over backwards (backwards)” means to do something, more than you might expect, especially when it’s difficult or uncomfortable. We  might say it’s to make an extreme effort, to do everything you possibly can f or this other person – to “bend over backwards.” Kelly says, “It’s great! What did they say when you asked them to get the word about us?” The expression “to get t he word out” – means to inform other people about something, to tell other people about something that is happening, something that is going on, to make sure  other people know about it.

Kelly is asking what these heavy hitters said to Jo hn. John says, “Um, I’m still waiting to hear back from them,” meaning they haven ’t returned his phone calls, they haven’t called him back. “I’m sure they’ll cal l back any day now.” The expression “any day now” means soon but you’re not exactly sure when. You think it will happen soon but you’re not sure. So, John has all these heavy hitting friends but they don’t call him back – maybe they’r e not really friends.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
