On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Mom and Sa’ad about changing the size of your clothing. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Mom: Put on these pants and this shirt, come over h ere, and stand still. I need to alter your brother’s clothes to fit you.

Sa’ad: Oh, Mom!

Mom: Hurry up. I need to let down the hems and take  up the sleeves. I don’t think I have to take in the pant legs, but I might have to let out the waist a little.

Sa’ad: Ouch!

Mom: Sorry, but you need to stop moving around or y our hem will be uneven and your seams will be crooked. You and your brothers a re growing so fast I feel like a full-time tailor!

Sa’ad: Are we done?

Mom: No, we’re not. Stay right there. You can help me iron a crease into this shirt before I put it through the sewing machine.

Sa’ad: Oh, Mom!

Mom: Don’t “Oh, Mom” me. This machine doesn’t seem to be working. I hope I don’t have to stitch all these by hand.

Sa’ad: Mom, since I’m growing so fast, I’ll probabl y grow out of these clothes in a couple of months. Let’s wait until after my growth spurt to alter them.

Mom: And what will you wear in the meantime, high w aters?

Sa’ad: No, shorts!

[end of dialogue]

We have in this dialogue a mother and her son. The mother says to her son, “Put on these pants and this shirt, come over here, and stand still.” The mother is telling the son to put on a pair of pants and a shi rt and then to walk over to her and stand still. “Stand still” means don’t move. Do n’t move your arms or your legs or any part of your body. The mother says, “I need to alter your brother’s clothes to fit you.” The mother is going “to alter” some cl othing. “To alter” (alter) means to change or modify something, especially when we are referring to clothing.

You alter clothing so that it “fits” (fits) you bet ter. It is the correct size for you. “To fit” means to be the correct size for you, when ref erring to clothing. Mom wants to alter the brother’s clothing to fit her son, Sa’ad.  The son says, “Oh, Mom!” He says it in a way that indicates he’s complaining. H e doesn’t like what his mother is doing. The mother, however, says, “Hurry up. in eed to let down the hems and take up the sleeves.” “To let (let) down” in this c ase means to increase the length of something, such as the length of the pants.

“Pants” are, of course, articles of clothing that y ou wear over your legs. If a pair of pants are too short, sometimes you can “let down  the hem” (hem) of the pants. The “hem” is the bottom of the pants, which often h as more material, more of the pant leg underneath. If you take out the “hem,” the  sewing that is on the bottom of the pant leg, there is often more material that can be pulled down to make the pants longer. That’s what Mom is doing in our dialo gue. She’s going to let down the hems. She also is going “to take up the sleeves .”

The phrasal verb “to take up” is the opposite of the phrasal verb “to let down” when we’re talking about clothing. “To take up” mea ns to shorten something, to decrease the length of something – in this case, Mo m wants to “take up the sleeves” (sleeves). The sleeves are the parts of a shirt that go over the arms. If you put on a shirt that is too big for you, the sle eves might be so long they go over your hands. In that case, you would need to ta ke up the sleeves. You would need to shorten them. Mom wants to take up the slee ves in Sa’ad’s brother’s clothes so that they fit him.

She says, “I don’t think I have to take in the pant  legs, but I may have to let out the waist a little.” There are two more phrasal ver bs that Mom uses here in talking about altering clothing. They are “to take in” and “to let out.” “To take in” means to make something smaller around, especially when we’re talking about the waist of pants or of a skirt. If you, for examp le, lose weight and you are now skinnier, your pants will be a little loose around the middle of your body, around your waist. You might have to take in your pants – that is, you might have to change them so that the waist is smaller.

Let’s hope that is a problem you have. For many peo ple, however, if you gain weight, if you get fatter, you might have “to let o ut” the waist of the pants. “To let (let) out” means to make the waist bigger. Sometime s it’s not possible to let out the waist of a pair of pants. Sometimes you just ha ve to buy a new, bigger pair of pants. Mom doesn’t think she’ll need to take in the  legs of the pants. She doesn’t think she’ll need to make the pant legs smaller, bu t she might have “to let out the waist a little” for her younger son.

Sa’ad says, “Ouch!” “Ouch” is the word we use when we are expressing pain, if someone hurts us. We may say, “Ouch!” (ouch). Mom s ays, “Sorry, but you need to stop moving around or your hem will be uneven an d your seams will be crooked.” “To be uneven” (uneven) means to be not s traight. “To be uneven” is the opposite of “to be even,” which is straight. Yo u want the bottom of your pants, the hems of your pants, to be even, not uneven.

Another word for “uneven” is “crooked” (crooked). S omething that is “crooked” is something that is not in a straight line, something  that is not even. There’s another meaning of the word “crooked,” which is to be someone who is dishonest, who takes money illegally. Many politici ans around the world are “crooked.” They are dishonest by taking money and d oing things because someone gave them money. Here, however, “crooked” j ust means not straight, not even.

Mom is worried that because her son keeps moving ar ound while she’s trying to measure and make alterations of the clothing, the s eams of the clothing will be “crooked.” “Seams” (seams) refers to the line of se wing where two pieces of the material, what we call “fabric” (fabric), come toge ther in a piece of clothing. So, if you look at a pair of pants, if you look at the leg s of the pants, there will be a “seam” – a place where the material or the fabric is sewn together, is connected. That’s called a “seam.”

Mom says, “You and your brothers are growing so fas t I feel like a full-time tailor.” A “tailor” (tailor) is a person who sews clothing p rofessionally, who gets paid to

sew clothing. A tailor is often a person who makes clothing as well. For example, if you want to buy a nice professional suit – a sui t coat and pants – you might go to a tailor and have a suit made professionally tha t will cost you a lot of money. You might go to a tailor just to have your clothes altered – just to have them changed so that they will fit better.

A “tailor,” then, is someone who works and gets pai d for doing the kinds of things that Mom is doing for free in our dialogue and many  moms have done for free, including my own. The son says, “Are we done?” Mom says, “No, we’re not,” meaning “We are not finished.” “Stay right there. y ou can help me iron a crease into this shirt before I put it through the sewing machine.” A “crease” (crease) is a line in clothing that is made by using what’s calle d an “iron” (iron). An iron is a hot piece of metal that you put over clothing so that the clothing is flat.

Sometimes, especially for a pair of formal pants, y ou want a crease in the pants. You want a line that you can see in the fabric. Mom  is going to have Sa’ad do a crease in the shirt. She wants him to do this befor e she puts the shirt “through the sewing machine.” The “sewing (sewing) machine” is a machine that sews or puts two pieces of fabric together with something c alled “thread” (thread). “Thread” is like a very thin piece of string that y ou would use in clothing in order to put two pieces of fabric or material together.

Once again the son goes, “Oh, Mom!” He’s complainin g again. Mom says, “Don’t ‘Oh, Mom’ me,” meaning don’t say that to me. Don’t complain to me. “This machine doesn’t seem to be working,” Mom says. “I h ope I don’t have to stitch all these by hand.” “To stitch” (stitch) means to conne ct two pieces of fabric or material by putting the thread into the material in  the form of a circle. You typically take a sharp metal object called a “needl e” and you put it into the material with a piece of thread tied onto it, and y ou take the needle and pull it in and out of the material, forming little circles.

That’s “stitching” the material or the fabric toget her. Mom says she’s going to have “to stitch” all of these “by hand.” “By hand” means using her own hands, not using the sewing machine. Sa’ad says, “Mom, since I ’m growing so fast, I’ll probably grow out of these clothes in a couple of m onths.” “To grow out of clothes” means to get bigger so that you will no lo nger be able to wear a certain piece of clothing. When children grow up, they “gro w out of” the clothing they have and have to get new, bigger clothing.

The son is saying that he’s growing so fast that he ’s going to grow out of the clothes that Mom is working on right now in a coupl e of months. He says, “Let’s wait until after my growth spurt to alter them.” the term “growth spurt” (spurt)

refers to a period of time when a child grows very quickly. Even in a few months, the child gets taller or bigger. Sa’ad is saying th at Mom should wait and not alter these clothes right now, and instead alter them aft er he has another growth spurt.

Mom says, “And what will you wear in the meantime?”  meaning what will you wear between now and the end of your next growth sp urt. She says, “And what will you wear in the meantime, high waters?” “High waters” (high waters) are pants that are too short for you, pants that end se veral inches above the ankle. They’re called “high waters” because, of course, if  you were walking to the street and there was a lot of water in the street, your pa nts wouldn’t get wet because they are so high up on your legs.

Her son isn’t proposing to wear the pants as high w aters. He says, “No, shorts!” meaning he wants his mother to make the pants into a pair of shorts.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mom: Put on these pants and this shirt, come over h ere, and stand still. I need to alter your brother’s clothes to fit you.

Sa’ad: Oh, Mom!

Mom: Hurry up. I need to let down the hems and take  up the sleeves. I don’t think I have to take in the pant legs, but I might have to let out the waist a little.

Sa’ad: Ouch!

Mom: Sorry, but you need to stop moving around or y our hem will be uneven and your seams will be crooked. You and your brothers a re growing so fast I feel like a full-time tailor!
