[Start of story]  

I admit it.  I’m a player.  I work in an office where there are a lot of attractive women.  Take Debra, for example.  I heard that she just broke u p with her boyfriend last week so I decided to ask her out.  

Liam:  Hi, Debra.  How’s it going?  

Debra:  Okay, I guess.  How about you?  

Liam:  I’m doing okay.  You know, I’m going to an art show this Saturday.  Would you like to come with me?  

Debra:  Gee z, I’m pretty busy this weekend.  

Liam:  That’s too bad.  How about going for a drink after work today?   

Debra:  Well, I don’t know...  

Liam:  Come on.  It’ll be fun and we can try that new place down the street.  

Debra:  I guess that’ll be okay, but jus t a drink, right?

Debra:  [laughs]  Okay, then.  I’ll see you after work.   

I ask women out wherever I see them, even ones I’ve never met before.  At a restaurant, if I see a woman eati ng by herself, I usually say: “I just hate eating alone.  Do you mind if I join you?”  The other day, I saw a woman at the grocery store and tried my luck.   

Liam:  Hi.  

Monica:  Hi.  

Liam:  I’ve just moved to this area and was wondering if you could reco mmend a good restaurant around here.   

Monica:  That depends on what kind of food you like.  There’s a good Italian restaurant on Elm Street, or there’s a good Thai place on Lyndon Avenue.  

Liam:  Which one do you prefer?  

Monica:  I like them both, but I ’d probably go for the Italian place.   

Liam:  In that case, would you like to join me for dinner sometime?  

Monica:  I’m not sure.  I don’t even know you.  

Liam:  You’re right, but you seem really nice and I’d like to get to know you better.  What do you  say?  

Monica:  Well, maybe.  Here’s my number.  Call me and we’ll talk about it.  

Liam:  I’ll do that.  I’m looking forward to talking with you again.  

It’s as easy as that.  I don’t try to be a player.  All it takes is a little charm and a little flatter y, and women will find you irresistible.

We watch Liam try to get dates with these different women.  

Liam begins by say ing, “I admit it.  I’m a player.”  To admit, “admit,” something means to say something is true even if you don't want to say it.  It's like confessing something.  Well, what Liam is confessing here is that he's “a player.” Player, “player,” is an informal  expression or informal word that means a man who dates a lot of women, usually at the same time, often without the other women knowing that you are dating more than one woman.  So, Liam says he's “a player,” just like me!  

He says, “I work in an office wh ere there are a lot of attractive women.” Attractive, “attractive,” means pretty or good looking.  He says, “Take Debra, for example,” meaning let's start talking about Debra as an example.  He says, “I heard that she just broke up with her boyfriend.”  T o break up with someone means to end a romantic relationship - to stop a romantic relationship.  This happens here in Hollywood, here in Los Angeles, all the time among celebrities and stars.  So, to break up with someone means to end your relationship.  

Liam then starts talking to Debra, he says, “Hi, Debra.  How’s it going?”   She says, “Okay.”  What about you - “How about you?”   Liam says he's “doing okay.” He says he's “going to an art show” on Saturday.  An art show would be a show looking at pictures or paintings.  Of course, Liam is trying to impress Debra - make Debra think that he is a very cultured person.   

He asks Debra if she would like to come with him, and Debra says, “Geez, I’m pretty busy this weekend.”  This is what the women always used t o tell me when I asked them out on a date!  The expression geez, “geez,” is one we use to express surprise, or perhaps confusion.  Well, Debra is perhaps a little surprised and she says that she's “busy this weekend.”  

Then Liam, who, of course as a player , tries to get women to date him, goes on to say, “That’s too bad.  How about going for a drink after work today?”  To go for a drink means to go have an alcoholic beverage or a soda, maybe a beer, with someone in a bar.   And Debra says, “Well, I don’t kno w,” and Liam starts to try to convince her; he says, “Oh, come on.  It’ll be fun and we can try that new place down the street.”  

Debra finally says, “I guess that’ll be okay, but just a drink, right,” meaning they're just going to have a drink, more or le ss as friends, nothing serious.

Liam goes on to talk about how asks women out - he asks them to go on a date with him.  To ask someone out is to ask them to go on a date.  He says he asks them out whenever he sees them, even ones he's “never met before.”  He then goes on to say that when he's at a restaurant  and he sees “a woman eating by herself,” he'll say to her, “Do you mind if I join you,” meaning is it okay that I sit down with you - will it bother you?  

He says, “The other day,” meaning in a recent day - recently, “I saw a woman at the grocery store an d I tried my luck.”  To try your luck at something is to do something even if you know it may not be successful - even if you know it may not work.  To try your luck - you hope you are successful.  

Liam, of course, begins by simply saying, “Hi” to this wom an.  The woman, Monica, says, “Hi,” and then he, again, probably lying - probably not telling the truth - says, “ I’ve just moved to this area” - I've just moved to this part of the city - “and was wondering if you could recommend a good restaurant around here.”  Of course, what Liam is doing here, as all men know, is trying to start a conversation and trying to find an excuse to talk to this woman.  

Monica says, “That depends on what kind of food you like.”  The expression that depends on, means that is de termined by or that would be influenced by someone or something else.  So, she's saying here, well, there may be good restaurants, but it depends on the restaurant - the kind of restaurant that you like. She then says, “There’s a good Italian restaurant,”  and there's also “a good Thai place.”  Thai, “Thai,” refers to Thailand - the country - and Thai food is very popular in many large cities, like Los Angeles  

Liam says, “Which one do you prefer?”  Which one do you like?   And Monica says, “I like them both , but I’d probably go for the Italian place.”  To go for, here, means to choose or to select.  It also has other meanings, this expression, to go for.  If you look at the Learning Guide, you will see some additional meanings for this expression, but here i t means to select.  

Liam, says, “In that case, would you like to join me for dinner sometime?”  Liam is what we would call very smooth.  To be smooth, “smooth,” if you're a man

Monica says, “I’m not sure.  I don’t even know you.”  Remember, they're at a grocery store.   Liam says, “You’re right, but you seem really nice and I’d like to get to know you better,” meani ng I'd like to find out more about you.  “What do you say?”  What do you say here means what do you think - what is your decision?   Monica says, “Well, maybe.  Here’s my number.  Call me and we’ll talk about it.”  Here’s my number means here is my telephon e number.  

Liam says, “I’ll do that.  I’m looking forward to talking to you again.”  He ends the story by saying that “It’s as easy as that,” meaning it's very simple; you just have to do what he did.  He says he doesn't “try to be a player.  All it takes, ” he says - all that is necessary - all that you need - “All it takes is a little charm and a little flattery, and the women will find you irresistible.”   

A little charm, “charm,” means the power to attract other people - to make them feel comfortable.  If we say about a person, “He's very charming,” we mean that other people like him - he has a good way of relating to other people - talking to other people.  Flattery, “flattery,” are words that you use - things that you say to someone else to compliment them - to make them feel good about themselves.   

What Liam is saying here is that if you have a little charm, and if you can give women some flattery, they “will find you irresistible.”  To be irresistible means that it is impossible for them to say no - for someone to deny.  If a person is irresistible, you mean that the women will have to say yes because they can't say no. 

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native rate of speech.
