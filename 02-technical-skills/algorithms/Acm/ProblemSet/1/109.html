<P>
Some problems are difficult to solve but have a simplification that is
easy to solve.  Rather than deal with the difficulties of constructing a
model of the Earth (a somewhat oblate spheroid),
consider a pre-Columbian flat world that is a 500 kilometer  <IMG WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=18 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline41" SRC="109img1.gif"  >  500
kilometer square.
<P>
In the model used in this problem, the flat world consists of several
warring kingdoms.  Though warlike, the people of the world are strict
isolationists; each kingdom is surrounded by a high (but thin) wall
designed to both protect the kingdom and to isolate it.  To avoid fights
for power, each kingdom has its own electric power plant.
<P>
When the urge to fight becomes too great, the people of a kingdom often
launch missiles at other kingdoms.  Each SCUD missile (Sanitary
Cleansing Universal Destroyer) that
lands within the walls of a kingdom destroys that kingdom's power plant
(without loss of life).
<P>

<P>
Given coordinate locations of several kingdoms (by specifying
the locations of houses and
the location of the power plant in a kingdom) and missile landings you
are to write a program that determines the total area of all kingdoms
that are without power after an exchange of missile fire.
<P>
In the simple world of this problem kingdoms do not overlap.
Furthermore, the walls surrounding each kingdom are considered to be of
zero thickness.  The wall surrounding a kingdom is the minimal-perimeter
wall that completely surrounds all the houses and the power station
that comprise a kingdom;
the area of a kingdom is the area enclosed by the minimal-perimeter thin
wall.
<P>
There is exactly one power station per
kingdom.
<P>
There may be empty space between kingdoms.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">The Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The input is a sequence of kingdom specifications followed by a sequence
of missile landing locations.
<P>
A kingdom is specified by a number <I>N</I> ( <IMG WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline45" SRC="109img2.gif"  > ) on a
single line which
indicates the number of sites in this kingdom.  The next
line contains the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> coordinates of the power station,
followed by <I>N</I>-1 lines of <I>x</I>, <I>y</I> pairs indicating the locations of
homes served by this power station.  A value of -1 for <I>N</I> indicates
that there are no more kingdoms.  There will be at least one kingdom
in the data set.
<P>
Following the last kingdom specification will be the coordinates of
one or more missile attacks, indicating the location of a missile
landing.  Each missile location is on a line by itself.  You are to
process missile attacks until you reach the end of the file.
<P>
Locations are specified in kilometers using coordinates on a 500 km by
500 km grid.  All coordinates will be integers between 0 and 500
inclusive.  Coordinates are specified as a pair of integers separated
by white-space on a single line.  The input file will consist of up to
20 kingdoms, followed by any number of missile attacks.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001004000000000000000">The Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The output consists of a single number representing the total area of
all kingdoms without electricity after all missile attacks have been
processed.  The number should be printed with (and correct to) two
decimal places.

<P>
You may or may not find the following formula useful.
<P>
Given a polygon described by the vertices  <IMG WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline61" SRC="109img3.gif"  >  such that  <IMG WIDTH=55 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline63" SRC="109img4.gif"  > , the signed area of the polygon is given by
<P> <IMG WIDTH=354 HEIGHT=45 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="displaymath59" SRC="109img5.gif"  > <P>
where  the x, y
coordinates of  <IMG WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline65" SRC="109img6.gif"  > ; the edges of the polygon are from  <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline67" SRC="109img7.gif"  >  to
 <IMG WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=18 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline69" SRC="109img8.gif"  >  for  <IMG WIDTH=103 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline71" SRC="109img9.gif"  > .
<P>
If the points describing the polygon are given
in a counterclockwise direction, the value of <I>a</I> will be positive,
and if the points of the polygon are listed in a clockwise direction,
the value of <I>a</I> will be negative.
