[start of dialogue] 

Rene:  Hey, look who’s here.  It’s the company’s go lden boy. 

Bruno:  Very funny.   

Rene:  I’m not joking.  First, you’re recognized at  the annual meeting for your work in the company, and then you get a commendatio n from the city for your volunteer work.  I’m basking in your reflected glor y. 

Bruno:  I didn’t ask for either honor, as you well know.  I’m not a glory hound. 

Rene:  Yes, and that’s what makes it even more gall ing.  You don’t have to go seeking your glory; it comes to you. 

Bruno:  Knock it off!  I like praise as much as the  next guy, but I’d rather not be in the limelight. 

Rene:  I know.  You’re exceptional and you’re modes t about it.  You’re the perfect guy.  You leave us mere mortals in the dust.   

Bruno:  I’m leaving.  I know you love giving me a h ard time, but remember this: I give as good as I get – and I have a long memory!

Our dialogue begins with Rene saying, “Hey, look wh o’s here.”  What happens here is that Bruno is walking into the room, and Re ne is talking about Bruno. She’s saying, “Hey, look who’s here.”  Look at who has just come into the room. “It’s the company’s golden boy.”  The expression “g olden boy” refers to someone who’s very successful or gifted or talented that ot her people admire.  Rene is being funny; she’s being sarcastic here; however, s he isn’t really praising or saying nice things about Bruno.  Bruno understands that; he says, “Very funny,” meaning he knows it’s not funny.  Rene says, “I’m n ot joking.  First, you’re recognized at the annual meeting for your work in t he company.”  “To be recognized” here means that someone says something nice about you, someone compliments you – praises you in public, usually in  front of a group of people or in some newspaper or official publication.  That’s to be recognized.  “To recognize” can also mean that you see someone or so mething and you remember what it is because you’ve seen it before.  But here, it just means to be praised, to be complimented on something.   

Rene says, “First, you are recognized at the annual  meeting (that is, a meeting for the whole company that happens once a year), th en you get a commendation from the city for your volunteer work.”  A “commend ation” is an official often certificate or a letter that is given someone to th ank them for their work.  It’s an award that an organization or a government agency o r a government organization might give someone for the work that t hey have done – the good work that they have done.  In this case, Bruno has done volunteer work; he has worked without being paid for some group.   

Rene says, “I’m basking in your reflected glory.”  “To bask” (bask) usually means to sit in the sun so that you can get a tan, or sim ply for the pleasure of feeling the warmth of the sun.  But it’s often used, this verb “to bask,” with the word “glory” to mean to enjoy all of the good things that are happe ning to you, the praise, the compliments that people are giving you.  “I’m going  to bask in the glory of my victory.”  Everyone is thanking me or congratulatin g me, looking at me, saying nice things about me.  I’m going to bask in that; I ’m going to enjoy it.  What Rene is saying, however, is a little different.  She’s s aying, “I’m basking in your reflected glory.”  When light hits a mirror, it’s r eflected, it goes off of the mirror and back out again.  What Rene is saying is that sh e doesn’t have any glory of her own, no one is praising her, but people are pra ising Bruno and so she’s enjoying the praise that is reflected from Bruno to  her because all of the wonderful things that Bruno has done and has been r ecognized for.  Once again, she’s making a joke here. 

Bruno says, “I didn’t ask for either honor, as you well know.”  An “honor” (honor) is recognition or praise that you receive, usually from a powerful organization or  

person.  The president may give you an honor, such as giving you an award for something.  Bruno says that he didn’t ask for these  honors; he didn’t try to get these honors.  He says, “I’m not a glory hound.”  A  “glory hound” (hound) is someone who is always looking for praise, someone w ho always wants to be recognized, who wants everyone to say nice things a bout them.  Rene says, “Yes,” she understands that Bruno is not a glory ho und, “and that’s what makes it even more galling.”  Something that is “galling” (g alling) is something that is annoying or irritating because it seems unfair.  Re ne says, “You don’t have to go seeking your glory; it comes to you.” 

Bruno says, “Knock it off!”  “Knock it off” means s top it; it’s an informal expression that means stop doing what you’re doing.  You don’t  like it, you want the other person to stop it.  A child may be screaming or tal king loudly or crying, and the mother may say, “Knock it off,” meaning stop doing that.  Bruno says, “Knock it off.  I like praise as much as the next guy.”  “Pra ise” is something nice that someone says about you.  The expression “as much as  the next guy” is used to emphasize that you are normal, that you are just li ke everyone else, that you are no different than everyone else.  He says, “I like praise (I like to be complimented) as much as the next guy (just like ev eryone else), but I’d rather not be in the limelight.”  The “limelight” (limelig ht – one word) means to have a lot of attention, when everyone is looking on you.  It could mean that your picture is in the newspaper, and the television news is talkin g about you; that’s to be in the limelight 

Rene says, “I know.  You’re exceptional and you’re modest about it.” “Exceptional” means very good at something, better than anyone else, “extraordinary” we might say.  Rene says that Bruno  is exceptional and he’s modest about it.  “To be modest” (modest) means to be humble, not to talk to other people about it.  Here, “to be modest” means to be good, but not to talk about it to everyone else.  Rene says, “You’re the perfect guy.  You leave us mere mortals in the dust.”  A “mortal” (mortal) is someone who will die, all of us human beings are mortal, but the expression “mere m ortals” means ordinary people, people who aren’t extraordinary, who are no t exceptional.  “To leave (someone) in the dust” means to beat another person  in a competition, to be superior to someone else, to win in such a way that  the other person is not even close to you.  Rene says to Bruno that he leaves me re mortals – us mere mortals the dust, he is much better than the rest of us. 

Bruno says, “I’m leaving.  I know you love giving m e a hard time.”  “To give (someone) a hard time” means to criticize someone, usually by making fun of them.  Bruno says, “remember this: I give as good a s I get.”  The expression “to give as good as you get” means I can criticize joki ngly, I can tease (tease) you  

just as much as you tease me – as you make fun of m e, as you criticize me. “And,” Bruno says, “I have a long memory!”  “To hav e a long memory” means that you will remember things for a long time.  Wiv es have very long memories, they will remember things that you said and did yea rs and years ago.  All husbands know this! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
