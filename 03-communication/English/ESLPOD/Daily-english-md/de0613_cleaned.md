This episode is called “Being a First-Time Parent.”  It is a dialogue between Ricardo and Zuly.  They’re going to be talking about be ing parents, having a baby for the first time.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Zuly:  Hello. 

Ricardo:  Hi, Zuly.  How are you? 

Zuly:  Oh, Ricardo, it’s you.  I’m doing okay.  How are you? 

Ricardo:  I wanted to call and congratulate you on th e birth of your new baby. 

Zuly:  Thanks a lot.  Carla was born three weeks ago, and  she was eight pounds, three ounces.   

Ricardo:  That’s great!  How does it feel to be a first -time parent? 

Zuly:  It’s really overwhelming taking care of a newborn.   I’m learning everything from scratch, everything from how to breastfeed and bot tle-feed, to burping her, to putting her to bed, to using a car seat and a stroll er.   

Ricardo:  You sound overwhelmed.  I remember when Ada m, our first child, was born.  There were the feedings in the middle of the night, and all of those diapers! 

 Zuly:  Exactly.  I’m exhausted all the time.  In fact, I f ind myself dozing off at all hours of the day. 

Ricardo:  I really sympathize with you, but these days will  pass quickly, and then you’ll have such great memories.  Have you had much sleep? 

Zuly:  Zzzzzzzz! 

Ricardo:  Zuly?  Zuly?

Ricardo calls Zuly on the telephone.  Zuly answers, “Hell o.”  Ricardo says, “Hi, Zuly.  How are you?”  Zuly says, “Oh, Ricardo, it’s you (mea ning she recognizes who is calling).  I’m doing okay.  How are you?”  Ricardo  says, “I wanted to call and congratulate you on the birth of your new baby.”  “ Birth” is when a new child is brought into the world; when a baby comes out of his or her mother’s womb – comes out of her body and begins breathing on its own, w e call that birth.  This is the birth of Zuly’s new baby. 

Zuly says, “Thanks a lot.  Carla (the name of her baby) was born three weeks ago, and she was eight pounds, three ounces.”  It’s common  for parents to often tell someone about their baby and include how big it w as – how much it weighed. This baby weighed eight pounds, three ounces.  I weighed , I think, nine pounds, four ounces.  I was a big baby – mostly my head! 

Ricardo says, “That’s great!  How does it feel to be a fi rst-time parent?”  “First- time” means, as you can guess, that it is the first event –  the first occasion for this particular thing, in this case for being a parent.   So, they are first-time parents.  It could mean that they are going to have mor e children in the future, we don’t know, but definitely it means that this is the ir first baby. 

Zuly says, “It’s really overwhelming taking care of a newbo rn.”  Something that is “overwhelming” (one word) is very strong, too strong, too  powerful, something that makes you feel that you don’t have control, it may b e something that confuses you.  If you go to Phoenix, Arizona in the middle  of summer – and I do not recommend it – you will be overwhelmed by the heat.   It is very hot in Phoenix, Arizona in the summertime.  Zuly says that it is o verwhelming taking care of a newborn.  “Newborn” (newborn – one word) i s a baby that has been born very recently, usually within the past month or perha ps two months.   

 Zuly is saying that her child is a newborn; she was born re cently.  She says, “I’m learning everything from scratch.”  The expression “fro m scratch” (scratch) means from the very beginning, without any preparation,  or any knowledge in this case.  The term is often used cooking.  “I’m going to ma ke a cake from scratch,” meaning I’m not going to use any prepared ingredient s, I’m not going to go to the store and buy a box that says “lemon cake” on it.  I’m goi ng to get the lemons, get the flour get the eggs and so forth.  That is to make something from scratch. You can use it for anything; you could make a table from  scratch, taking a bunch of wood and putting it together, I guess.  I don’t m ean I could do that, but you could do that.  And if you want to do that you can give the table to me because, see, I need a new table here in my room.  Anyway, Zuly is learning everything from scratch, from the very beginning.  By the way, “scratc h” has other meanings in English, very different.  Those, you can only find in our Learning Guide…and a dictionary…and on the web…but most importantly in our Lea rning Guide! 

Zuly says she’s learning everything from how to breastfeed a nd bottle-feed, to burping her, to putting her to bed, to using a car se at and a stroller.  Well, these are all common words when talking about taking care of a  baby.  Let’s begin with my favorite: “breastfeed” (breastfeed – one word).  “To  breastfeed” as a verb means that the mother feeds the young baby with the mil k from her breasts, which are those two things that make up the chest of a w oman.  The end of the breast is called a “nipple” (nipple); we also use that same word when we have a bottle of milk that we are feeding the baby with.  Th at’s the other way to feed the baby, to “bottle-feed” the baby.  A “ bottle,” of cour se, is a small, usually glass container – could be plastic, I guess.  In any case, these a re the two ways of giving milk to a baby: one is to breastfeed and one is to  bottle-feed.  Some people believe breastfeeding is better for the baby.  In any case, Zuly is learning to do both. 

She’s also learning to burp her baby.  The verb “to bur p” here means that you take the baby, so I’m told, meaning I don’t do this, bu t you, again, could take the baby and you very gently, very softly hit the back of the bab y after the baby has drunken milk to help the baby push air out of the stoma ch into his or her mouth. This usually produces what we would call “spit up” (spit up).  This is something that mothers or fathers will do for their baby after t hey have been fed with milk. That’s one of the things Zuly is learning how to do.  S he’s also learning how to put the baby to bed.  “To put (someone) to bed” is a phrasal verb meaning to get a baby or a child ready to sleep, try to calm him or her  until he or she falls asleep. Sometimes mothers and fathers will move the child back a nd forth very slowly, gently.  They may sing a song; we call those songs that you  sing to a baby to put them to sleep a “lullaby” (lullaby).  A common lullaby i n English is called “Lullaby  

 and Goodnight,” using music from the classical composer Brah ms:  Lullaby and goodnight .  I don’t know the rest of the words; when my mother sa ng it to me, that’s all I needed and I fell asleep.  Sorry!   

Zuly is also learning how to use a car seat.  In the Uni ted States it is the law in most states, you are required to place your baby in a speci al I guess we could call at a chair that goes inside the car.  It is to keep t hem safe in an accident.  So, Zuly is learning how to use a car seat and a stroller.  A  “stroller” (stroller) is also called a “baby carriage.”  Basically, it’s like a small chai r that has wheels on it that you can push in front of you.  So, if you want to t ake a walk you could put the baby in the stroller.  When I was growing up, strolle rs were very small. Nowadays, at least here in the United States, you see so me parents that have strollers that are like the size of a small car – they’re  huge!  And they put all of these things that they think they need for the baby; it’ s kind of amazing.   

But anyway, getting back to our story: Zuly is learning to use a car seat and a stroller.  Ricardo says, “You sound overwhelmed.  I rememb er when Adam, our first child (Ricardo’s first baby), was born.  There were the feedings in the middle of the night, and all those diapers!”   “Feeding” (f eeding), a noun, comes from the verb “to feed,” which means to give food to someone, in this case to give the baby milk, either from a bottle or, we would say, “nursi ng,” which is another term referring to breastfeeding.  So there are feedings in  the middle of the night; young babies wake up in the middle of the night and wa nt to eat.  You could tell them just to wait until morning, but they probably won ’t be too happy, and you probably won’t sleep because they’ll be crying, you see!  H e also talks about all of the diapers they needed for their little child.  A “diaper” (diaper) is a small piece of cloth or, more commonly in the U.S. now, paper and plastic that is wrapped around the baby’s bottom in order to hold in – to catch , really, their urine, what we would informally called their “pee” (pee) that come s out the front end; out the back end comes what we technically call their “feces” (feces) , but for a baby informally we would say “poop” (poop), “poop.”  Isn’t t his fun? 

Zuly says, “Exactly (she agrees with Ricardo).  I’m exhausted all the time.”  “To be exhausted” means to be extremely tired, typically from doing a lot of physical work.  Zuly says, “I find myself,” meaning sometimes, “I f ind myself dozing off at all hours of the day.”  “At all hours of the day” means anytime during the day, at different times during the day.  “To doze (doze) off” m eans to fall asleep for a short period of time, usually something that you weren’ t planning to do.  You just sort of accidentally, if you will, fall asleep because you a re so tired.  We might also use the verb “to nap” (nap): “I was napping at my d esk the other day when Lucy came into the office and woke me up and said I should  start working again.”    

 Zuly says that she finds herself dozing off at all hours of  the day.  Ricardo says, “I really sympathize with you,” I really understand your probl em or your difficult situation; I feel sad for you, “but,” he says, “these days ( these early days) will pass quickly (they will not seem like they took very much time) , and then you’ll have such great memories.”  “Memories” are the things th at you remember. Ricardo then asks Zuly, “Have you had much sleep?” and Zuly is sleeping; she goes, “Zzzzzzzz!”  Ricardo says, “Zuly?  Zuly?” trying to wake her up. 

I hope you didn’t doze off during this episode.  Now we ’ll listen to the dialogue at a normal rate of speech.
