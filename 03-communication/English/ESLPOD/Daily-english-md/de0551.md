This episode is about how to make an appointment with yo ur doctor or some medical professional by calling them on the phone.  It’s going to give a lot of vocabulary related to hospitals and doctors and medical ap pointments.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

I needed to make an appointment with a doctor so I cal led my health plan’s phone number for new patients.  Before I could schedule  my appointment, I had to listen to several recorded messages to be routed to th e right medical office. The recording said to stay on the line for assistance.   

Clerk:  Hello, Western Medical Group. 

Damien:  Hello, I’d like to make an appointment with Dr. Gupta. 

Clerk:  Are you a new patient or a returning patient?  

Damien:  I’m a new patient. 

Clerk:  Who referred you to Dr. Gupta?   

Damien:  No one.  One of the health benefits of my pl an is that I can self-refer to some specialists. 

Clerk:  What is the name of your plan and your medical r ecord number? 

 Damien:  It’s Waiser and my medical record number is 234 56789. 

Clerk:  It looks like Dr. Gupta is booked up for the next three weeks.  She has an opening on March 2nd, at 4:30 p.m. 

Damien:  I was hoping to get an early morning appoint ment.   

Clerk:  The next morning appointment won’t be until M arch 18th, at 11:00.  You’ll need to check in at 10:45 to fill out paperwork.  Shou ld I put you down for that? 

Damien:  Is it possible to get an even earlier appointm ent? 

Clerk:  Dr. Gupta doesn’t begin seeing patients until 1 0:30. 

Damien:  10:30?  Isn’t that pretty late? 

Clerk:  Dr. Gupta likes to play golf in the mornings. 

Damien:  Why do you think I want an early morning appoi ntment?  Doesn’t she know that some of her patients prefer late-morning gol f?

Our story begins with Damien saying, “I needed to make  an appointment with a doctor so I called my health plan’s phone number for new  patients.”  An “appointment” is a scheduled meeting, a specific day and t ime when you are going to do something.  Damien called his health plan’ s phone number for new patients.  A “health plan” is an insurance plan – a med ical insurance plan that helps pay for your medical expenses if you are sick.  “Patie nts” are people who receive medical treatment or medical advice from a doctor or a hospital.  If you’re a patient, that means that some doctor is looking after you – is taking care of you. Damien needed a medical appointment so he called his he alth plan – his insurance company’s number for new patients.  “Before I  could schedule an appointment,” he says, “I had to listen to several recorde d messages to be routed to the right medical office.”  “To be routed” (routed ) means to be sent to the right person or in the right direction.  In this case, if you’r e calling a large company you want to talk to the correct department.  “The recording  said to stay on the line for assistance.”  “To stay on the line” means not to hang up t he phone, to wait on the phone until someone answers; we also say “to hold.”  If yo u call a company, the person answering the phone, if they’re busy, may say “please  hold,” meaning I’m going to put the phone down, but don’t hang up – do n’t go away. 

 Finally the clerk answers the phone by saying, “Hello, Weste rn Medical Group.” A “medical group” is a group of doctors who work togethe r in the same building, usually not a hospital.  It could be a medical office bui lding, or it could be a “clinic,” which is sort of like a small hospital.  Damien sa ys, “Hello, I’d like to make an appointment with Dr. Gupta.”  The clerk says, “Ar e you a new patient or a returning patient (is this is the first time you’ve seen  or are going to see Dr. Gupta, or have you seen Dr. Gupta before)?”  “Returni ng,” here, means you’ve already used the services of this doctor – you’ve already s een this doctor before. 

Damien says, “I’m a new patient,” and the clerk says, “Who referred you to Dr. Gupta?”  “To refer” (refer) means to recommend that someone see a particular person or a particular company; in this case, a particular or specific doctor. Someone says, “Oh, my neck really hurts,” and somebody else says,  “Oh, you should go see Dr. McQuillan, he is a very good neck doctor.”   I’m not sure if there are neck doctors; it’s just an example!  So Damien says, “No  one (meaning no one referred me to Dr. Gupta).  One of the health b enefits of my plan is that I can self-refer to some specialists.”  A “benefit” is a good th ing; a “health benefit” is something that you get from your health insurance; it’s something that is included in your insurance.  Damien says, “One of the health bene fits of my plan (meaning my insurance) is that I can self-refer to some specialists.”  “To self-refer” means to be able to request to see certain doctors without havi ng another doctor refer you, or another doctor approve that you can go see this pa rticular doctor. Usually, this has to do with doctors who are specialists.  A  “specialist” is an expert in a specific area of medicine.  So if you are a h and surgeon – you work on people’s hands – you are a specialist.  In many insurance  plans in the United States you can’t just go see any doctor you want to; first  you have to go see what’s called your “general practitioner,” or the doctor  who’s a general doctor, and if you have a specific problem that doctor will refer  you to a specialist.  There are some health plans where you can self-refer to certain  specialists. 

The clerk says, “What is the name of your plan and your me dical record number?”  Your “medical record number,” sometimes call ed your “patient number,” is a number that the insurance plan gives you so that they can identify you.  It’s a number that only you have.  I don’t know wha t my medical record number is; it’s about eight or nine digits long – eigh t or nine numbers long. Damien says that the name of his plan (his health plan; his insurance) is Waiser and his medical record number is 23456789.  Boy, that’s a mazing how his medical record number are consecutive numbers between two  and nine! 

Anyway, the clerk says, “It looks like Dr. Gupta is booked up for the next three weeks.”  “To be booked up” means to have a very busy, full  schedule; you don’t have any time to see anyone for any appointments.  The wo rd “book” has a  

 number of different meanings however; take a look at o ur Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  The clerk says that Dr. Gupt a has an opening on March 2nd, at 4:30 p.m.  When we say “you have an opening,” we mean you have a period of time when you are available, when you can se e someone.  In this case, it’s a time that Dr. Gupta can see a new patient, such as Damien. 

Damien says, “I was hoping to get an early morning appoi ntment.”  The clerk says, “The next morning appointment won’t be until March  18th, at 11:00.  You’ll need to check in at 10:45 to fill out paperwork.”  “To  check in” means to come to the office and talk to someone and let them know that yo u are here.  So basically it means you have to show up at 10:45; you have to be in the office at 10:45. Why so early if the appointment is not until 11:00?  Be cause, the clerk says, Damien has to fill out, or complete, some paperwork.  “Paperwork” are usually forms that you have to fill out, things that you need t o write down – information – on a sheet of paper.  We often use this term to indicat e not very interesting but necessary information.  The clerk asks, “Should I put you dow n for that?”  “To put (someone) down,” in this case, means to schedule someone fo r something by writing his or her name on a calendar or an appointme nt book.  To sign or to register someone for something means to put someone dow n.  If the clerks says, “I’ll put you down for 11:00,” she means I will schedule  you for 11:00; I will write your name down for 11:00. 

Damien says, “Is it possible to get an even earlier appoi ntment (earlier in the day)?”  The clerk says, “Dr. Gupta doesn’t begin seeing pat ients until 10:30 (10:30 in the morning).”  Damien says, “10:30?  Isn’t that pretty late (isn’t that very late)?”  The clerk says, “Dr. Gupta likes to play golf i n the mornings.” Damien says, “Why do you think I want an early morning app ointment?  Doesn’t she know that some of her patients prefer late-morning golf?”  In other words, the joke here is that Dr. Gupta likes to play golf in the m orning so she cannot be there before 10:30; Damien is saying he likes to play go lf in the late morning, say 10:30-11:00, and that’s why he wants an early appointm ent.  The expression “to put down” also has a very different meaning; take a look at the Learning Guide for that other meaning.  There’s a standard joke that doctors have a lot of free time – a lot of extra time that they can use to do thin gs like play golf, which is, of course, a little bit expensive.  This is just a joke however ; most doctors, I don’t think, have very much time – at least, the majority of t hem. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
