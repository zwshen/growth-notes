On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Curran and Beth about buying shoes for a man. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Curran: I like these tennis shoes. I need a new pai r.

Beth: We’re here to buy you some dress shoes for at tending Chelsey’s wedding. You can’t go wearing those worn-out loafers, and yo u need time to break them in.

Curran: All right. Just pick whatever you think is suitable and let’s go.

Beth: Don’t you want to have a say in what you wear ? I think these oxfords are nice. What do you think?

Curran: Great. I’m a size 10 and a half. I’ll try t hem on and we’ll go.

Beth: You can’t just buy the first pair of shoes yo u see. How about these?

Curran: Those patent leather shoes? They have purpl e laces. Well, if you think they’re okay . . .

Beth: No, they’re not. These shoes are totally wron g for the occasion, not to mention hideous. I was just trying to get a rise ou t of you so you’ll pick the shoes you like.

Curran: But I don’t care what I wear. Just pick a p air.

 Beth: No, you pick.

Curran: Fine. How about these?

Beth: No, they’re not dressy enough. They look more  like sandals than dress shoes.

Curran: Then how about these?

Beth: Those boots? Definitely not.

Curran: Okay, these then.

Beth: Those shoes fasten with Velcro. Are you kiddi ng me?

Curran: Okay, why don’t you just tell me what my ta ste should be and I’ll buy what you want me to buy?

Beth: And leave you with no say in your own purchas e? What kind of cousin would I be if I did that?

Curran begins our dialogue by saying to Beth, “I li ke these tennis shoes. I need a new pair.” Beth and Curran are out shopping for, or  looking to buy, some shoes for Curran. Curran says he likes these “tennis shoe s.” “Tennis shoes” are sometimes called “athletic shoes,” or in some parts  of the U.S., “gym shoes.” Basically they are comfortable shoes that are worn for playing many different kinds of sports, as well as for running.

Beth, however, says, “We’re here to buy you some dr ess shoes for attending Chelsey’s wedding. You can’t go wearing those worn- out loafers, and you need time to break them in.” “Dress (dress) shoes” are n ice-looking shoes. Shoes that, I guess you could say, a woman would wear with a dr ess. However, we use the term “dress shoes” for both men and women to descri be a very nice pair of shoes – shoes you could wear to a formal event.

Beth and Curran are there at the shoe store to buy Curran some dress shoes for attending, or going to, a wedding – Chelsey’s weddi ng. Beth says, “You can’t go wearing those worn-out loafers.” When we say someth ing is “worn (worn) out,” we mean it’s old and it looks old. Often we use thi s expression for things that you

can no longer use, or no longer work properly, or a re no longer appropriate for certain things.

Beth is saying that Curran’s loafers are worn out. “Loafers” (loafers) are leather shoes that have a flat bottom to them – what we wou ld call a “flat heel,” which is the back bottom of a shoe – that are considered som ewhat informal. Usually loafers don’t have little strings that you use to t ighten the shoe in front. We call those little strings “shoelaces.” Loafers don’t hav e shoelaces, so they’re very easy to put on and take off.

Beth says that Curran is going to need time “to bre ak them in.” “Them” here refers to the new shoes. But what does it mean to b reak in new shoes? “To break in” here means to wear something, especially shoes,  for a while so that they’re comfortable. As you probably know, when you buy a n ew pair of shoes, sometimes it takes a while for your feet to get com fortable in the shoe itself so that the shoe feels good and is easy to wear.

“To break in shoes,” then, is to wear these shoes u sually for a little bit of time every day until you can wear the shoes without any discomfort. “To break in” as a phrasal verb has a very different meaning in Englis h as well, which is to steal – to go in, usually to a house or to a building, and to steal things, to rob things from that place. But here it’s not used to refer to anyo ne stealing anything, but rather to wear shoes until they are comfortable.

Curran says, “All right. Just pick whatever you thi nk is suitable and let’s go.” Curran is telling Beth that she should pick somethi ng that she likes and that’s what Curran will buy. Beth says, “Don’t you want to  have a say in what you wear?” “To have a say in” something is to have an o pinion – to express, more importantly, your opinion and be part of the decisi on. Beth is surprised that Curran wants her to pick his shoes.

She then says, “I think these oxfords are nice.” “O xfords” (oxfords) are leather shoes with a very simple shape that have shoelaces on top of them, but not all the way down to the toes. You may be confused becau se the word “Oxford” is usually used to describe a famous university in Eng land, but here it’s used to describe a kind of shoe. If you look up “oxfords” w ith an “s” at the end in a dictionary, you’ll see the definition of this kind of shoe.

Beth says, “What do you think?” “Do you like the sh oes?” she’s asking Curran. Curran says, “Great. I’m a size 10 and a half. I’ll  try them on and we’ll go.” Curran just wants to try on the shoes and leave. Beth says , “You can’t just buy the first pair of shoes you see. How about these?” Beth wants  Curran to look at more

shoes, different kinds of shoes, before he makes a decision. She shows him another pair of shoes.

Curran says, “Those patent leather shoes?” “Patent (patent) leather” is a very shiny leather that’s often used for shoes and for p urses that women, for example, would typically wear – small bags that a woman woul d have to put all of the things that women have that they want to take with them. Patent leather is a popular material for shoes. Curran, however, is not  quite sure about this pair of shoes that Beth is suggesting.

He says, “They have purple laces.” “Laces” (laces) refers to shoelaces – the string or cord that we use on the top front part of  the shoe to tighten it, to make sure that your foot stays in the shoe. Curran says,  “Well, if you think they’re okay . . .” Beth then replies, “No, they’re not.” She’s testing Curran, I guess, trying to get Curran to see that he has to take this decision  seriously, so she suggests a pair of shoes that are clearly not appropriate for a wedding.

She says, “These shoes are totally wrong” – meaning  completely wrong – “for the occasion,” for the event, “not to mention hideous.”  “Hideous” (hideous) means horrible – in this case, horrible looking, terrible  looking. Something that’s really ugly would be hideous. Beth says these shoes are hi deous. She uses the expression “not to mention” (mention). “Not to ment ion” is a common phrase in conversational English that is used to place emphas is on something, especially when we are listing reasons for something.

For example, someone may ask you to go out to dinne r at a restaurant, but you can’t go, and so you start telling the person why y ou can’t go. “Well,” you say to the person, “I need to do my homework, and my broth er is coming to visit, not to mention I also have to wash my clothes tonight.” Yo u’re giving the person different reasons, and then you’re emphasizing one of those reasons. That’s how we would use “not to mention.”

Beth says, “I was just trying to get a rise out of you so you’ll pick the shoes you like.” “To get a rise (rise) out of” someone is to make someone react – especially in anger, or perhaps in annoyance – usually because  you think that reaction is going to be funny or entertaining. When you try to get a rise out of someone, you’re trying to get the person angry, but for a fu nny reason or a funny purpose – at least, you think it’s funny. Curran says, “But I  don’t care what I wear. Just pick a pair.”

Curran is telling Beth to pick a pair of shoes for him. Beth says, “No, you pick.” Curran says, “Fine. How about these?” Beth says, “N o, they’re not dressy

enough.” “Dressy” here means formal. “They look mor e like sandals than dress shoes.” “Sandals” (sandals) are shoes typically wor n in warm weather that are not a complete shoe. Sandals are usually open in the back, or at least part of the foot is exposed, so you can see a lot of the skin o n your feet.

You can wear socks over your feet with sandals, but  they’re most commonly worn without socks. They’re usually found at the be ach, for example. They’re not appropriate for a formal event like a wedding. Curr an says, “Then how about these?” Beth says, “Those boots? Definitely not.” B oots” (boots) are very tall or high shoes that come up high on your leg. Boots, on ce again, are not considered formal shoes, and therefore not appropriate for a w edding. Curran says, “Okay, these then.”

Beth says, “Those shoes fasten with Velcro. Are you  kidding me?” “To fasten” (fasten) means to connect something together, usual ly with a button or some other small device on the cloth itself like a “snap ” (snap). “Velcro” (Velcro) is a plastic material that you are able to put together so that it stays; you don’t have to tie it. The two parts of the Velcro hook together a nd are able to keep something together – to hold something together or to connect  something together. There are some shoes that instead of shoelaces have Velcr o on them. But once again, those shoes are not appropriate for a wedding.

Curran says, “Okay, why don’t you just tell me what  my taste should be and I’ll buy what you want me to buy.” Curran is telling Bet h that she needs to tell him what his taste should be. “Taste” (taste) here refe rs to the kinds of things that you like. You can talk about your “taste in food” or yo ur “taste in clothing.” It doesn’t refer necessarily to something you eat. That’s also  the use of the verb “to taste” – to put something in your mouth and to get a sense o f the flavor of the food.

But it means much more generally the kinds of thing s that you like. It could refer to any kind of object or activity that you like. Cu rran is telling Beth, “Just tell me what you like” – what you think I should buy – “and  I’ll buy it.” Beth, however, says, “And leave you with no say in your own purcha se? What kind of cousin would I be if I did that?” Beth, even though she do esn’t like anything that Curran has selected, does not want to tell Curran what to buy.

That’s why she says, “And leave you with no say in your own purchase?” – in the thing that you are about to buy. “What kind of cous in,” she asks, “would I be if I did that?” Your “cousin” (cousin) refers to the son  or daughter of either your aunt or your uncle. Your “aunt” is your mother or father ’s sister. Your “uncle” is your mother or father’s brother. So, it’s the child of o ne of your aunts or uncles.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
