Our dialogue today is between Gladys and Dan about the father in the family staying home to take care of the children while the  mother goes out and works. Sounds like fun. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gladys: Hi, Dan. I’m surprised to see you here at t he supermarket in the middle of the day.

Dan: Why?

Gladys: I thought you’d be working.

Dan: I am working. I’m a stay-at-home dad and I tak e care of the kids while my wife goes to work.

Gladys: Oh, did you get laid off from your job?

Dan: No, my wife works full-time out of the house a nd I work full-time at home.

Gladys: You mean that your wife is the breadwinner and you’re a househusband?

Dan: If you want to put it that way, yes. I’m the c aretaker for the kids during the day and I do the household chores.

Gladys: Oh, your wife must be a feminist.

Dan: No, my wife is just a modern woman with modern  sensibilities.

Gladys: Well, I know that some families like to liv e radical lifestyles these days, changing up gender roles.

Dan: We don’t think of it as radical. In fact, it’s  quite common nowadays.

Gladys: if you say so. Tell your wife I’d be happy to share my recipes with her when you go back to work and she’s a housewife agai n.

Dan: [sigh]

Our dialogue begins with Gladys saying to Dan, “Hi,  Dan. I'm surprised to see you here at the supermarket in the middle of the da y.” The “supermarket” is the store you go to, to buy food. The “middle of the da y” would be sometime usually between, say, eight in the morning and five in the afternoon, when people are normally working, at least Monday through Friday.

Dan says, “Why?” Why are you surprised? Gladys says , “I thought you'd be working.” Dan says, “I am working. I'm a stay-at-ho me dad and I take care of the kids while my wife goes to work.” A “stay-at-home d ad,” or father, is a dad who does not work outside of the house but instead take s care of the children. In the traditional family, in the United States and in mos t countries, the mother would stay home to take care of the children and the fath er would go out to work.

Times have changed, at least in some families; not in most, but in some families, the father may stay home. I think this is still pro bably fairly rare in the United States, but it does happen. I had a friend of mine who was a stay-at-home dad. His wife worked as a lawyer, and he stayed home to take care of the children. Dan says he's a stay-at-home dad and he takes care of the kids while his wife goes to work.

Gladys says, “Oh, did you get laid off from your jo b?” “To be laid (laid) off” means the employer said that you no longer have a job at that company. The employer said, “I'm sorry. We need to let some people go.” W e need to dismiss you from your job. Normally, when we use the expression “to be laid off,” we mean that the person didn’t do anything wrong. The company let the person go – ended the person’s job – because of some problem in the compa ny or some change in the company.

If we say someone was “fired” (fired), then we are saying that person did something wrong and the company got rid of them. If  you're fired from your job,

it's because you did something wrong. If you're lai d off from your job, it's because the company decided that it needed fewer employees,  or somehow you were no longer needed at the company.

Dan says that he was not laid off. He said, “No, my  wife works full-time out of the house and I work full-time at home.” “Full-time” me ans you’re working at least 40 hours at a job. “To work outside of the home” would  mean to go to another building and work during the day. “To work at home”  would be to stay in your house or apartment and work.

Gladys, however, has having a little difficulty und erstanding the situation. She says, “You mean that your wife is the breadwinner a nd you're a househusband?” “You mean” is short for "Are you saying to me? Do y ou mean?" Gladys is saying that Dan's wife is the breadwinner. “To be a breadw inner” (breadwinner) is to be the person who earns the most money or the majority  of the money for a household. The breadwinner would be the person who is making the most money and therefore supporting the rest of the family.

A “househusband” is a rather new expression. The tr aditional term for a woman staying home would be a “housewife” (housewife) – o ne word. A “househusband” is a husband who stays home and takes care of the h ouse and family. Dan says, “If you want to put it that way, yes.” The expressi on “to put it that way” means to say something in a particular way, especially in a way that you hadn't thought about before or that you hadn't considered before.

Dan says, “I’m the caretaker of the kids during the  day and I do the household chores.” A “caretaker” (caretaker) is someone who t akes care of someone or something. In this case, Dan is referring to him ta king care of their children. “Household chores” refers to things that you do in a house in order to keep it clean and working properly – to make sure that ever ything is getting done that needs to be done. “Household chores” would include washing the windows every once in a while. My wife tells me once every three or four months. I think really once a year is enough, don't you?

Doing the dishes, taking out the trash, cleaning the house, fixing things that break – all of these would be examples of household  chores. The word “chore” (chore) is something you’re required to do that is usually somewhat unpleasant. If you say something is a “chore,” you mean it's diffi cult and not very fun to do. “Household” just refers to things done in a house –  where a “house” refers to an apartment, a townhouse, a condominium, or an actual  separate home.

Gladys says, “Oh, your wife must be a feminist.” A “feminist” (feminist) is a difficult word to define. Everybody has a slightly different definition. In general, people understand the word to mean a woman who is i n favor of equal rights for men and women, who doesn't believe in the tradition al roles or responsibilities and duties that a woman would have, for example, in  a marriage. However, the term has taken on all sorts of political meanings a s well. So, when someone uses it, you have to be very careful to understand what exactly they mean by it.

We’re not exactly sure what Gladys means by saying that Dan's wife is a feminist. It might be a criticism of Dan's wife or a suggestion that Dan's wife is somehow unusual in wanting to work outside of the h ome. Dan says, “No, my wife is just a modern woman with modern sensibiliti es.” That's an interesting response. Dan is saying, “No, my wife is not a femi nist” – again, because the word feminist can sometimes be used negatively as w ell as positively.

Dan doesn't want to use that term to describe his w ife. Instead, he says his wife is “just a modern woman, with modern sensibilities. ” “Sensibility” refers to the way you think about something, the way you feel abo ut a particular thing, or a particular way that something works. The word “mode rn” refers to the way things are done now, in comparison perhaps to the way they  were done 20 years ago or 50 years ago or 100 years ago.

Many people believe “modern” means good, that if it 's something we do now, then it must be good. This, of course, is a rather naïve way of looking at the world. “Naïve” (naïve) means innocent but not very intelligent. I'm not saying, of course, that it's a bad idea that Dan's wife works outside the home. I'm just pointing out the use of the word “modern” here mean s more than just the way we do things now. It's meant to be a very positive des cription of something, typically.

Gladys says, “Well, I know that some families like to live radical lifestyles these days, changing up gender roles.” Gladys is saying t hat what Dan and his wife are doing is “radical” (radical). “To be radical” means  to be very extreme, to be very different than what normal people do. A “lifestyle”  is just the way that you live, the style in which you live, the manner in which you li ve. A “radical lifestyle” would be living in a way that almost no one else does. Glady s talks also about “changing up gender roles.” “To change up” is a phrasal verb that here means to change something in an unexpected or unusual way.

“Gender roles” refers to the way that men and women , boys and girls, act and behave. “To change up gender roles” would be to hav e the man do things that traditionally the woman has done and the woman to d o things that the man has traditionally done, and in a way, that's what Glady s is talking about here with Dan

and his wife. Nowadays, the most common situation i s not always the woman staying home and the man working, but both the man and the woman – both the wife and the husband, the mother and the father – w orking outside the home.

Dan says, “We don't think of it as radical.” “In fa ct,” he says, “it's quite common nowadays.” “Nowadays” (nowadays) means currently – this year or in the past five years. Dan is saying it's quite common for wom en to work outside of the home while the father stays home and takes care of the children. I don't think that's true, although it might depend on what you m ean by “common.” How common does it have to be to be considered common? I'm not really sure, but that's what Dan thinks.

Gladys says, “If you say so.” That expression, “If you say so,” is said when you don't believe what the person has just said, but yo u don't really want to argue with them. Gladys says, “Tell your wife I'd be happ y to share my recipes with her when you go back to work and she's a housewife agai n.” A “recipe” (recipe) is a set of written instructions about how to prepare a particular type of food. Normally, again, in traditional gender roles the wo man, the mother, would stay home and cook food and would use recipes.

Gladys is perhaps making a little joke here, or per haps trying to criticize Dan by saying that when Dan's wife goes back to being a ho usewife and Dan goes back to working outside of the home, then she can share recipes with the wife. I'm pretty sure she means this as a criticism of Dan an d his wife. Dan just sighs at the end. He goes (sighs), meaning he's frustrated. He decides perhaps that it's not worth continuing to argue with Gladys.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
