This episode is called “Dealing With Website Hackers,” people who go into a website to damage it or hurt it.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Valerie:  You’ll never guess what happened over the weekend.  Bill:  What?  Valerie:  Our website was attacked by hackers, and nobody could access it.    Bill:  You’re kidding!  What did they do?  Valerie:  They got access to our server and embedded some malicious code that caused the site to be redirected to their own website.  Bill:  But I thought our site had really good security.  Didn’t we hire a programmer last year to encrypt the database and patch any vulnerabilities?  Valerie:  That’s what we should have done.  So now, we’re paying the price.  Bill:  The site seems to be back up, though.  Valerie:  Yeah, we brought in a specialist on Friday and she’s been working on it 24/7.  Let’s hope she puts in the security measures we should have had all along, and this will never happen again.    Bill:  Right, at least until some creative hacker comes up with a new way to wreak havoc.
