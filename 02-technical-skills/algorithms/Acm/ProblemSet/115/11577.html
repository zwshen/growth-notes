<h2>Problem A: Letter Frequency</h2>

<font color="white"><img src="p11577.png" alt="A weird keyboard" width="400" align="right" border="5"></font>
<p>In this problem we are interested in the frequency of letters in a
given line of text. Specifically, we want to know the most frequently
occurring letter(s) in the text, ignoring case (to be clear, "letters"
refers precisely to the 26 letters of the alphabet).
</p><p>Input begins with the number of test cases on its own line.
Each test case consists of a single
line of text. The line may contain non-letter characters, but is
guaranteed to contain at least one letter and less than 200 characters
in total.
</p><p>For each test case, output a line containing the most
frequently occurring letter(s) from the text in lowercase (if there are
ties, output
all such letters in alphabetical order).
</p><h3>Sample input</h3>
<pre>1
Computers account for only 5% of the country's commercial electricity consumption.
</pre>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>co
</pre>
