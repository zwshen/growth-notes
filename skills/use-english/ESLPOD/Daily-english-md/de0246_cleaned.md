This episode is about understanding addresses of houses and buildings.  Let's get started.  > I was away from my office and needed to send some letters to clients.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have their addresses, so I called the office secretary.  Christina:  Hi, Jacob.  I need your help getting the mailing addresses for a couple of clients.  Jacob:  Sure.  Which ones?  Christina:  I need addresses for Jim Kelly and for Dr. Uemura.    Jacob:  Okay.  Jim Kelly’s address is...  Christina:  I’m sorry Jacob, but my cell phone cut out and I didn’t hear you.  Could you repeat the street address?  Jacob:  Sure.  It’s 1212 South Peabody Court, Lansing, Michigan, 48908.  Christina:  I didn’t catch the end of the address.  Did you say boulevard, avenue, or street?     Jacob:  It’s actually court, and the street number again is 1212.  Christina:  Thanks.  I’ve got that.  Could you also spell the street name?
