This episode is a dialogue about using a company to  help you run a property. Now, you might not own any property, but you will l earn some interesting vocabulary in this episode related to businesses an d renting. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Frank: What if tenants have problems?

Sonia: We are on call 24/7 and will send out someon e from our maintenance department to deal with any problems.

Sonia says to Frank, “Hello, Fickle Property Manage ment Company.” She’s answering the phone, of course. The word “property”  (property) can refer to a piece of land or a piece of land that has a buildin g on it. A “property management company” is a company, a business, that takes care of buildings such as apartment buildings and office buildings.

A property management company would be responsible for getting the rent from the people who are in the building. It would be res ponsible for fixing any problems in the building. In the United States, if you rent an apartment in a large apartment building, it’s likely that the building is run not by the people who own the building, but by another company – a property m anagement company.

Sonia works for the Fickle Property Management Comp any. This is sort of a joke. The word “fickle” (fickle) describes a person who c hanges his mind a lot, or who isn’t very loyal to one person or to an organizatio n. We might describe a fan, someone who likes a particular sports team, as bein g “fickle” if he only likes the team when the team wins. He doesn’t like the team w hen it loses. That would be a “fickle fan” – someone who changes their mind dep ending on the situation.

Frank says, “Hello, I own an office building on Bro adway Boulevard and I’m interested in hiring a property management company. ” The word “hire” here refers to signing a contract to have a business wor k for you. Sonia says, “You’ve called the right place. We help you advertise your vacant units, show empty properties, and screen prospective tenants.”

Sonia lists some of the things that a property mana gement company might do. This includes “advertising your vacant (vacant) uni ts.” The word “vacant” means empty, and is used to describe a building or a spac e within a building that is not

being rented, not being used. If you say, “We have a vacant house,” you mean you have a house that isn’t occupied, in which no o ne is living. It’s empty.

Sonia says her company will “advertise” – will let people know about – “vacant units.” The word “unit” (unit) here refers to a spa ce in a building. Sonia says her property management company, or the one she works f or, will “advertise vacant units” in a building. It will also “show (show) emp ty properties.” “To show” means to let people look at, to give people a tour of. “E mpty properties” refers to buildings or units within buildings that are empty.

Sonia also says her company will “screen prospectiv e tenants.” A “tenant” (tenant) is a person who rents either a space in a building, or an apartment in an apartment complex or apartment building. We would c all the person who is renting a “tenant.” So, if you rent your apartment,  you are a tenant. A “prospective (prospective) tenant” is someone who is thinking about renting but hasn’t rented yet. A prospective tenant would be so meone who would come and look at, say, an apartment that you are renting, an d be interested in renting it but has not yet rented it.

“To screen” (screen) someone means to determine if this person is qualified – if this person is someone to whom you would want to re nt a unit, in this case. We use this verb “to screen” in a lot of different cir cumstances. For example, a business might “screen applications” or “screen app licants” – people who want to get a job. The company will look through all the di fferent applications and decide which people it wants to interview. That’s part of the “screening process,” we might say.

Frank says that his building is “partially occupied  right now.” “To be occupied” means that there are people there in the building, renting in the building or renting spaces in the building. “To be partially (p artially) occupied” means that there are some spaces or units that are rented and some that are empty. “Partially” means not completely. You may ask someo ne if he is finished with his project, and the person may respond, “I am partiall y finished.” That means I haven’t completely finished it. I’m 50 percent or 7 5 percent finished.

Frank says he wants to make sure that “any new tena nts are financially sound.” “To be financially sound” (sound) means to have eno ugh money to, in this case, pay your rent every month. Sonia says, “That’s why we require a rental application with financial details and check their credit history.” A “rental (rental) application” is a piece of paper that you put infor mation on about who you are and how much money you have and what kind of busine ss you want to run in the rented unit.

 “Financial details” would refer to your bank accoun ts or how much money you have, what kind of business you have, and how much money the business is worth. Your “credit (credit) history” is a list of all of the loans and debt that you have. “Debt” (debt) – notice we don’t pronounce the  “b” – is money you owe other people. So if you have a credit card, you hav e “credit card debt.” You have money that you owe the credit card company. Your “c redit history” would list all of your credit cards, for example, in addition to any other loans you have.

Frank says, “Will you also draw up a rental agreeme nt?” The phrasal verb “to draw (draw) up” means to write or create a document . Usually we use this phrasal verb when we’re talking about a legal docum ent such as a contract. You may talk about “drawing up a contract” to rent a pr operty. That contract is usually called a “rental agreement.” The word “agreement” is another word for a contract.

Sonia says, “Yes, we handle,” meaning we take care of, “all of the rental details, including the deposit and delivery of keys.” A “dep osit” (deposit), sometimes called a “security deposit,” is money that you pay before you rent a home or an apartment or a unit in a commercial building that is kept by the owner in case you do any damage to the building or the apartment.

A “deposit” is money that will be given back to you  when you are no longer renting the apartment or the building or the unit. So, in the United States, for example, if you want to rent an apartment, you usua lly have to give the person or the company you are renting from your first month’s  rent, your last month’s rent, and a security deposit. Some apartments will just r equire the first month’s rent and a security deposit.

How much is the security deposit? Often it’s the sa me as the amount you pay for one month’s worth of rent. So, if you’re renting a unit for a thousand dollars a month, your security deposit will probably be aroun d a thousand dollars. That’s money that the property management company or the p erson who is renting you the property will keep until you leave the apartmen t or leave the unit. Then, if you haven’t damaged anything inside of the unit, you wi ll get that money back.

However, if you did cause any damage, the owner or management company will use that deposit to fix whatever damage you did. In  fact, sometimes it’s called a “damage deposit.” The word “damage” (damage) means physical harm that you cause something, such as a hole in the wall or some  sort of paint on the floor that shouldn’t be there. Sonia says her property managem ent company takes care of the deposit and the “delivery of keys,” meaning the  company will give whoever is

renting the apartment the keys to the apartment or the unit. In this case, it’s an office inside of an office building.

Frank asks, “What if tenants have problems?” Sonia says, “We are on call 24/7.” “To be on call” means to be available. “24/7” means  24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In other words, all the time. Sonia says that  they will send out someone from their “maintenance department to deal with,” o r take care of, “any problems.” “Maintenance” (maintenance) refers to ta king care of something so that it keeps working or fixing something if it’s b roken.

Frank says, “That sounds like what I’m looking for.  What is your fee structure?” Your “fee” (fee) is the amount of money you pay som eone, in this case, to do something. “Fee structure” (structure) refers to a list or a chart of all the different prices that you will have to pay depending on the d ifferent services or things you are asking the company to do for you. Sonia says, “ Oh, our services are very reasonable,” meaning they don’t cost very much.

Frank says, “When can you start?” Sonia says, “As s oon as you sign an agreement with us.” Frank says, “Great. Can you ema il the agreement to me right now? The building has some stopped-up toilets  that need attention ASAP!” Frank is saying that the building that he owns has some “stopped-up toilets” (toilets). A “toilet” is, of course, a place in a b athroom that you use to do what you must do in a bathroom. I think you understand what I mean, and I don’t mean showering.

If a toilet is “stopped-up,” it isn’t flushing prop erly. The water isn’t going down through the pipes properly. It “isn’t working prope rly,” we might say. “ASAP” means “as soon as possible.” Frank, in other words,  has a problem in the building that he owns, and he wants to get a proper ty management company to go and take care of it right away – ASAP.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
