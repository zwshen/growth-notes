It's about eating contaminated food, food that has somet hing wrong with it, and there's nothing happier than the subject of contami nated food. Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Rachel:  This tastes funny.

Sergey:  It’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with it.

Rachel:  It tastes like it’s tainted or something. Don’t you detect a funny metallic taste?

Sergey:  No, it’s perfectly fine. Just eat it.

Rachel:  I swear there’s something off about this f ood. I’m not eating adulterated food. There’s probably poison in here and we’re bot h going to die a terrible death.

Sergey:  There is nothing poisonous or toxic in thi s food. I made it myself.

Rachel:  Did you make sure that the milk wasn’t sou r and that none of the ingredients were spoiled? I’ll probably die from bo tulism.

Sergey:  There’s nothing spoiled, tainted, toxic, o r poisonous in this food. Are you going to eat that or not?

Rachel:  I think I’ll pass.

Sergey:  Then hand it over. I’m hungry. I’ve never met such a hypochondriac before!

Rachel:  I’m not a hypochondriac. I’m just a little  paranoid...

[end of dialogue]

Our happy dialogue begins with Rachel saying, “This  tastes funny.” You see? “Funny” – it’s already a happy dialogue. We have the word “funny.” Well, in some cases, it can mean something that makes you laugh. He’s very funny – ha, ha, ha, ha. But “funny” here, when we're talking about the ways something tastes in your mouth, means strange or unusual, usually in a bad way, meaning there's something wrong with it. It might make you sick. It  might kill you. It's a weird phrase, but we use the word funny with the verb tas te when we mean food has some unusual, usually bad taste. Sergey says, “It's  fine. There's nothing wrong with it.” There's nothing wrong with the food, Serg ey says.

Rachel, however, says, “It tastes like it's tainted  or something.” It tastes like it has the taste in my mouth of something that is “tainted ” (tainted). “Tainted” is another word for contaminated. It means something – some fo od or drink – contains something that is harmful or poisonous. It's not sa fe to eat or drink it. Rachel says, “Don’t you detect a funny metallic taste?” To  “detect” (detect) means to be able to identify the presence or existence of somet hing, to be able to tell, if you will, that it's there. Don’t you detect, can't you taste, a funny metallic taste? “Metallic” (metallic) comes from the word metal, so  something that tastes like metal, which of course is not a very nice taste.

Sergey says, “No, it's perfectly fine.” “Perfectly”  here means completely, no problem. “Just eat it,” he says to Rachel. Rachel s ays, “I swear,” meaning I believe, I really believe, “there's something off a bout this food.” When we say the food is “off” (off), we mean it's not quite right. We can use this expression, “there's something off about this television progra m” or “there's something off about the way I'm feeling.” It's not quite right. I t's wrong, but it's difficult to say exactly what the problem is. If you say there's som ething off about this food, you mean it doesn’t taste good. You're not sure what the problem is, but you know there's something wrong with it.

Rachel says, “I'm not eating adulterated food.” “Ad ulterated” (adulterated) means the same as tainted or contaminated. Usually, howev er, adulterated means that something was actually added to the product, to the  food or the drink. Someone actually put something in there that was contaminat ed. Sometimes it is done on purpose, and that’s the idea here, that someone put  something in there that

makes it not the food you think it is. Rachel says,  “There's probably poison in here and we're both going to die a terrible death.”  Didn’t I tell you this was going to be a happy dialogue? There's probably “poison” ( poison) means there's probably a substance here that will kill us or hurt  us if we eat it or drink it or perhaps even touch it. Poison is something, some su bstance, some chemical substance often, that kills you. “A terrible death”  would be a horrible way to die, a very slow and painful death might be a terrible dea th. Well, Rachel is probably not serious, but you don’t really know. Maybe there  is poison and they will die a terrible death.

Sergey says, “There is nothing poisonous or toxic i n this food. “Toxic” (toxic) is the same as poisonous. It contains some substance t hat will kill you or that will hurt you. It has something that will injure you or perhaps kill you. Sergey insists that there's nothing wrong with the food. He says, “I made it myself.” I made this food.

Rachel said, “Did you make sure that the milk wasn’ t sour and that none of the ingredients were spoiled?” “Sour” (sour) here means  gone bad. When you have a food or a drink that is not eaten quickly enough, s ometimes it will go sour. It will go bad. It will “spoil” (spoil). Well, if you put m ilk out in the sun, eventually the milk will sour. It will change so that you can't ea t it, or drink it, rather, anymore. That’s what Rachel is asking Sergey, if he used mil k that was not sour and that none of the ingredients were spoiled. “Ingredients”  are the things you use to make a certain kind of food. So if you're making la sagna, an Italian food, you would have pasta and perhaps tomato sauce and veget ables and meat and cheese. These are ingredients for that particular d ish, that particular kind of food. Rachel is asking Sergey if he made sure that none of the ingredients were spoiled. Remember “spoiled” means they’ve gone bad.  We might say they're “rotten” (rotten). When you wait too long to eat a certain kind of food, it could spoil. It would no longer be able to be eaten. That ’s the idea.

Rachel then says, “I'll probably die from botulism. ” “Botulism” (botulism) is a kind of food poisoning that can often kill you. It's cau sed by certain bacteria being in the food, things that shouldn’t be there, especiall y if you put them in a certain kind of can, or if something happens and the food s omehow gets this bacteria in it. It could kill you. It's a kind of food poisonin g. Well, that’s what Rachel says here, “I'll probably die from botulism.”

Rachel – come on, Rachel! I mean, she’s sort of wha t we would call a drama queen. A “drama queen” is someone who is always ver y dramatic about something, who always exaggerates things: “Oh, it's  so hot in here, I think I will die!” That would be kind of someone who’s a drama q ueen, someone who thinks

that something bad is going to happen to her, or so meone who – a woman – who exaggerates problems that she has, who always is ma king things worse than they actually are.

Sergey says, “There's nothing spoiled, tainted, tox ic, or poisonous in this food. Are you going to eat that or not?” Rachel says, “I think I'll pass.” “To pass” means I'm not going to do it. To decide not to do somethi ng is to pass. Sergey says, “Then hand it over.” “Hand it over” is a somewhat r ude way of saying “Give me that!” Give that thing to me. If you are being robb ed by a thief, someone has a gun and comes up to you and wants your money, he ma y say, “Hand it over!” meaning give it to me right now. That’s what Sergey  says. “Hand it over. I'm hungry. I've never met such a hypochondriac before! ” A “hypochondriac” (hypochondriac) is a person who believes that he or  she has many diseases even when they don’t have any diseases. This is the  kind of person who reads about something in the newspaper and says, “Oh, I h ave that. I have that sickness. That’s me.” And they start to feel sick e ven when there's nothing wrong with them. That’s a hypochondriac.

Rachel says, “I'm not a hypochondriac. I'm just a l ittle paranoid.” “Paranoid” (paranoid) is when you're very worried and anxious about something because you think someone else is trying to hurt you. You t hink someone else is trying to kill you or maybe just follow you around, someone w ho’s paranoid thinks everyone is trying to get him. And that’s what Rach el is, in addition to being a drama queen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rachel:  This tastes funny.

Sergey:  It’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with it.

Rachel:  It tastes like it’s tainted or something. Don’t you detect a funny metallic taste?

Sergey:  No, it’s perfectly fine. Just eat it.

Rachel:  I swear there’s something off about this f ood. I’m not eating adulterated food. There’s probably poison in here and we’re bot h going to die a terrible death.

Rachel:  I’m not a hypochondriac. I’m just a little  paranoid...

[end of dialogue]

There's nothing off about our dialogues. That’s bec ause they're written by the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.
