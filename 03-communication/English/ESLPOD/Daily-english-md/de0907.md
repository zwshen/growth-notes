This episode is a dialog about buying tools, things  you use in order to fix other things or make other things, at a hardware store, a  place where you buy tools. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialog] 

Chuck:  Just remember that we have a lot to accompl ish today, so let’s just get what we need and go, okay? 

Ayaka:  Sure, we just need a few tools for our DIY project.  The power tools are over there. 

Chuck:  Whoa, we’re not getting power tools.  We ju st need a few simple hand tools:  a hammer, a wrench, a chisel, some pliers –  and maybe an extra screwdriver or two. 

Ayaka:  We would get the job done so much more quic kly if we had power tools. Instead of a hammer, we should get a nail gun.  We also need a power drill, and hey, a sander and a table saw. 

Chuck:  A table saw?!  We’re doing some simple repa irs, not remodeling our house. 

Ayaka:  You never know when you need a good saw and  I’ve always wanted a table saw.   

Chuck:  Other women want clothes and jewelry, and y ou want power tools? 

Ayaka:  That’s right.  You should be counting your lucky stars!

Our dialog begins with Chuck saying to Ayaka, “Just  remember that we have a lot to accomplish today, so let's just get what we need and go, okay?” Chuck is telling Ayaka that they have a lot to “accomplish” today, meaning they have a lot of things they need to do today, to get done today.  He just wants to go into the store, get what they need, and leave.  

Ayaka says, “Sure. We just” – or only – “need a few  tools for our DIY project.” “DIY” is an abbreviation for the phrase, “Do It You rself.” “To do it yourself” means to build something or construct something on your o wn. If you want to table, you could buy a table or you could do a “DIY project.” a do-it-yourself project where you build the table.  

Ayaka says, “The power tools are over there.” “Powe r tools” are tools that are electric, that you plug into a wall. For example, y ou could have a power drill. That’s a kind of tool that is used to make holes in  something. “Power tools” are any tools that run on electricity. Chuck says, “Who a, we’re not getting any power tools.” That first word “whoa” is used to express s urprise. Chuck is surprised that Ayaka wants to buy some power tools.  

He says, “We just need a few simple hand tools.” A “hand tool” is something that is not electric. It's a tool that you just use your  own physical force, with your own bodily force, or power. A hammer, for example, is a  hand tool. It’s used to hit things that you need to put into, say, a piece of w ood, like a nail.  

Chuck says, “We just need a few simple hand tools: a hammer, a wrench, a chisel, some pliers – and maybe an extra screwdrive r or two. “Hammer,” we just mentioned, is a tool usually that has a wooden hand le that is you grab it by, a long piece of wood, and at the end of the wood, the re is a heavy metal part that is used to hit (usually) nails. “Nails” are small p ieces of metal that you use to attach something or to put something into a piece o f wood. That's a hammer.  

A “wrench” (wrench) is a tool made of metal. The ha ndle, the part that you grab onto with your hand, is long and narrow. On the top  of the tool, there is what looks like the letter “U” turned on its side, and y ou are able to make the “U” smaller or larger in order to fit over, say, a pipe  – a long round metal tube – that you want to turn. That's a wrench.  

A “chisel” (chisel) is a tool that has a wooden han dle and a long flat piece of metal at the other end that is sharp. It's a way of  cutting into wood, for example. There are other uses for a chisel. When we think ab out the great sculptors like  

Michelangelo, we think of someone with a hammer and  a chisel, using the chisel to remove pieces of rock from the marble so that he  can make the statue. That's another use of a chisel.  

“Pliers” (pliers) is a tool that looks a little lik e a pair of scissors. It's made of (usually) metal, and is used to grab things – not t o cut things, typically, but to grab them and turn them, or pull them.  

A “screwdriver” (screwdriver) is a tool, again usua lly made of metal, that looks like a long stick, and at one end of the stick is a  narrow piece of metal that is part of the stick. that's used to turn something called the “screw.” A “screw” is a small piece of metal that goes into a piece of wood or ot her material by turning  it. A “nail” is a small piece of metal that goes into woo d or other material by hitting  it. So, that's what a screwdriver does. It screws or pu ts than screw into a piece of wood or metal or other material.  

Ayaka says, “We would get the job done so much more  quickly if we had power tools.” Ayaka is saying, “Yes, we can buy hand tool s, but power tools would be quicker. Instead of a hammer, we should get a nail gun.” The other way of putting a nail into a piece of wood or other material is to  buy an electric tool, a power tool, called a “nail gun.” It's not a real gun. A “ nail gun” is a power tool that pushes nails into wood in a way that doesn't requir e you to pound or hit anything. It's all done by the machine. A “power drill” (dril l) is a tool used to create a narrow, deep hole in a piece of wood or metal or ot her material.  

So, Ayaka says that instead of a hammer, we should get a nail gun. “We also need a power drill, and hey, a sander and a table s aw.” Ayaka is walking around the hardware store, and she's seeing things that sh e wants to get. That's why we have this somewhat unusual expression in the middle  of the sentence, “and hey.” Here it indicates that she has just seen something and she's stopping herself in order to describe what she sees. In this case, it's  something she wants. It's a “sander.”  

A “sander” (sander) is a machine that is used to ma ke wooden surfaces, a piece of wood, smooth by rubbing or moving back and forth  something called “sandpaper.” “Sandpaper” is a piece of paper that h as small, hard objects on it, and if you rub it back and forth over a piece of wo od, the wood will become smooth. That's what a “sander” does. A “sander” is an electric power tool.  

A “table saw” is a large machine that is used to cu t long pieces of wood. A “saw” (saw) could also be a hand tool. You can have a han dsaw that you move back and forth. It's like a big knife that you’re moving  back and forth to cut something,  

such as a piece of wood. A “table saw” is a saw tha t runs on electricity that you would have in your garage or wherever you’re workin g that is used to cut long pieces of wood – or short pieces of wood, I guess. 

Chuck says, A “table saw? We’re doing some simple r epairs, not remodeling our house.” Chuck doesn't like Ayaka’s idea of buying a ll of these power tools. He says, “We’re doing some simple, some easy repairs.”  “Repairs” (repairs) are corrections or modifications to fix something, to g et something working again. If you have a refrigerator, and it stops working, you need to get it repaired. You need to fix whatever the problem is – or you can ju st buy a new refrigerator. Chuck says that they're not “remodeling” their hous e. “To remodel” (remodel) means to make major or large changes in your house.  If you are remodeling your kitchen, you might be removing all of the things in  your kitchen and basically building a new kitchen or changing things significa ntly. That's “to remodel.”  

Ayaka says, “You never know when you need a good sa w, and I've always wanted a table saw.” “You never know” means you can 't possibly anticipate when you will, in this case, need a good saw. Chuck says , “Other women want clothes and jewelry, and you want power tools?” Chuck is su rprised that Ayaka wants to buy these tools, which we might associate more trad itionally with men. Ayaka says “That's right.” That's correct. “You should be  counting your lucky stars.” “To count (count) your lucky stars” means to be very gr ateful for something that has happened, something that you don't have any control  over. What Ayaka is saying here, somewhat jokingly, is that Chuck is a very lu cky husband because his wife doesn't want to go out and spend money and buy clot hes and jewelry, like perhaps some other wives do. No, his wife just want s to buy power tools. 

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
