This episode is called “Animals in a Zoo.”  We’re g oing to talk about animals in a zoo.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Deborah:  I can’t wait to see the elephants at the zoo.  I wish I could see them in their natural habitat, but a zoo is the next best t hing. 

Zach:  I don’t want to go to a place where animals are kept in captivity.  How would you like it if you were locked in a cage and gawked at all day? 

Deborah:  The animals in zoos are lucky.  They have  a nice, safe place to live away from predators, and their handlers make sure t hey never go hungry.  Zoos preserve endangered species. 

Zach:  If you think it’s so nice living in zoos, I’ d like to see you switch places with a lion or a monkey for a month and see how you like  it. 

Deborah:  Animals aren’t people.  They don’t have t he same wants and needs. 

Zach:  That’s what you think.  One day, the animals  aren’t going to take it anymore.  They’ll rise up and break their shackles.  

Deborah:  And will you be their ringleader? 

Zach:  No, I’ll be their cheering section.  It’s ab out time animals get some respect. 

Deborah:  Have you seen Planet of the Apes ?!  I’ll reserve a cage for you! 

[end of dialogue] 

Deborah begins our dialogue by saying to Zach, “I c an’t wait to see the elephants at the zoo.”  “I can’t wait” means she’s looking fo rward to it; she wants very much to see the elephants at the zoo.  “Elephants” are l arge animals – mammals, technically.  They can typically be found in Africa  as well as in parts of Asia.  I can only think of one famous elephant, that would b e Dumbo from the Disney movie.  Elephants are large, huge animals.  They ha ve long what we call “trunks” that come from the front of their face, like a long  nose, although I think it has functions of both a nose and a mouth, at least some  of them.  Anyway, Deborah wants to see elephants at the zoo.  The “zoo” is a park where there are many animals.  The animals are usually kept in container s we would call “cages.”  They are put in cages in part so they don’t leave, and i n part to protect the people who are looking at them.  Deborah says, “I wish I could  see them (the elephants) in their natural habitat, but a zoo is the next best t hing.”  Your “habitat” (habitat) refers to a place where you live.  “Natural habitat ” for an animal would be the places where you would find them out in the world, not inside of a man-made cage or zoo.  Deborah says, “a zoo is the next best  thing.”  When we say something is “the next best thing” we mean it’s not  the best option – the best possibility, but it’s the second best. 

Zach says, “I don’t want to go to a place where ani mals are kept in captivity.” The expression “in captivity” (captivity) means tha t you are held in a certain place and you can’t leave.  If you are a prisoner you may  be said to be held in captivity. Normally we use the expression when talking about a nimals, however.  Animals who are put into cages could be said to be held in captivity or kept in captivity. Zach says, “How would you like it if you were locke d in a cage and gawked at all day?”  Zach doesn’t like zoos; he doesn’t like the fact that the animals are put in cages, so he asks Deborah, “How would you like it i f you were put in a cage.”  A “cage,” as we mentioned, is a large box usually wit h metal bars that prevent the animal inside from leaving.  He asks Deborah how sh e would feel if she were being gawked at all day.  “To gawk (gawk) at (someo ne)” is to stare at them, to look at them for a long time, but sort of in a stup id way, often with your mouth open because it’s so weird – it’s so unusual.  It’s  considered rude or impolite to gawk at people, to look at them, and that’s what Za ch is saying.  To look at someone in such a way as though they were an animal , that would be considered rude.  Sometimes we talk about tourists who come to Los Angeles gawking at celebrities that they might see, famous people, staring at them, looking at them, pointing at them.  That’s somethin g that people who live in Los Angeles usually don’t do, not because they’re not e xcited to see famous people, but because the general rule here is that you don’t  stop a famous person and ask them for their autograph or try to talk to them.  T ypically, you just leave them  

alone.  You pretend like you see famous people ever y day and it’s really not that important that you’re seeing them.   

Well, Zach doesn’t like zoo; he doesn’t want to go gawk at animals.  Deborah says, however, that the animals in zoos are lucky –  they’re fortunate.  “They have a nice, safe place to live away from predators.”  “ Predators” (predators) here refer to animals that hunt and eat other animals.  If an animal is in a zoo, it doesn’t have to worry about being eaten by predator s.  Deborah says that the animals’ handlers make sure they never go hungry.  A “handler” (handler) in this dialogue means a zookeeper, the person whose job it  is to take care of the animals in the zoo.  Deborah says the handlers make  sure that the animals never go hungry; they always have food to eat.  “Zoos,” s he says, “preserve endangered species.”  A “species” is a type of anim al.  “Endangered” means that it’s possible that the species – the animals of tha t type – might not survive, that we might kill all of them.  “Endangered species” ar e animals that are in danger because if we don’t protect them there may not be a ny of them anymore.  This happens often when animals are hunted, are caught o r shot with a gun by humans, of course.  Or if something disturbs their habitat – if something changes the place where they’re living they may go extinct.   “To go extinct” (extinct) means that they will no longer exist, that all of t hem will die.  That’s an endangered species, a species that is not extinct b ut is in danger of becoming extinct. 

Zach says, “If you think it’s so nice living in zoo s, I’d like to see you (Deborah) switch places with a lion or a monkey for a month a nd see how you like it.”  “To switch places” means to go in the place of someone else, to exchange your place for his place.  Zach is saying that she should swit ch places with a “lion,” which is a very large, cat-like animal.  And because it’s ca t-like, you probably can guess I don’t really like lions!  Zach mentions monkeys.  “ Monkeys” are small, human-like animals, we could say.  They have long arms and leg s, and they can go and hold onto things with their hands.  They can swing, we w ould say, jump from tree to tree for example. 

Deborah says, “Animals aren’t people.  They don’t h ave the same wants and needs.”  Zach says, “That’s what you think.”  That expression, “that’s what you think,” means I disagree with you.  You think that but you don’t know the truth, that’s what the expression is trying to communicate  here.  Zach says, “One day, the animals aren’t going to take it anymore,” meani ng they’re not going to tolerate, they’re not going to permit, they’re not going to stand being in cages. They’re going to get mad, if you will, and they’re going to break out of their cages – leave them.  Zach says, “They’ll rise up and brea k their shackles.”  “To rise up” is a phrasal verb meaning to fight against the peop le or the organizations with  

authority that have been treating you badly.  When you have a revolution, the people rise up; they get rid of the government they  have now.  “Shackles” (shackles) are things that you put on a prisoner’s feet so they won’t run away. “To break your shackles” means to take these off so  you can escape – you can run away.  Zach is saying that the animals are goin g to rise up and break their shackles, meaning they’re going to get their freedo m from the zoo. 

Deborah says, “And will you be their ringleader?”  She’s asking Zach if he will be the person who leads these animals.  A “ringleader”  is usually someone who is the responsible person for a revolution or a rebell ion.  Zach says, “No, I’ll be their cheering section.”  “To cheer” (cheer) here means t o encourage, by yelling or shouting or clapping your hands, some team, usually  a sports team that you want to win a game.  But in this case, the “cheering sec tion” refers to people who would support a certain activity.  They’re not doin g it themselves, but they are encouraging other people to do it, and that’s what Zach would do if the animals rose up and broke their shackles, as he says.  He s ays, “It’s about time animals get some respect.”  “It’s about time” means now is the time, it has been too long, we should be giving animals now some respect. 

Deborah says, “Have you seen Planet of the Apes ?!”  Planet of the Apes  is a movie – a 1968 movie with a famous actor named Char lton Heston.  In the movie the animals, specifically the apes which is a kind of animal similar to a monkey, not exactly the same, who are ruling the planet.  T he apes are now in control and the humans are the ones who are in the cages.  Debo rah asks if Zach has seen this movie, because in the movie the humans don’t g et very good treatment, that’s why she says at the end, “I’ll reserve a cag e for you!”  “To reserve” means to set aside, to say this person can use it at this  time.  But Deborah is really saying that if the animals rise up – if the animals  take over the world humans will not be treated very well and Zach will have to be i n a cage just like the animals are now.  It won’t be a very happy situation she sa ys. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
