This podcast is called “Showing Disapproval and Sympathy.”  It’s a dialogue between Maggie and Joe about someone who is going to lose their job.  They’re going to use a lot of vocabulary we might use when you don’t like something – “to disapprove,” as well as to show sympathy to someone.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Maggie:  Why the long face?  Joe:  I just heard that I won’t be rehired for next year.  Maggie:  That’s awful!  What a rotten thing for the management to do.    Joe:  I’ll be okay, but Monica is losing her job, too.    Maggie:  Oh no, not Monica, too.  I’m so sorry to hear that.  Who do they think they are?  How can they treat us this way?  Joe:  They’re management and they can do whatever they want to.  Monica just bought a new house and I’m sure she’s going to have to sell it.  Maggie:  That’s really too bad.  Listen, I know you’ll be dead set against the rest of us pulling together to talk to the management, but I think the time has come.    Joe:  I won’t let you or anyone else around here put your jobs on the line to try to save ours.  The management will definitely take a dim view of us workers trying to speak out.  Just lay low and hope that you won’t lose your job, too.
