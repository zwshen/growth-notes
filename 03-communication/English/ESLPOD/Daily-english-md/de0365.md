[start of dialogue]  Andrea:  It’s your turn to put the kids to bed.    Marlon:  No, I put them to bed last night, didn’t I?  Andrea:  Nope, I did that.  Don’t forget their bedtime story.  Marlon:  The kids won’t let me forget it.  Okay, time for bed!  Go brush your teeth and put on your pajamas.  It’s lights out in 15 minutes.  Andrea:  What are you doing?  Marlon:  I’m finishing my newspaper.  Andrea:  Aren’t you going to watch over them to make sure they’re getting ready for bed?  Marlon:  Nope.  You have your methods and I have mine.  Andrea:  Okay, this I’ve got to see.  Marlon:  I don’t hear anyone brushing their teeth.  If everyone isn’t in bed in five minutes, they’re going to get a cuddle from Norman.
