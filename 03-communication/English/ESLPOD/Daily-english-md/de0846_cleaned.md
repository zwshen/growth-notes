This episode is a dialog between Michelle and Gabri el about donating or giving some of your blood to people who need it. Let’s get  started! 

[start of dialog] 

Michelle:  Did you hurt yourself?   

Gabriel:  No, why? 

Michelle:  You have a Band-Aid on your arm. 

Gabriel:  Oh, that. I donated blood today.   

Michelle:  You did? That’s great. I’d like to donat e blood, but every time I get close to a needle, I feel light-headed. I’m afraid if I go through with it, and they actually draw blood, I’ll faint. 

Gabriel:  I’m used to it. I give blood all the time . The needle doesn’t bother me.   

Michelle:  That’s very admirable. I know how import ant it is for hospitals to have a good supply of blood for use in transfusions. 

Gabriel:  I don’t mind doing it. It’s not a big dea l. 

Michelle:  But it is a big deal. If relief organiza tions didn’t have enough blood when they traveled to disaster areas, they couldn’t  help the injured people there. I’m sure that’s why you do it, right? 

Gabriel:  Well...  

 Michelle:  Well, what?   

Gabriel:  There is a particularly pretty nurse who works in the bloodmobile... 

Michelle:  Ah.

Michelle begins by saying to Gabriel, “Did you hurt  yourself?” Gabriel says, “No, why?” Michelle says, “You have a Band-Aid on your a rm.” A “Band-Aid” (band- aid) is actually the name of a product of a company  here in the United States. It’s a bandage. It’s a small piece of cotton that has a piece of tape on it that you put over a cut on your skin. So, if you cut your finger  and it’s bleeding – blood is coming out – you might put a Band-Aid on it. That i s a bandage. We say “Band- Aid” even when it’s not the bandage made by that co mpany. We have another similar term “Kleenex” (Kleenex), which is basicall y tissue paper you use to blow your nose, to clean out the inside of your nose, if  you will. We say “Kleenex” even though that’s technically just one company’s tissue  paper.  

Michelle is asking if Gabriel hurt himself because he has a Band-Aid on his arm. Gabriel says, “Oh, that. I donated blood today.” “T o donate blood” means to give some of your blood to a hospital or to an organizat ion like the Red Cross, to help people who need blood. When you get hurt or sick an d go to a hospital, often they need to give you more blood. Where do they get  the blood? From people who donated.  

Michelle says, “You did? That’s great! I’d like to donate blood but every time I get close to a needle, I feel light-headed.” “Needle” ( needle) is that long, sharp thing they put inside of your body. They basically put a hole in your skin in order to get the blood out. You also use a needle for putting so mething into your body, like a drug. “Light-headed” is the same as dizzy, a feelin g that you may fall down. It feels like the world is spinning around you. That’s  to feel light-headed.  

Michelle says, “I’m afraid if I go through with it and they actually draw blood, I’ll faint.” “To go through with something” means to do something that is, perhaps, difficult or even a little dangerous. But you go ah ead and do it anyway. You have the courage, the strength to do this difficult thin g. Michelle is afraid that if she goes through with it – if she actually goes to a pl ace to donate her blood – “and they actually draw blood,” meaning they actually ta ke blood out of her, “I’ll faint.” “To faint” (faint) is to, basically, lose conscious ness. You fall asleep. If you are standing, fall down and become unconscious, typical ly, for a short period of time.   

 I’ve only fainted once in my life. I was…yeah, that  was a long time ago. I was sitting at a chair and someone was rubbing my neck.  I know it sounds a little weird. But someone was rubbing my neck and it was s o relaxing that I fainted. I can remember that very well. It was probably 25 yea rs ago. Well, some people faint when they hear bad news. Some people faint wh en they see something they don’t like, like blood.  

Michelle is afraid that she’ll faint if she actuall y goes and donates blood. Gabriel says – because he’s a man – “I’m used to it. I give  blood all the time. The needle doesn’t bother me,” meaning it doesn’t cause me any  problems. Michelle says, “That’s very admirable.” Something that is “admirab le” (admirable) is something that is impressive, something that other people res pect, other people realize is important. Michelle says, “I know how important it is for hospitals to have a good supply of blood for use in transfusions.” “Transfus ions” are when a doctor at a hospital, typically, will be giving you new blood. They are transferring someone else’s blood into your body, for some medical reaso n.  

Gabriel says, “I don’t mind doing it.” “I don’t min d” means it doesn’t bother me. It’s not a problem. He says, “It’s not a big deal,”  meaning it’s nothing that’s very important, nothing that causes any trouble. Michell e then says, “It is a big deal.” Here, “big deal” means something important, somethi ng makes a difference. She says, “If relief organizations didn’t have enough b lood when they travelled to disaster areas, they couldn’t help the injured peop le there. “Relief organizations” are organizations like the Red Cross or the Red Cre scent that go into areas where people are suffering, perhaps because of a wa r or a hurricane or some other natural disaster, some other terrible event, and they help people in those areas. They give them food, water, and so forth.  

Michelle says, “If relief organizations didn’t have  enough blood when they travelled to disaster areas, they couldn’t help the  injured people there.” A “disaster (disaster) area” is an area where somethi ng very bad has happened – a war, a hurricane, an earthquake, that sort of thing . “To help injured people” means to help people who are hurt. “To be injured” (injured) means that you are hurt. You have some part of your body that has been  hurt or been damaged, maybe you broke your leg, maybe you’ve been cut – w hatever the injury is.  

Michelle says, “I’m sure that’s why you do it, righ t?” She’s saying to Gabriel, I’m sure the reason you donate your blood is to help pe ople who need help, these relief organizations, for example. Gabriel says, “W ell…” Michelle says, “Well what?” He doesn’t seem to want to give the real ans wer and then he does. He says, “There is a particularly pretty nurse who wor ks in the bloodmobile.” Now,  

we find out why Gabriel goes and donates his blood.  It’s not because he wants to be a good person. It’s because there’s an attractiv e, a physically attractive, good- looking nurse in the bloodmobile.  

A “nurse” (nurse) is a professional who helps docto rs. Many nurses, most nurses, are female, in most countries. But there’re also, o f course, male nurses. But male nurses are the exception. In fact, typically, if yo u are a nurse who is male, we’ll often use the expression “male nurse” so that peopl e know that you’re not a woman. Of course, if they saw you, they probably kn ow you’re not a woman, but you know what I mean.  

Well, Gabriel happens to like a pretty nurse who wo rks in the “bloodmobile.” The “bloodmobile” (bloodmobile) – one word – is a large  van or truck that travels around from place to place and inside of it. It has  equipment needed so that you can donate blood. “Bloodmobiles” are very popular i n the United States. They go to buildings or to big events and allow people to d onate blood so they don’t have to go to a hospital or to a doctor’s office. Michel le now understands why Gabriel wants to donate blood so often. He wants to go and talk to the pretty nurse. The question is, does the pretty nurse want to talk to Gabriel?  

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
