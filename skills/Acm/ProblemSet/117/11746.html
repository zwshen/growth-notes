<h2>Problem E: Finding the Transmitter Again</h2>

<font color="white"><img src="p11746.jpg" width="400" align="right" border="5"></font>
<p>SOS! Your boss has misplaced an important (and expensive) radio
transmitter somewhere in a large, rectangular cornpatch. He refuses to
explain why he took the transmitter out into the cornpatch, but he has
tasked you with finding it. Thankfully, he has already set up three
radio receivers in the cornpatch to help you narrow down the possible
locations to search.
</p>
<p>The receivers are designed in such a way that they can only measure
the signal strength at their location, and not which direction it is
coming from. Furthermore, they are too large to easily move.
</p>
<p>You know that for this particular model of transmitter, the signal strength at a positive distance <em>d</em> is given by the expression <em>P/d<sup>2</sup></em>, where <em>P</em>
is the power level of the transmitter. Unfortunately, you don't know
what power level the transmitter is currently set to, only that it is
positive.
</p>
<p>Write a program that reads as input the locations and readings of
the receivers, and outputs a list of possible locations of the
transmitter.
</p>
<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>The input begins with a number <em>N</em> on a single line, followed by <em>N</em> testcases.
</p>
<p>Each testcase consists of three lines, each containing the location (as two integers <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> <em>y<sub>i</sub></em>) and power reading (as an integer <em>p<sub>i</sub></em>) from one of the receivers.  You are assured that 0 ≤ <em>x<sub>i</sub></em>, <em>y<sub>i</sub></em> ≤ 1,000, 0 &lt; <em>p<sub>i</sub></em> ≤ 100,000, and that the receivers are located at three distinct points.
</p>
<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>For each testcase, output one line containing first the number of
possible locations of the transmitter, followed by the possible
locations themselves (in the form <em>x<sub>t</sub></em> <em>y<sub>t</sub></em>).  A location is possible if it is within the cornpatch (0 ≤ <em>x<sub>t</sub></em>, <em>y<sub>t</sub></em> ≤ 1,000), and a transmitter there could produce the given receiver readings for some positive power level <em>P</em>.
</p>
<p>The output coordinates should be rounded to exactly two decimal
places, and multiple output locations should be sorted by increasing
x-coordinate, breaking ties by increasing y-coordinate. You are
guaranteed that the input data will determine a finite, non-zero number
of possible locations. Furthermore, the input will be such that a small
perturbation (on the order of 10<sup>-6</sup>) in the receiver positions would not change the number of possible locations.
</p>
