This episode is a dialogue between Sadie and Gordon  about going to everyone’s favorite destination, everyone’s favorite place: the dentist’s office. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sadie: Hi, I’m Sadie. You must be Gordon.

Gordon: Yes, I am. It’s nice to meet you. It’s a li ttle strange to be set up, isn’t it?

Sadie: It was nice of Felina and Jaime to arrange t his date.

Gordon: It was. Jaime told me that you’re a dentist . Is that right?

Sadie: Yes.

Gordon: That must be interesting work.

Sadie: Well, I think so. Just today, I did a root c anal and removed a set of wisdom teeth. Oh, but you wouldn’t want to hear abo ut that.

Gordon: Sure, I do. I want to get to know you bette r.

Sadie: In that case, since I live in a small town, I do basic dental work, but also act as a periodontist, oral surgeon, and orthodonti st when the need arises.

Gordon: Wow, that’s a lot of dental knowledge to ke ep up on.

Sadie: I don’t mind. One day, it’s cavities and cro wns, and the next, extractions, bridgework, dentures, implants, and inlays. I had a  very interesting case the other day…

Gordon: Go on.

Sadie: It’s a little unpleasant, maybe not good din ner conversation.

Gordon: Maybe you’re right. It’s not always a good idea to talk shop over dinner.

Sadie: Felina didn’t mention what you did for a liv ing.

Gordon: I’m a proctologist.

Sadie: Ah, I see your point.

Our dialogue begins with Sadie saying to Gordon, “H i, I’m Sadie. You must be Gordon.” Gordon says, “Yes, I am. It’s nice to meet  you. It’s a little strange to be set up, isn’t it?” “To be set (set) up” is to have someone arrange for you to meet another person in whom you might be romantically in terested. “To set two people up” is to arrange a situation where both of them ca n be together and go out, usually on a date. That seems to be what’s happenin g for Sadie and Gordon.

Sadie says, “It was nice of Felina and Jaime to arr ange this date.” “To arrange” here means to plan and make happen this date. A “da te” (date) here means a romantic appointment – a meeting of two people who are romantically interested in each other, or who might be. Gordon agrees with Sadie that it was nice of their friends to set up this date for the two of them. “J aime told me that you’re a dentist,” Gordon says. “Is that right?” A “dentist”  (dentist) is a doctor who works on your teeth in your mouth, of course. Sadie says, “Yes,” meaning yes, I am a dentist.

Gordon says, “That must be interesting work.” Sadie  says, “Well, I think so. Just today I did a root canal and removed a set of wisdo m teeth.” A “root (root) canal (canal)” is a special kind of dental procedure wher e the dentist goes in and removes part of the root of a tooth and puts in usu ally some other sort of substance to protect it. A root canal can be very p ainful – or at least, if you need a root canal, the pain leading up to the root canal  can be quite severe. Sometimes people say jokingly about an experience that was very painful, “It was like having a root canal.”

 A “set of wisdom teeth” refers to teeth that are us ually in the very back of your mouth. They are called “molars” (molars). I say the y are usually in the back of your mouth. They’re always in the back of your mout h – I’m sure. These teeth often begin to grow and “come in,” we would say, af ter your other teeth have already developed, and sometimes it’s necessary to remove the wisdom teeth in order to have enough room in your mouth, unless you ’re like me and you have a really big mouth. But for a lot of people, the dent ist will remove wisdom teeth.

Anyway, Sadie and Gordon are on this date and Sadie  starts talking about her work as a dentist, and then she says, “Oh, but you don’t want to hear about that.” Gordon says, “Sure, I do. I want to get to know you  better.” Aww, isn’t that nice? Gordon knows how to say the right thing, right guys ? Anyway, Sadie says, “In that case,” meaning well if that’s true, “since I l ive in a small town, I do basic dental work but also act as a periodontist, oral su rgeon, and orthodontist when the need arises.”

Sadie says she lives in a small town, and if it is a small town, there may not be many dentists there – and that seems to be the case , because in addition to doing regular dental work, Sadie says she also acts  “as a periodontist.” “To act (act) as” something or someone is to do a certain s ervice or perform a certain service or, we might say, “fill a particular role.”  If you act as someone’s advisor, you are giving them advice and suggestions. Well, S adie says she sometimes acts as a “periodontist.”

What, you ask, is a “periodontist” (periodontist)? A periodontist is a dentist who specializes in improving the health of the bones an d the structures that hold the teeth in place. So, your teeth, of course, obviousl y go into the part of your body called the “jaw,” which is on the bottom of your fa ce. A periodontist would be a dentist who is very knowledgeable and specializes in taking care of the place where the teeth go into your mouth – your “gums” (g ums) – and other parts of the structure of the jaw.

An “oral surgeon,” which is also one of the things that Sadie says she does, is a person who specializes in cutting open the mouth an d the jaws in surgery. A “surgeon” (surgeon) is a general term for a doctor that takes a knife and usually cuts a hole in you in order to make you better – at  least, we hope they make you better. Because Sadie lives in a small town, not on ly does she sometimes do work related to the work of a periodontist and an o ral surgeon, but she also acts as an “orthodontist.”

An “orthodontist” (orthodontist) is a dentist who make sure that your teeth are straight,  that they stand in a straight line – usu ally so that your teeth look better, although sometimes people need to have their teeth straightened because they’re so crooked it causes other problems. It’s n ot unusual for parents to take their teenagers to an orthodontist if their teeth a re somehow not quite straight, and that just happens naturally. It’s not that the teenager has done anything wrong.

Gordon says, “Wow, that’s a lot of dental knowledge  to keep up on.” The phrasal verb “to keep up on” something means to be informed  about, to have the latest news about. We of course want our doctors and denti sts to keep up on the latest research – the latest and most current information about what they do – so they give us the best possible treatments. Sadie says, “ I don’t mind,” meaning I am not bothered by the fact that I have to keep up on all these different areas of dentistry.

She says, “One day its cavities and crowns, and the  next extractions, bridgework, dentures, implants, and inlays.” There’s a lot of s pecialized vocabulary in that sentence. Let’s go back and very briefly explain wh at it all means. Let’s start with “cavities” (cavities). Cavities are small holes in your teeth that sometimes the dentist has to fill in order to make sure there are n’t further problems in the future with your teeth.

A “crown” (crown) is normally something that a king  or queen wears on top of his or her head. However, you could also put a crown on  your tooth, which is basically something that covers your tooth. Many cr owns are permanent, meaning once it’s on, it stays on. “Extractions” (e xtractions) refer to when a dentist has to remove some of your teeth from your mouth. The verb is “to extract,” which means to take something out of. Usu ally it’s a difficult process, but not always.

“Bridgework” is when a dentist creates artificial o r, basically, false teeth that are then attached to your regular teeth. “Bridgework” r efers to putting in the false teeth, the artificial teeth. “Dentures” (dentures) refer to the actual false teeth. “Bridgework” refers to the work the dentist does to  attach the false teeth. The “dentures” are the actual false teeth themselves, a nd usually dentures are teeth that you put into and take out of your mouth.

An “implant” (implant) refers to something that goe s inside of your body, in this case we’re talking about a tooth.  Although women –  some women, especially here in Los Angeles – have other kinds of things th ey put in the upper part of their body which are called “implants.” But we’re n ot here to talk about that.

Finally, “inlay” (inlay) is a substance that is put  on the surface or the outer part of the tooth in order to fill a hole. That’s one way that a dentist might prevent further damage to your teeth if you have a holes in them.

Gordon is interested in what Sadie has to say. Sadi e says, however, that all of this talk of dental work is a little unpleasant – “ maybe not good dinner conversation,” she says. Gordon says, “Maybe you’re  right,” – maybe that’s true. “It’s not always a good idea to talk shop over dinn er.” “To talk shop” (shop) has nothing to do with going out and buying things in a  store. Instead, it refers to talking about your work when you’re not at work – w hen you are at home or with friends or family. “To talk shop” is to talk about work outside of the normal times when you are working.

That’s what Gordon is saying here – that it’s proba bly not a good idea for them, on this romantic date, to talk about their work. Sa die says, “Felina didn’t mention what you did for a living.” In other words, Sadie wants to know what Gordon does, what his job is. Gordon says, “I’m a proctolo gist.” A “proctologist” (proctologist) is a doctor who specializes in probl ems of the rectum and “anus” (anus).

Now, this is one I’m going to let you look up on yo ur own on the Internet, because I know that Dr. Tse put this word in the sc ript so that I would have to explain it, but this is one of those rare cases whe re I would like you to go onto your computer and put in “proctologist” (proctologi st) and “anus” (anus) and you will get that definition all by yourself. I know yo u can do it, so just go ahead and do it, and then I’ve done my job and you’ve done yo urs.

But if you really don’t want to do that, a proctolo gist has to do with things related to your butt – to that part of the body that you si t on. See? Now you know why I don’t want to talk about it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sadie: Hi, I’m Sadie. You must be Gordon.

Gordon: Yes, I am. It’s nice to meet you. It’s a li ttle strange to be set up, isn’t it?

Gordon: I’m a proctologist.

Sadie: Ah, I see your point.

[end of dialogue]

Listening to today’s script was nothing like having  a root canal. It was just the opposite – at least, I hope it was.
