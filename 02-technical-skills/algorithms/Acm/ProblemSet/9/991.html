<h1>Safe Salutations</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
As any minimally superstitious person knows all too well, terrible
things will happen when four persons do a crossed handshake.
</p>
<p>
You, an intrepid computer scientist, are given the task of easing the
burden of these people by providing them with the feasible set of
handshakes that include everyone in the group while avoiding any such
crossings. The following figure illustrates the case for 3 pairs of
persons:

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
The input to this problem contains several datasets separated by a blank line. Each dataset is simply an integer <i>n</i>, the number of
<b>pairs</b> of people in the group, with 1 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 10.
</p>


<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
The output is equally simple. For each dataset, print a single integer indicating the number
of possible crossless handshakes that involve everyone in a group
with <i>n</i> pairs of people. Print a blank line between datasets.
