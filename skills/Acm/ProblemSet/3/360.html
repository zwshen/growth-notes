<P>
Billy Bee has big ideas. He wants to use an abandoned level of the beehive as
a ``fun-house maze.&quot; The idea is to sell tickets and make big bucks. 
The sample below is ``rectangular&quot; and has eleven rows and twelve columns. Billy's maze
will also be rectangular, and similarly shaped, but might have different
dimensions.  The cells are identified by a sequence of numbers, starting
with 1, in the pattern shown. The maze comes from the fact that many
adjacent cells have
openings between them. There are also two openings to the outside:  an
entrance and an exit.
<P>
<center><img src=360img3.gif></center>
<P>
You can assume that the cells in the maze are oriented as shown above
(horizontal and slanted sides, but no vertical sides), and
that the second row of the maze starts below and to the right
of the first room in the maze.
<P>
<P>
Billy has already set up his maze, but he is not very smart
and can't solve it for himself. He has hired you to help him find a path
through his maze (or, if his maze has no solution, to inform
him of the fact). In your own quest for big bucks,
you decide to develop a computer program to solve such
``rectangular hexagonal mazes&quot; by the well known
<I>right-hand rule</I> and charge Billy Bee for
the development costs.  Then you'll turn around and sell the
software to Bill Gates, hoping you don't get stung in the process.
<P>
<P>
The righthand rule states that, when you enter a planar
maze, if you place your right hand on the entrance wall, and then walk
forth, never removing the hand from the wall, you will eventually
exit the maze through the exit door (or, if the exit is
inaccessible, you will exit through the entrance door).
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The input file will contain zero or more maze descriptions, immediately
following one another.
<P>
<P>
The first line of each maze description will contain
two positive integers,  <I>r</I> and <I>c</I>, (<i>r<=30, c<=30</i>)
separated by a space, indicating, respectively,
the number of rows and columns in the maze. Alternatively,
the line may contain just two zeroes, separated by a space,
indicating that there are no more mazes to read and solve.
<P>
The second line of each maze description will also contain
two positive integers, separated by a space, indicating
the room number and wall number, respectively, of the maze's
entrance. (Walls of each room are assumed to be numbered
clockwise, starting from <I>topwall</I>=1.)
<P>
The third line will identify the room number and wall
number of the maze's exit in the same manner.
The entrance and exit to the maze are different doors.
<P>
The remaining lines each describe a room in the
maze.  Each of these lines contains a room number,
followed by from one to six integers, each in the
range 1 to 6, inclusive, separated by single spaces.
The integers following the room numbers indicate the
walls containing openings,
and may be in any order, as may be the lines themselves.
Rooms will not be repeated in a data set. Rooms not listed in a data set
have no doors (for example, room 60 in the sample data).
<P>
The end of the maze description is indicated by a
line containing only the integer 0.  The line
after that either begins the next maze description, or
contains the two zeroes that indicate the end of data.
<P>
<P>
Your program may assume the data to be valid and consistent. The maze shown in the picture would be described using the following Sample Input data.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
First, the program should list the sequence of rooms
encountered during the search for a solution,
twenty rooms per line (except possibly the final line),
with values on the same line separated by a single
space.  Note that the last room listed will either be
the exit room (if a solution was found)
or the entrance room (otherwise).
<P>
Second, the line immediately below the final line of the
search path should contain either the phrase <TT>SOLUTION FOUND</TT>
or else the phrase <TT>NO SOLUTION</TT>, corresponding to whether or not
a path from the entrance to the exit was found.
<P>
