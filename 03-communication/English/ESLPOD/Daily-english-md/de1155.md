The topic of this episode is getting an online degr ee – getting a college degree from a college on the Internet. Sounds cool. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Carlos: So where are you planning on attending coll ege? 

Torrie: I’ve picked Harford University. 

Carlos: The only Harford University I’ve heard of i s a degree mill. 

Torrie: I’m sure it’s not the same one. The Harford  University I’m attending is accredited, at least I’m pretty sure it is. The bes t part of going to Harford is I’ll never have to attend classes on campus. I can do al l of my coursework online. 

Carlos: You want to attend an online university? Th ere are some legitimate ones that offer good distance education, but many have l ow admissions standards and don’t provide a very good education. 

Torrie: Not Harford. It’s a good degree-granting in stitution, and they even give you credit for relevant life experience. I won’t ne ed to take very many courses to graduate. 

Carlos: That sounds pretty fishy to me.  

Torrie: Don’t worry. My transcript and degree will be indistinguishable from those from a traditional university, without nearly as mu ch work.  

 Carlos: That should tell you something. How is thei r job placement rate? 

Torrie: I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be a s competitive as any other college graduate. 

Carlos: If you say so. What are you doing right now ? 

Torrie: I’m playing a video game stealing cars. At Harford, that’s considered relevant life experience. Cool, huh? 

Carlos: Yeah, cool.

Carlos says to Torrie, “So where are you planning o n attending college?” “To attend (attend) college” means to be a student at a  college, to go to a university. Torrie says, “I’ve picked Harford University.” “To pick” (pick) means to select, to choose. Carlos says, “The only Harford University I ’ve heard of is a degree mill.” A “degree” (degree) is what you get after you compl ete a course of study at a university. If you study for four years, you usuall y get a bachelor’s degree.  

A “degree mill” (mill), however, is actually a busi ness that sells degrees, basically. It looks like a college or university on  the Internet, or in the newspaper, but really it just gives out degrees – pieces of pa per – without you having to do very much. Torrie says, “I’m sure it’s not the same  one.” She’s sure that the Harford University she’s going to study at isn’t a degree mill.  

She says, “The Harford University I’m attending is accredited, at least I’m pretty sure it is.” For a university to be “accredited” (a ccredited) means that some professional organization, some professional associ ation, has examined the college and determined that it meets certain standa rds. Who runs this organization? Well, the colleges that accredit them selves. It’s an interesting system. Anyway, in the United States, most people t ry to get a degree from an accredited university because it’s recognized, righ tly or wrongly, as having a certain level of quality.  

Torrie says, “The best part of going to Harford is I’ll never have to attend classes on campus.” A “campus” (campus) is the land and the  buildings that a college or university has. Some colleges have more than one ca mpus. They have buildings and land in different parts of the city, or even a state or country. Torrie says that she will not have to “attend,” or go to, “classes o n campus.” She says, “I can do  

all of my coursework online.” “Coursework” (coursew ork) – one word – here just means classes, the classes that you are taking. Car los says, “You want to attend an online university?”  

An “online university” is a university that offers all or most of its classes over the Internet. This isn’t really a new idea, in the sens e that colleges and universities and schools sometimes offered classes before the In ternet using what we would call “correspondence courses.” They would mail thin gs to you and you would read the books and take the tests and then mail the m back to the university. So, the idea of getting an education without actually g oing to a school building or going on campus isn’t completely new.  

Carlos says, “There are some legitimate ones,” mean ing legitimate online universities, “that offer good distance education, but many have low admissions standards and don’t provide a very good education.”  “Legitimate” (legitimate) means real or not false, not fake – “valid,” we mig ht say. A “legitimate university” is one that does what a university is supposed to d o.  

“Distance education” is a general term that refers to any kind of education or coursework that is done without you going to a scho ol’s campus. Distance education could involve video education – having vi deo courses, or even seeing a lecture by a professor over the Internet on live video. It could include sending things in the mail. It could include going to a web site. All of these are kinds of distance education. Carlos warns, however, that man y of these online universities have low admissions standards.  

“Admissions standards” refers to the requirements t hat you have to have in order to get into a college, university, or school. To ha ve “low admissions standards” means it’s not very difficult to get into the schoo l. Again, people associate the difficulty of getting into a college with the quali ty of that college. I don’t think that’s always the case, but that’s what people think, just  like people think accredited universities are somehow better than unaccredited u niversities. That might be true in general, but it isn’t always true. Anyway, I’m giving my own opinions here. Let’s get back to the story.  

Torrie says that Harford it is not one of these uni versities that has low admissions standards. She says, “It’s a good degree-granting i nstitution.” “Degree-granting institutions” are ones that, well, give you a degre e, such as a bachelor’s degree or some other kind of degree. Torrie says, “They ev en give you credit for relevant life experience.”  

There are two kinds of classes you can take at a un iversity or college. One is a “credit (credit) class.” The other is a “non-credit  class.” A “credit class” is a class that counts towards, or is included in, the total n umber of classes that you need to take in order to graduate. Most universities ass ign, or give, classes a certain number of credits. You need a certain number of cre dits then to graduate. You could take a class that gives you five credits – us ually that’s a class that meets more or has more class time and is more work than a  class that is only three credits.  

To graduate from a university or college in the Uni ted States usually requires I think around 180 credits or so, more or less. The n umber is arbitrary in a way, but the university needs a way of determining how m uch education you are getting, and it needs some sort of standard to dete rmine how much is enough to get a degree. A “non-credit class” is a class that you take but doesn’t count toward your degree – that is, the university won’t include those credits when it counts up the number that you need to graduate, to get a degree.  

Torrie says that Harford University gives you credi t for “relevant (relevant) life experience.” “Relevant” means it’s related to or is  significant for some particular purpose or topic. Some colleges and universities wi ll look at your experience – say, if you worked in business for many years – and  give you a certain number of credits for that experience so you don’t have to ta ke classes about things that you already know about.  

Now, most colleges and universities don’t do very m uch of this, but there are some that will give you credit for relevant life ex perience if it is connected to the content of a certain class. Torrie says, “I won’t n eed to take very many courses” (or classes) “to graduate,” to finish. Carlos says,  “That sounds pretty fishy (fishy) to me.” Something that is “fishy” is something that  is suspicious, something that doesn’t seem right, something that may be dishonest , even.  

Torrie says, however, “Don’t worry. My transcript a nd degree will be indistinguishable from those from a traditional uni versity, without nearly as much work.” Your “transcript” (transcript) is an officia l list of the classes or courses that you took and the grades that you received in a coll ege or university – or any school, really. “To be indistinguishable,” (indisti nguishable) means to be unable to tell the difference between two different things . “To be indistinguishable” means that you can’t tell the difference. You can’t  say this one is from here and this one is from there.  

What Torrie is saying here is that her transcript a nd degree will be the same, or will look the same, as any traditional university’s  transcript and degree, but she  

won’t have to do very much work. Carlos then says, “That should tell you something.” That expression, “that should tell you something,” means you should realize that there’s a problem here. You should rea lize that there’s something wrong. 

He then asks, “How is their job placement rate?” “J ob placement” refers to getting a job once you finish your degree. So, Carl os is asking how good is this college at getting its graduates, the people who fi nish studying there, a job when they’re done – when they’re done with their educati on. Torrie says, “I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be as competitive as any o ther college graduate.” “To be competitive” (competitive) here means to have the s ame qualifications as someone from a different college.  

The word “competitive” can also refer to someone wh o likes to win, who likes to beat other people in games and contests. Here, howe ver, it really just means that you have the same talent or you have the same quali fications as someone else so that you will have as good a chance as another p erson of getting a job. A “graduate” (graduate) is a person who has finished his or her education and has, we would say, “earned (earned) a degree.” You can b e a high school graduate. You can be a college graduate.  

Carlos says, “If you say so.” That expression, depe nding on how it’s said, usually indicates that the person doesn’t really believe yo u. “Well, if you say so” – that means I don’t think you’re right, but I’m not going  to argue with you. Carlos continues, “What are you doing right now?” Torrie s ays, “I’m playing a video game stealing cars. At Harford, that’s considered r elevant life experience. Cool, huh?”  

So, Torrie says that she’s playing a video game, an d at this online university she’s going to, they will give her credit for that life experience. She’ll get college credit for playing video games. Torrie says, “Cool,  huh?” She thinks it’s okay. She thinks it’s wonderful. Carlos says, “Yeah, cool ,” but he says it in such a way to mean, “Well, unfortunately that means that you r eally are going to a college that is a degree mill” – that this university isn’t  really legitimate.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
