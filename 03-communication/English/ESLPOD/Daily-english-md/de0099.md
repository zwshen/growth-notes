Between six and seven there are Hollywo od gossip shows like Access Hollywood and Entertainment Tonight, as well as som e sitcoms. One of my favorites is Seinfeld, the ultimate comedy program about nothing. Of course, there are some old favorites, too, such as MASH and  Friends. When I'm feeling really bored or really desperate‚ I'll turn on Whee l of Fortune and watch somebody buy a vowel.

We are talking about popular American television in  this podcast and I began the story by saying that, “When I want to kick back and  relax, I usually flip on the TV and see what’s on.” Couple of expressions there – “ to kick back,” two words – “to kick back” means, really, the same as relax, just s it down, not to do anything very difficult. “To flip on” (flip) (on) – “to flip on t he TV” means simply to turn it on, two separate words “flip on,” and “to see what’s on” me ans simply to see what programs are currently showing on television. Someo ne might ask, “What’s on TV tonight?” – meaning what programs are showing to night.

I said that, “Primetime begins at 8:00 PM on the co asts in the United States.” “Primetime” (primetime) is the time when the new sh ows, the most current programs, comedies, and dramas, are on. “Primetime”  in the United States is usually three hours long every night and that’s whe re the most important or most popular television programs are shown. “On the coas ts,” that is, on the west coast of the United States, Los Angeles, San Franci sco, San Diego etc., and on the “East coast” of the United States, New York, Wa shington, Boston, Atlanta, the primetime or most important shows are on betwee n 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM. In the middle of the United States, in the central part of the United States, primetime is usually on at 7:00 PM – from 7:00 PM t o 10:00 PM, but here in Los Angeles, it begins at 8 o’clock. And I said that ev en before that, there are plenty of “reruns and shows in syndication.” A “rerun,” al l one word, (rerun) is a program – a television program that has been on before but now it’s being shown again. Sometimes it could be three, four, or even five yea rs old but they’re still showing those same programs. “To rerun” means, of course, t o run it again or to show it again. When we say a show is in “syndication,” we m ean that this is a program -- a television program that individual television sta tions across the country have bought, have purchased in order to show on their st ation. The opposite of “syndication” or “syndicated programs” would be “ne twork programs,” and “network” (network) – “network programs” are one of  the programs that come from the five major companies – five major networks  in the United States.

I said I liked to watch “quiz shows.” A “quiz (quiz ) show” is a show where they ask questions about some general knowledge topic, h istory or politics, and people try to answer the fastest and the get points  or money if they answer the questions correctly. Two of the most popular that h ave been around for many years – one is called “Jeopardy.” “Jeopardy” has be en around for 20, 25 years, perhaps more, and it’s a daily program, 30 minutes,  where host of the program – Alex Trebek is his name – he asks questions for – t here are three different people. Now, the interesting thing about jeopardy i s that he doesn’t actually ask a question, he gives an answer and then you, as the p erson playing the game, have to ask a question so, for example the answer h e will show you is “Sacramento” and the question would be, “What is the capital of California?”

“Who Wants to be a Millionaire” is more traditional  – a traditional game show where one person asks a question and there’s only o ne person that -- who is playing the game. They’re not competing against or playing against anyone else and each question gets more and more difficult unti l the most difficult questions, if they get them right – all the other ones right, is worth a million dollars. Very few people a million dollars on “Who wants to be a Mill ionaire.”

I mentioned that I “tried out” to be on Jeopardy. “ To try out,” two words (try out) – “to try out” means that I wanted to be on the progr am and so I went and I took a test to see if I could be on the program. “To try o ut” as a verb, in general, means whenever you want to be part of – usually a team, s ometimes it may be a play, for example, and I’m trying out for the part of Ham let, Shakespeare’s Hamlet – means I go to the theater and I do some acting and see if they’ll select me to be the person who plays Hamlet. Well, you can try out for a sports team, you can try out for a play. I tried out for the game show, the quiz show, “Jeopardy,” thinking I could be “the next Ken Jennings.” “Ken Jennings” is  a person who won, I think, 2.5 million dollars on the game show “Jeopardy.” He  was on for weeks and weeks.

Well, I didn’t pass the test and I said, “So much f or trivia.” The expression, “So much for,” means that we’ve given up on it, we’ve n o longer have any hope for it. You may hear someone say, “Well, I went to the stor e and they didn’t have what I wanted. So much for that,” meaning I’ve given up. I  don’t want to do that again. “So much for trivia.” “Trivia” (trivia) – “trivia” is small facts, little facts, not very important, knowing the capitals of all the 50 state s in the United States would be “trivia.” I said that the national news comes on at  6:30 here in Los Angeles and each of the major networks – well, at least three o f the five major networks have a national news show that is 30 minutes long every night. There’s also, of course, local news programs, “local news” here in Los Angel es and in most cities in the United States.

Between 6 and 7 at night here in Los Angeles, there  are Hollywood gossip shows on. “To gossip” (gossip) means to talk about other people, usually something about their private life, and Hollywood gossip show s, of course, would talk about famous stars, famous movie stars, and television st ars. The two shows that are most popular that have been around for many years o n American television are “Access Hollywood” and “Entertainment Tonight.” The re are also some “sitcoms” on during the 7 to 8 o’clock hour. A “sitcom” (sitc om) stands for “situation comedy” and it’s a comedy show that has some sort o f story. Usually we’re following a group of people, for example, the famou s sitcom from the 1990’s was “Friends” and “Friends” was about 6 young people li ving in New York City and that was a comedy show. That was a sitcom. One of t he most famous sitcoms from the 1990’s that is very popular still in the U nited States is called “Seinfeld,” and Seinfeld was the name of the star of the show a nd it was a show about four people – single people living also in New York – Ne w York City, and the famous joke on the show was that it was “a show about noth ing,” meaning there wasn’t any strong theme of the show. It was just about the  lives of these four people, and it was a very popular, very funny comedy show.

The other comedy shows that are popular or have bee n popular include “Friends,” which is also in other countries, in oth er languages. It’s been translated. You might have seen “Friends” in your o wn country. And the one that was very popular in the 1980’s is called “MASH” (ma sh). “MASH” was a show about doctors during the Korean War. It’s kind of a  strange situation to have a comedy about but it was a very, very popular show i n the 1970’s and 80’s, but people still watch the show in “reruns,” meaning ma ny television stations still show these programs like “Seinfeld,” “Friends,” and  “MASH” even though they are no longer making new shows or new episodes. I s aid when I feel really bored or really “desperate” – “to be desperate” means tha t you’ve done everything else you can do and you have no other choices, no other options. When you’re desperate – when I’m desperate I turn on “Wheel of Fortune.” “Wheel of Fortune” is another quiz show. It’s a game show where they s pin a big wheel and the wheel has different amounts of money on it and the game is to guess a bunch of words, usually an expression or a phrase, but they only give you one letter at a time and you have to guess what the word is. I don’ t really like it very much but it has been popular for 15, 20 years in the United Sta tes. One of the things they do on the show is you can guess any sort of consonant but if you want a vowel, you have to take some of the money you have won and “bu y a vowel.” So, I say at the end of the story, “I watch somebody buy a vowel ” because that’s something that’s always happening on the show. Someone will b uy an “A,” an “E,” an “I,” an “O,” or a “U” so they can help them guess what the word is. I’m very bad at that sort of game which is probably why I don’t like it.

Now let’s listen to the story this time at native r ate of speech.

When I want to kick back and relax, I usually flip on the TV and see what's on. Primetime begins at 8:00 PM on the coasts in the Un ited States, but there are plenty of reruns and shows in syndication between t he time I get home from work at five and eight o’clock. I like to watch quiz sho ws like Jeopardy or Who Wants to be a Millionaire? I actually tried out once to b e on Jeopardy, thinking I could be the next Ken Jennings! But I didn't pass the test. So much for trivia.
