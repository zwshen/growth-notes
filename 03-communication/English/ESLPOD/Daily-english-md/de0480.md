# Riding in a Carpool

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 80: Riding in a Carpool. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 480.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Riding in a Carpool.”  A “carpoo l” is when several people ride together in one car to go, usually, to work.  Le t’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Roberto:  Hey, Loreto.  Got a minute? 

Loreto:  I’m going to a meeting off-site, but we can talk if you don’t mind walking me to my car. 

Roberto:  Sure, okay.  I just wanted to ask if you’re i nterested in carpooling to work.  We only live a few blocks from each other.   

Loreto:  Thanks for asking, but I’m not sure carpooling w ould work for me. Sometimes I run late in the morning and I wouldn’t w ant to hold you up. 

Roberto:  We wouldn’t have to commute together every d ay, only on those days that are convenient for both of us.  Carpooling has its advantages, too.  In addition to doing our part for the environment, we co uld use the high-occupancy carpool lanes.  That’ll save time, especially if there’s a lot of traffic congestion.   

Loreto:  Yeah, I guess that could cut down on our commu te time.   

Roberto:  We also get preferential treatment for par king on the days we carpool. 

Loreto:  How would it work?  Do we set up a schedule a nd take turns driving? 

Roberto:  Why don’t I swing by and pick you up tomorrow morning and we can talk more about it? 

 Loreto:  If you don’t mind picking me up en route, tha t would be great.  By the way, how do you know where I live? 

Roberto:  Oh, I asked around.  See you tomorrow.

Our episode begins with Roberto asking Loreto, “Hey, Lo reto.  Got a minute?” The word “hey,” nowadays, is sometimes used informally to say “hi” or “hello.” It’s a very informal use, however.  Roberto asks if Loreto  has got a minute, meaning do you have a short time to talk to me.  When so meone says, “Got a minute?” they mean I want to talk to you for a short am ount of time, is this a good time. 

Loreto says, “I’m going to a meeting off-site, but we can talk if you don’t mind walking me to my car.”  “Off-site” means at a different location, not at your office in this case.  Loreto asks Roberto to walk her to her car.  “To walk (someone) to (somewhere)” means to accompany someone while they are wa lking; to walk alongside, we could say, that person – to walk with tha t person. 

Roberto says, “Sure, okay.  I just wanted to ask you if you ’re interested in carpooling to work.”  “To carpool” means to share a car w ith two or more people who are going to the same place.  Usually carpooling rel ates to going to work, though you could carpool to a concert for example.  Norma lly, however, it refers to two or more people riding in the same car.  In man y cities in the United States there are what are called “carpool lanes” on the free ways or the highways. These are parts of the road that only two or more peop le riding in the same car may use.  It’s a way of encouraging people to not use as m uch energy, to cut down traffic – to reduce traffic by giving people a specia l lane on the freeway where they can drive if you have two or sometimes three o r more people.  These are very popular here in Los Angeles 

Roberto says that he and Loreto only live a few blocks fro m each other, meaning they live very close to each other so it would makes sense for  them to drive to work together.  Loreto says, “Thanks for asking, but I’m no t sure carpooling would work for me.  Sometimes I run late in the morni ng and I wouldn’t want to hold you up.”  “To run late” means to be behind your sch edule, not to be on time, to do something later than you should.  Someone says, “I’ m running late,” they mean I have to go now, I am late for an appointment or I am behind my schedule. “Run” has many different meanings in English, as you prob ably know.  Take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.   

 “To hold (someone) up,” as in when Loreto says, “I don’t  want to hold you up,” means to delay someone, to do something so that the oth er person cannot get something done on time or as soon as he or she would l ike, to prevent someone from doing something on time or quickly.  “To hold (some one) up,” then, means to delay them.  Loreto was saying to Roberto sometimes I’ m late in the morning and I don’t want you to be late, too – I don’t want to hold you up. 

Roberto says, “We wouldn’t have to commute together ever y day, only on those days that are convenient for both of us.”  “To commute”  means to go from your home to your office and then back again.  So, if Rober to and Loreto are going to carpool, they would be commuting from their homes to th eir office – assuming they work at the same office, which is normally the case.  I carpooled – and notice we use it as a verb, as well – when I was commuting  back in St. Paul, back in Minnesota when I live there many years ago.  When I was teaching high school, I would with carpool with one of the other lan guage teachers.  She was a German teacher, I believe.  That was commuting by using a carpool.  We only did that a couple of days a week, on the other days we d rove separately. 

Roberto says, “Carpooling has its advantages, too.  In addition to doing our part for the environment, we could use the high-occupancy carp ool lanes.”  “To do your part” means to help something happen, to contribut e to something.  “We want everyone to do their part,” we want everyone to do  their share; we want everyone to do what they should do to help the larger group effort.  A “high- occupancy carpool lane” is what I was talking about earlier  when I mentioned carpool lanes; sometimes they’re called “high-occupancy.”  “O ccupancy” refers to how many people are there in a particular place or how  many people could fit in a particular place.  “High-occupancy” would be that you ha ve many people, in this case in your car.  The minimum is usually two people; somet imes the minimum to use these special carpool lanes is three people.  In some  states they’re called “HOV lanes,” where the “V” stands for vehicle, in this case  a car or a truck.  So, high-occupancy vehicle lanes or high-occupancy carpool lanes are  the same thing. 

Roberto says, “That will save time (meaning using the car pool lanes will save time), especially if there’s a lot of traffic congestion. ”  The idea here is that carpool lanes have fewer cars in them become most people d rive themselves to work alone, so you can go faster in the carpool lane usua lly, especially if there is a lot of traffic congestion.  “Traffic congestion” is when  you have too many cars on the freeway or the highway, and it causes all of the  cars to move very slowly. 

Loreto says, “Yeah, I guess that could cut down on our co mmute time.”  “To cut down on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to use l ess of something or to  

 reduce something.  Loreto is saying that yes, they could get  to work faster if they used the carpool lanes.  Roberto says, “We also get prefe rential treatment for parking on the days we carpool.”  “Preferential treatme nt” is treating some people differently, being nicer to someone, or giving someon e special benefits that you don’t give other people.  In some companies, to encourag e employees to carpool, they will give good parking spots for their cars if you carpool.   

Loreto then asks, “How would it work?  Do we set up a sch edule and take turns driving?”  “To take turns” means to do one thing after  another: I do something and then you do something.  Or if there are three of us, first I do something, then you do something, then the third person does something, and then I do something again, and so on, and so forth.  That is “taki ng turns,” each person gets a chance to do something after the other person. 

Roberto says, “Why don’t I swing by and pick you up tomorro w morning and we can talk more about it?”  “To swing by,” when we’re ta lking about driving, means to go to a place for short period of time, especially so meone’s office or home to visit with that person.  In this case, Roberto is going t o swing by – going to drive to her house and pick her up; that is, take her with him  in his car.  Loreto says, “If you don’t mind picking me up en route, that would be g reat.”   “En route,” which is some times pronounced “en route” although the preferre d pronunciation is “en route” or  “en route,” is a French expression.  In Engli sh, we use it to mean “on the way,” on the path between where you are starting a nd where you end up.  So I go from my house, I stop and pick you up at your house,  and together we go to work – I pick you up en route to work. 

Loreto then says, “By the way, how do you know where I li ve?”  Roberto answers, “Oh, I asked around.”  “To ask around” means to get a piece of information by asking many different people until you fi nd someone who knows the answer.  “I asked around about someone who could reco mmend a good movie to me this weekend” – I asked many different peopl e until I found someone who knew, who could give me that piece of information.   Why Roberto was asking around about where Loreto lives is a little strang e.  It’s a little, ah, perhaps something that Loreto needs to be careful about, this Roberto – I don’t know, I don’t trust him! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
