This episode is called “Retiring From a Job.”  When you l eave your job when you get older – 55-60-65 – you stop working, you retire.  A nd this is going to be a dialogue between Meredith and Oscar that will include a lot of vocabulary we associate with retirement.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Meredith:  Are you going to Stanley’s retirement party?

Oscar:  Sure, I want a glimpse of the future.  I can’t wait to retire.

Meredith:  It’ll be a long time before you get the g olden handshake.  Me?  I may be ready for early retirement.

Oscar:  Are you seriously thinking about taking the early re tirement package the company is offering?

Meredith:  I’m thinking about it.  My health isn’t get ting any better, and I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in this office.

Oscar:  But can you afford it?

Meredith:  The early retirement package is pretty genero us, and I’ve saved up a nice little nest egg over the years.

Oscar:  Then what are you waiting for?  If I were in yo ur shoes, I wouldn’t hem and haw about it.  I’d make the decision to retire now  – today!

Meredith:  Why are you getting all worked up?  Are you after my job?

 Oscar:  No way!  I just can’t stand to see someone who can retire stay at this job. I’d trade places with you in a minute.

Meredith:  I doubt that – not if it meant being a ca rd-carrying member of AARP. You’re too young to be thinking about retirement.

Oscar:  I didn’t say I was ready for retirement.  I’m j ust thinking about it – all the time!

Our dialogue begins with Meredith asking Oscar, “Are yo u going to Stanley’s retirement party?”  A “retirement party” is, of course,  for someone who is “retiring,” meaning they are leaving their job.  They’ re no longer going to work anymore, not just at that job, but typically at any job when you retire as you get older.  Oscar says, “Sure, I want a glimpse of the future .”  A “glimpse” (glimpse) is a very quick look at something.  We might say a brief “g lance” (glance), which is another word for a very rapid or quick look.  Oscar wan ts a glimpse of the future, to know what his life will be like perhaps when  he retires.  He says, “I can’t wait to retire.”

Meredith says, “It’ll be a long time before you get the  golden handshake.”  A “handshake” is when two people put their hands together  and move them up and down.  “To shake someone’s hand” is what we would say as a  verb.  “Golden” refers, in this case, to a lot of money, and a “golden h andshake” is when a company pays one of its employees extra money to encourage them to retire. Because older employees are usually being paid a lot more , it is often cheaper for a company to encourage them to retire – to leave th eir job – than it is to have them continue working for them.  So, a golden handshake  is an “incentive,” something that is given to you to make you want to do some thing else.

Meredith says, “Me?  I may be ready for early retirement. ”  “Early retirement” is when you retire before the normal age; typically in the U.S. it’s 65 years old. Oscar says, “Are you seriously thinking about taking the earl y retirement package the company is offering?”  A “package” here means a coll ection of things, a set (set) of things.  A “retirement package” may include mone y; it may include other things that will get the person to retire early.  Agai n, early retirement is sometimes encouraged by companies in order to get older e mployees, more expensive employees, to leave the company early.

 Meredith is thinking about the early retirement package.   “Package,” I should say, also has other meanings in English, and those meanings are found in your Learning Guide.  Meredith says, “My health isn’t gettin g any better,” meaning I continue to get sicker and sicker, or at least I’m not ge tting more healthy.  “I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in this office.”  “The  rest of my days” would mean here the rest of my life.  Oscar asks, “But can you aff ord it?” meaning will you have enough money: “can you afford it?”  Meredith sa ys, “The early retirement package is pretty generous.”  It’s very genero us.  Someone who is “generous” (generous) is someone who is willing to share  things with you; it can also refer to more than expected amounts of money.  If everyone in the office donates 10 dollars to some charity and you decide to don ate 1,000 dollars, they would say, “Wow, that’s a very generous donation.”

Meredith says that the early retirement package is pretty  generous, “and,” she says, “I’ve saved up a nice little nest egg over the years.”  “To save up” is a two- word phrasal verb that means usually to save money for a p articular purpose or for a particular thing that you want to buy: “I’m saving  up my money to buy the iPad.”  Or, “I’m saving up my money to take a trip to F iji.”  That would be an example of to save up.  Well, you should also, I hope, sa ve up for your retirement.  At least if you live in the United State s and do not work for the government, you usually have to take care of yourself mostly, and that’s why you need to save up.  The “up” is just a word of emphasis, a s it is often in these two- word phrasal verbs.

Meredith says that she saved up a nice little nest egg.  A “nest egg” (two words) is money that you save for your retirement, money that y ou will use when you are no longer working.  Why do we say nest egg?  An “egg” co ntains a bird that is not yet born – not yet developed.  A “nest” is the place whe re the bird keeps his or her eggs – well, her eggs.  He doesn’t have eggs; only the female has eggs I think.  So a nest egg, then, refers to eggs that you wo uld have saved and guarded and protected, like a bird would protect her eggs.

Oscar says, “Then what are you waiting for?”  He’s asking Me redith why she doesn’t just retire now.  “If I were in your shoes, I wo uldn’t hem and haw about it.” When you say, “if I were in your shoes,” you mean if I we re you, if I had your position or your situation.  “If I were in your shoes, I  wouldn’t hem and haw.”  “To hem (hem) and haw (haw)” is a single verb; in this sente nce the two words are used together typically to mean to hesitate, to spend a lot of time deciding whether you want to you or not, to spend a lot of time  going, “Oh, maybe I should retire...well, maybe not.  I’m not sure.”  Someone w ho is not very decisive, who doesn’t make decisions quickly or easily could be said hemming  and hawing.

 Oscar says, “I’d make the decision to retire now – today!”  Meredith says, “Why are you getting all worked up?”  “To get worked up” is a phrasal verb meaning to become worried, to become anxious, to not be able to st op thinking about something, perhaps to become angry or upset.  Someone ma y say to you, “Don’t get all worked up about it,” meaning don’t get so anxi ous, so worried, so excited about this particular issue.

Meredith says, “Are you after my job?”  In this case, “afte r” means in pursuit of, wanting to get or to have something, trying to do somet hing.  Here in Los Angeles it’s very common to see older men – 50-60 years old  – marrying younger women, often 20 or 30 years old.  Some people say the woman is after his money.  Of course, it’s possible for a younger man to m arry an older woman and to be after her money; could be either way.  I’m not after anyone’s money.  I don’t think anyone is after my money, although my wife di d ask me about going skydiving, where you jump out of a plane down to the gro und.  Hmm, maybe I should be careful!

Oscar says, “No way (I’m not after your job)!”  By the way,  “after” has other meanings in English as well, and you know where to find those, in the Learning Guide.  Oscar says, “No way (not at all; I’m not after you r job)!  I just can’t stand to see someone who can retire stay at this job.  I’d tra de places with you in a minute.”  “To trade places with (someone)” means to excha nge your situation for another situation.  So you’re working in job A, I’m wo rking in job B; if we trade places, now I’m working in your job and you’re working in  my job.

Oscar says that he would trade places with Meredith “in a  minute,” meaning without even thinking about it, quickly.  Meredith says, “I  doubt that – not if it meant being a card-carrying member of AARP.”  “To be a card-carrying member” means to be an official member of an organization, usu ally an organization that you believe in very strongly.  Organizations typically issue sm all pieces of paper, called “cards,” that say that you are a member, that’s whe re this expression comes from.  AARP (sometimes pronounced like a word, “AA RP”) is the American Association of Retired Persons.  It’s an organiza tion for people over the age of 50, which tries to influence regulations a nd laws related to older people.  It’s a very powerful organization in the Unite d States, as our population gets older and older.  You may not have noticed, but e veryone seems to be getting older every year; I’m not sure what’s going on!

Oscar says, “I didn’t say I was ready for retirement.  I’m just thinking about it – all the time!” meaning always.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

We hope that our scriptwriter doesn’t take early retirem ent or accept any golden handshakes. That’s because we love Dr. Lucy Tse.
