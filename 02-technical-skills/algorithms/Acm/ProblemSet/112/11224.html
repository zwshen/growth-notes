<h1>F. Let's swim!</h1>

<h3>Time limit: 1s</h3>

<p>It is time to swim and you should help Gustavo to get a good place
in the World Swimming Championship. The competition has two phases. In
the first phase, the qualification phase, every competitor will swim
and the eight fastest swimmers will advance to second phase, the big
final. During the final, each competitor will swim again to decide who
is the best swimmer. In the beginning of the competition, every
swimmer has associated with him a rank indicating how good he is,
where the best competitor has a rank <math>1</math>, the second one
has rank <math>2</math> and so on.</p>

<p> Gustavo wants to reach the finals and to finish in the top three
to get a medal, but he does not want to spend all his energy in the
qualification round. Actually, he desires to swim as slow as possible
in the first phase in a way he can still advance to the final and get
a medal.
</p>


<p> When going to the final, it is important to get a good lane. There
are eight lanes in the pool and each one is assigned to a swimmer
according to how fast he swam in the previous phase. The fastest
swimmer gets lane #4 (the best lane), the second gets lane #5, the
third gets lane #3, the fourth gets lane #6, the fifth gets lane #2,
the sixth gets lane #7, the seventh gets lane #1 and the eighth one
gets lane #8 (the worst lane).  </p>

<p> During the final, Gustavo believes he can swim faster than a
competitor if he got a better lane than him or if he has a better rank
than him. Your task is to determine what is the worst possible place
Gustavo can get in the first phase in a way he can advance to the
final and get a medal. You should also determine in which position
Gustavo will end at the final.  </p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases, <math>T</math>
(<math>1 &le; T &le; 120</math>), after there will be a blank line and
then the first test case. Each test case starts with <math>8 &le; N
&le; 1000</math>, the number of competitors. The following line will
contain an integer <math>R</math>, representing Gustavo's rank.  Then
<math>N - 1</math> lines will follow, each line has an integer
<math>R</math>, representing the rank of that competitor, and a time
in the format <math>MM:SS:DD</math>, which is the time that competitor
got in the qualification phase. The first field represents the
minutes, <math>00 &le; MM &le; 09</math>, the second field represents
the seconds, <math>00 &le; SS &le; 59</math>, and the third field
represents hundredths of a second, <math>00 &le; DD &le; 99</math>.
If more than one competitor got the same time, the tie will be broken
according to their ranks, the competitors with best ranks will come
first. </p>

<p>You should consider <math>00:01:00</math> as the fastest time a
competitor can get, being Gustavo the only swimmer able to achieve a
faster time. Be aware that if two competitors are not tied with the
same time, there should exist a difference of at least one hundredth
of a second between their times. There is a blank line after each test
case.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>For each test case you must print two lines. The first contains the
the number of the test case (see below the exact format) and the second
contains the following message: <tt>Gustavo should be #N
during the qualification to achieve position #P in the final.</tt>.
