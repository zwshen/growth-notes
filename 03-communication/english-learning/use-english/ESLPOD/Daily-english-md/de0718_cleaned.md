This episode is a dialogue between Samantha and Jin ho; it is talking about being on a “jury,” a group of people in a courtroom who d ecide whether someone is innocent or guilty.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Samantha:  How was your first day on a jury? 

Jinho:  It was okay.  The judge swore us in and the n we listened to the beginning of the prosecutor’s case.  Two witnesses testified.  

Samantha:  That sounds exciting!  I’d love to be on  a jury.  Why didn’t they sequester you?  That’s what they do on TV. 

Jinho:  We didn’t need to be sequestered.  This isn ’t a high-profile case.  Hey, guess what?  I was selected as foreman. 

Samantha:  Wow, that’s a lot of responsibility.   

Jinho:  It’s no big deal.  I think I was selected b ecause nobody else wanted the job.   

Samantha:  What’ll happen tomorrow? 

Jinho:  We’ll hear the rest of the prosecutor’s cas e and then the defense attorney will put on her case.  I’m sure the entire thing wi ll be over in three or four days.   

Samantha:  Were there any interesting exhibits?  Wi ll the defendant take the stand?   

Jinho:  No, no interesting exhibits so far, and I’m  not sure if the defendant will take the stand. 

Samantha:  I wish I were in your place.  I’d love t o put a criminal behind bars.   

Jinho:  You’re supposed to be impartial when you’re  on a jury, remember? 

Samantha:  Oh sure, I’d only convict the guilty def endants – just like on TV!

Samantha begins by asking Jinho, “How was your firs t day on a jury?”  A “jury” (jury) is a group of people in a courtroom, in a le gal case, who decide whether someone is innocent or guilty – whether they did th e crime or did not do the crime.  Juries can also be used to decide whether o ne person has wronged another person and has to pay them money.  Juries c an be used for both criminal cases, cases involving someone breaking the law, as  well as civil cases, cases involving people who have damaged or done damage to  someone else, and that person is trying to get money back from them. 

Jinho says, “It was okay.  The judge swore us in an d then we listened to the beginning of the prosecutor’s case.”  The “judge” i s the man or woman who is sort of the boss of the courtroom.  When you go to a court, there’ll be one person who is in charge, who decides who talks or who can say what.  This person sometimes makes a decision about whether someone is  guilty or innocent in some courtrooms.  But for most cases, there is a gr oup of citizens, what we call the “jury,” typically 12 of them, who make the deci sion. 

So, the judge swore the jury in.  “Swore” is the pa st tense of the verb “swear.” “To swear in (someone)” or “to swear (someone) in” means to make them repeat a statement, a sentence or two, where they promise to do something.  For a jury, they promise to listen to the facts of the case and  make an honest determination – an honest decision about whether the person is gu ilty or not.  For someone who is a “witness,” someone who is going to be givi ng evidence in the case, that person is sworn in to tell the truth.  The traditio nal phrase is “To tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,” that is, o nly the truth.   

So, the judge swore in the jury, “and then we liste ned to the beginning of the prosecutors case,” Jinho says.  I should mention th at “swear” has a couple of other meanings in English as well, some important m eanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for those.  The “prosecutor” is the lawyer – the attorney – who works for the government, and his or her job is to show that this person is guilty.   

The person works for and defends person who is bein g accused of a crime – that is, the person that they are trying to put in jail,  that attorney is called the “defense” attorney.  So you have a defense attorney  and a prosecuting attorney in a criminal case.  In a civil case, you have a “p laintiff,” someone who’s making a complaint, and a “defendant,” someone who is defend ing themselves against this complaint.  Well, in this case we have a criminal c ase, so there’s a prosecutor from the government.  After they were sworn in, Jin ho says that two witnesses testified.  A “witness” is a person who has some kn owledge about the event, or in this case the crime.  “To testify” means to formall y make a statement, to go in front of the judge and the jury and to say what you  think happened or what you know about a certain case. 

Samantha says, “That sounds exciting!  I’d love to be on a jury.  Why didn’t they sequester you?  That’s what they do on TV.”  “To se quester” (sequester) means to isolate.  Sometimes when there’s a very importan t case the judge doesn’t want the jury to become influenced by the newspapers and  other people talking about the case, so they will sequester the jury.  They’ll  put them in a hotel, take away their televisions, not allow them to read the newsp aper until trial is over.  This is not a common procedure; it’s not done very often.  It’s only done for very famous cases; cases, that is, that are getting a lot of pu blicity, a lot of newspaper coverage.  Here in Los Angeles, the O.J. Simpson mu rder trial 20 years ago was a case where they had a sequestered jury.  Samantha  says, “That’s what they do on TV,” meaning well, that’s what television shows show happening.  But of course, that’s not reality. 

Jinho says, “We didn’t need to be sequestered.  Thi s isn’t a high-profile case.” Something that is “high-profile” is something that is receiving a lot of attention because it is important or involves someone famous.   Celebrities – famous people here in Los Angeles are always getting into trouble with drugs or alcohol, and sometimes they get caught by the police and the y have to go to court.  That would be an example of a high-profile case, somethi ng that everyone is paying attention to.   

Jinho says, “Hey, guess what?  I was selected as fo reman.”  The “foreman” (foreman) is the leader of the jury.  He or she is the person who is in charge of the jury, helping the jury make a decision.  They s till just have one vote, but the jury selects a leader so that you can have one pers on leading the discussion during the time when they discuss whether the perso n is guilty or innocent after the end of all the testimony – of all the evidence.   That period is called “deliberations,” when they sit around in a group by  themselves to decide whether the person was guilty or not. 

Samantha says, “Wow, that’s a lot of responsibility .”  Jinho says, “It’s no big deal,” meaning it wasn’t that important.  “I think I was selected because nobody else wanted the job,” that is, no one else wanted t o be the foreman.  Samantha says, “What happens tomorrow?”  Jinho says, “We’ll hear the rest of the prosecutor’s case and then the defense attorney wil l put on her case.” Remember, the defense attorney is the person defend ing the person who is being accused of the crime.  Jinho says, “I’m sure the entire thing will be over in three or four days.”   

Samantha says, “Were there any interesting exhibits ?”  “Exhibits” in a courtroom case are objects or documents related to the case t hat are brought in and shown to the jury and discussed by the attorneys.  “Exhib it” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for some more of those. Samantha asks if there were any interesting exhibit s; she then asks, “Will the defendant take the stand?”  The “defendant” is the person who is being defended by the defense attorney, the person being accused o f the crime that the government wants to put in jail.  “To take the stan d” means to stand up – actually to go into a chair and sit and give an official sta tement about what happened. You can take the stand as a witness, you know somet hing and so you go and you tell what you know.  Or, you could take the sta nd as the defendant, the person who is being accused of the crime.   

Jinho says, “No, no interesting exhibits so far, an d I’m not sure if the defendant will take the stand.”  Samantha says, “I wish I wer e in your place.  I’d love to put a criminal behind bars.”  “To put a criminal behind  bars” means to punish someone who has broken the law by putting them in j ail.  Of course, that’s what a jury does; if they decide the person is guilty they  are putting him or her behind bars, that is, in a prison – in a jail.  Jinho says , “You’re supposed to be impartial when you’re on a jury, remember?”  “To be impartial ” (impartial) means to be able to listen to what other people say and make a fair decision, not one based on your own ideas, not biased.  We might also say t o make an “objective” decision.  Samantha says, “Oh sure, I’d only convic t the guilty defendants – just like on TV!”  “To convict” means to find someone gu ilty in a courtroom trial.  “To be guilty,” as you probably know, is the opposite o f “innocent,” meaning you’ve done something wrong, you’ve broken the law.  On th e television shows we watch, of course, only the bad people – the guilty people are convicted, are put behind bars.  In the real world, it’s not quite tha t easy! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
