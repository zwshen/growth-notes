This episode is a dialogue between Ella and Jimmy.  It’s related to Halloween and uses a lot of vocabulary related to scary thing s.  Let’s get started.  Wah-ha- ha-ha ha-ha!  [evil laugh] 

[start of dialogue] 

Ella:  No matter what you say, I am not going out t onight.  It’s Halloween and evil things are lurking everywhere. 

Jimmy:  Come on, it’s Halloween!  It’s the holiday when kids get dressed up and ask for candy.  There is nothing evil or creepy abo ut this day.  If you’re scared stiff, it’s your own doing. 

Ella:  Don’t kid yourself.  This is the day when gh osts, witches, zombies, and vampires come out and have a field day.  I’ve got g oosebumps just thinking about it. 

Jimmy:  Do you mean you actually believe in all of that stuff?  You are too old to be so gullible.  I’m going out. 

Ella:  Look!  Hurry up and close that door!  There’ s a black cat.  Oh my God.  If you walk out that door, the next time I see you, it  might be in a graveyard.   

Jimmy:  You’re crazy and I’m leaving. 

Ella:  If you have to go, take these with you. 

Jimmy:  What are they? 

Ella:  It’s a cross and some garlic.  You’ll thank me later. 

Jimmy:  Ugh! 

[end of dialogue] 

Ella begins by saying, “No matter what you say, I’m  not going out tonight.”  It doesn’t matter what you tell me, she’s saying, I’m not going to leave the house; I’m not going to go out somewhere tonight.  “It’s H alloween and evil things are lurking everywhere.”  “Halloween,” you may know, is  celebrated on October 31 st . It is the eve of All Hallows’ Day or, we would say in the United States, All Saints’ Day, and traditionally it’s been associated with sp irits, ghosts, scary things, and people here in the U.S., especially children, dress  up on this holiday and go around asking for candy.  We’ve talked about Hallow een on other episodes.  Go back and listen to episode number 73. 

Ella says that there are evil things lurking everyw here.  “Evil” is bad, wrong, something that is very wrong, very, perhaps, immora l.  “To lurk” (lurk) means to be somewhere, but to be hidden away, perhaps waitin g to appear.  We have an expression, “he was lurking in the shadows.”  He wa s waiting there, perhaps for someone to come by.  It sounds like a dangerous thi ng, although it might not be. So “lurking” is waiting around, but hidden so no on e can see you. 

Jimmy says, “Come on, it’s Halloween!  It’s the hol iday when kids get dressed up and ask for candy.”  “Come on” means change your mi nd Ella, don’t be so silly, don’t be that way.  This holiday – and by the way, it’s not technically a holiday in the United States.  You still have to work on Hallo ween.  “It’s the holiday when kids get dressed up.”  “To dress up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to put on different kind of clothing than you normally wou ld.  It could be clothing that’s very formal if you’re going to a wedding or a job i nterview.  Or it could be a “costume,” something that makes you look like a dif ferent kind of person, and that’s the kind of dressing up that Jimmy is talkin g about here.  On Halloween kids put on different costumes so they look like Sp iderman, and…and, I don’t know, Harry Potter.  I haven’t been paying attentio n recently.   

So, Jimmy says, “There is nothing evil or creepy ab out this day.”  “Creepy” (creepy) means scary, but also uncomfortable, somet hing that makes you a little fearful or not very comfortable; “uneasy,” we might  say.  Jimmy says, “If you’re scared stiff, it’s your own doing.”  “To be scared stiff” (stiff) means to be very frightened, to be very scared.  You can’t do anythi ng because you are so afraid of what is going to happen or what is happening.  J immy says if that’s how  

scared you are, “it’s your own doing,” meaning it’s  your own fault.  It’s because of something you do, not what someone else is doing. 

Ella says, “Don’t kid yourself.”  “To kid (kid) you rself” means to make yourself believe something that isn’t true.  “To kid,” as a verb, normally means to joke with, to say something that isn’t really true just to be funny.  But the expression “to kid yourself” means, in a way, to play a joke o n yourself, to make yourself believe something that isn’t true.  She says, “This  is the day when ghosts, witches, zombies, and vampires come out and have a field day.”  A “ghost” traditionally has been defined as the spirit of a d ead person.  If you ever read the famous play Macbeth  by Shakespeare, you know that there is the ghost o f Banquo.  When I was growing up there was a famous c artoon ghost, Casper. Casper the Ghost, whatever happened to him?  I thin k he died!  A “witch” is someone, usually a woman, who has magical powers an d uses them to do bad things.  If you saw the movie The Wizard of Oz , there were different witches in the movie; there were good witches and there were b ad witches, however, in The Wizard of Oz .  But normally a witch is someone we think of, aga in usually a woman, who has magic powers to do evil things.   

A “zombie” is the body of a person who has died but  still walks around the Earth, even though he or she cannot speak.  So it’s a litt le different than a ghost; a ghost is just the spirit that can appear and disapp ear, that can travel through walls, and so forth.  A zombie is a actual body – a  dead body that walks around as if it were alive.  Of course, all of these thing s are imaginary, but that’s what they are when you read about them in fiction.   

“Vampires” are people who are immortal; that is, th ey never die.  They traditionally have long, sharp teeth.  They walk in  the night, they can’t sleep, they bite people’s necks, and drink their blood.  Sounds  like an old girlfriend I had! The most famous vampire is probably Dracula, in Eng lish literature.  The second would probably be those guys from Twilight .  I don’t know.  There was a famous movie Interview with a Vampire , with I think it was Tom Cruise – who some people believe is actually a vampire!  I don’t know  if that’s true or not. 

So, we have ghosts, witches, zombies, and vampires that come out, that can be seen, and they have a field day.  The expression “t o have a field (field) day” means to have fun, to do whatever you want, as much  as you want to do it.  Ella says, “I’ve got goosebumps just thinking about it.”   “Goosebumps” are little, small bumps or raised areas on your skin that are caused by either cold temperatures; that is, when it’s cold suddenly you may feel these  little bumps on your skin. Some people say they can also be caused by fear.  S o the idea that something gives you goosebumps means that it makes you very a fraid, very scared.    

 There’s actually a famous children’s book series, v ery popular with young boys, at least it was a few years ago in the United State s called Goosebumps .  And, these are scary stories that were popular among fif th and sixth and seventh graders.  Some of them are actually kind of interes ting.  They’re easy English, and if you enjoy reading scary stories, and your En glish is still not ready for adult stories, well, Goosebumps  is not a bad option – not a bad choice. 

Jimmy says, “Do you mean you actually believe in al l of that stuff (all of those things)?  You are too old to be so gullible.”  “To be gullible” (gullible) means to be easily tricked or deceived, to believe everything t hat you are told.  Jimmy says, “I’m going out (I’m going to leave the house).”   

Ella says, “Look!  Hurry up and close that door!  T here’s a black cat.  Oh my God. If you walk out that door, the next time I see you,  it might be in a graveyard.” Okay, so traditionally if you see a black cat you h ave bad luck, and that’s what Ella sees when Jimmy opens the door.  She says, “If  you walk out that door, the next time I see you, it might be in a graveyard.”  A “grave” (grave) is where you put a body after it dies.  A “graveyard,” is also c alled a “cemetery,” it’s a large area where you have a lot of graves.  What Ella is saying is that if Jimmy leaves he might be killed.     

Jimmy says, “You’re crazy and I’m leaving.”  Ella s ays, “If you have to go, take these with you.”  Jimmy says, “What are they?”  She  says, “It’s a cross and some garlic.  You’ll thank me later.”  A “cross” is two pieces of wood or some material that form like a “t”; is the symbol of the Christia n religion, where Jesus Christ was said to have died on a cross.  That’s why the cross  is a symbol of Christianity. Traditionally the idea was that if you had a cross,  you could hold it up and it would prevent evil beings from coming close to you or coming near you because they were afraid.  It was essentially a symbol of G od.  “Garlic” traditionally in literature was thought to have protected you agains t vampires – people like Tom Cruise!  So, Ella is offering Jimmy a cross and som e garlic so he can protect himself against these evil beings that she believes .  Jimmy says, “Ugh!”  He’s frustrated, he doesn’t believe what Ella is telling  him. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
