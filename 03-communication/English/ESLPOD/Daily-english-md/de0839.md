Our happy dialog begins with Nicole saying to Tom, “I’m really sorry to hear about you and Catherine getting a divorce.” “I’m so rry to hear about” is an expression that we use when we hear some bad news, and we are telling the other person that we understand, and we feel sorry for them. Nicole says she’s sorry to hear about Tom and Catherine getting a div orce. A “divorce” (divorce) is an official or legal end to a marriage between two people. Tom says, “I appreciate it” – I appreciate you telling me that y ou feel sorry – “but it was a long time coming.” The expression “a long time coming” m eans that it had been expected for a long time. It was not a surprise. We  knew it was going to happen.

Tom says, “We’ve been heading” – Catherine, maybe w e should call her “Katie”? – Catherine and Tom “have been heading toward divor ce for years.” “To be heading toward” means you are moving in that direct ion. He says, “I just hope it doesn’t get too messy.” “Messy” (messy) here means difficult, complicated, not nice, not kind. “Messy” can also be when something is dirty or disorganized. You could have a “messy” desk. I could have a messy des k. (Actually, I have  a messy desk!)

Nicole says, “I don’t mean to pry, but didn’t the t wo of you have a prenup?” “To pry” (pry) means to try to find out the details of someone else’s life, to try to find out the secret things that are going on with someon e else, things they may not want to tell you about – personal things, private t hings. Nicole says, “I don’t mean to pry” – my intention is not to pry – “but didn’t the two of you have a prenup?” A “prenup” (prenup) is short for a “prenuptial (prenu ptial) agreement.” That’s a legal agreement that is made between a husband and a wife  before they get married that decides usually how they are going to have the ir money divided in case they get divorced. So, a “prenuptial agreement” – “nupti al” refers to marriage – is an agreement that is used often by people who have a l ot of money and who are afraid of losing their money if they get divorced. Tom says, “Yeah,” – yes – “we have a prenup, but Catherine wants it set aside bec ause our financial situation has changed so much since we got married.” “To set aside” (aside) means to decide not to use something or to decide not to con sider something. Sometimes it can mean simply to save something for later. But  when we talk about a legal agreement, it means to not consider it, to act as t hough it didn’t exist, to ignore it.

Tom says, “She also wants sole custody of Sarah, al imony, and child support.” “Sole” (sole) means just one or just one person. “C ustody” (custody) is the legal right to take care of a child. “To have sole custod y” would mean that only one of the parents, either the father or the mother – usua lly the mother – has the legal right to take care of the child, to have the child to live with them. When a man and a woman get divorced, often when there are chil dren, there are

disagreements about who should take care of the chi ldren. There are disagreements about custody.

Catherine wants sole custody of their daughter, ali mony, and child support. “Alimony” (alimony) is money that one spouse, eithe r the husband or the wife, gives to the other spouse because the other person doesn’t have enough money to live on. Traditionally, it has been money the ma n would give to the woman – the husband would give to the wife so that she coul d take care of herself, have a place for the child or the children to live, and so  forth. Nowadays, it’s not necessarily the case that when you get a divorce, t he man will give the woman alimony. It could be the woman giving the man alimo ny.

“Child support” is when you are legally required to  give money to the other parent in order to help pay for the expenses of the child,  to feed the child, to send him to school and so forth. Nicole says, “We live in a com munity property state so that should simplify things, shouldn’t it?” A “community  property state” is a state where the law is when a man and a woman get married  – when two people get married – your property is divided 50-50 if you get  divorced, at least the property that you had received or had acquired – had gotten while you were married. All of the money, all of the property, the houses, the car s – all of that is divided 50-50. The husband gets 50%, the wife gets 50% - that’s a community property state. California is a community property state.

Tom says, “You’d think so” – you would think it wou ld simplify or make things easier – “but the distribution of property may get complicated.” “Property” refers to money and things that you own. “Distribution” re fers to who gets what. I get the car, you get the house, I get the jewelry, you get the lawn mower and so forth – that’s distribution of property. Tom says, “I’m hop ing we can settle everything amicably.” “To settle” here means to take care of. “Amicably” (amicably) means in a friendly, nice, pleasant way. Tom says, “But I ’m ready for a fight if it turns ugly.” “To turn ugly” means to become very difficul t, to become very unpleasant – perhaps even dangerous.

Tom says, “I’ve hired Dewey Cheatum.” “I’ve hired” means I have employed, I have give a job to Dewey Cheatum, who we find out, is a lawyer, an attorney. (He works for the law firm, the law company, of Dew ey, Cheatum, and Howe.) Nicole says, “Wow, you’re serious. He’s the most hi gh-powered divorce attorney in this city.” “High-powered” means very influentia l, very powerful. An “attorney,” is of course, a lawyer, someone who helps you with legal matters – contracts, crimes and so forth. “Divorce,” we’ve already talke d about, is when you legally separate and end a marriage. So, a high-powered div orce attorney would be a lawyer who is very powerful, very influential who d eals with divorces.

 Tom says, “I’m not taking any chances.” “To take a chance” would be to risk. Tom says, “I’m not taking any chances with my asset s or my daughter.” Your “assets” (assets) are things that are worth money –  a house, a piece of land, jewelry, investments and so forth. Tom says, “If Ca therine wants to play hardball, I’m coming out swinging.” The expression “to play h ardball” (hardball) means to do everything necessary to get what you want, espec ially when you are arguing or fighting with another person. You don’t care if the other person gets hurt. You’re going to be very tough. You’re going to be w hat we might call “ruthless” (ruthless). Tom says, if Catherine plays hard ball,  he’s “coming out swinging.” The expression “to come out swinging” (swinging) me ans to be ready to fight, to defend yourself, to argue for what you believe in, in a very strong and forceful way.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
