This episode is a dialogue between Cassandra and La zlo.  It’s going to be talking about following your dream – your goal for the futu re.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cassandra:  I’ve had it!  I’m quitting and I’m not coming back.  I was meant for greater things than working in this pathetic place.   Life is passing me by.

Lazlo:  You can’t quit.  You need the money and you  have responsibilities, remember?

Cassandra:  I’ve sacrificed enough for security.  I  want to make a difference.  I want to do big things.  I want to have an impact on  the world.

Lazlo:  That’s very admirable.  Most people want to  make a difference in the world, but don’t have the guts to try.

Cassandra:  You are so right!  But I’m going to mak e it happen.  I aspire to do great things and I won’t rest until I do.  I want to follow my dream.

Lazlo:  What is your dream?

Cassandra:  Um, well, I’m not quite sure what I’m d estined to do yet, but as soon as I figure out my true vocation, I’m following my heart.

Lazlo:  That’s great.  Until then, lunch break is o ver.  Could we get back to work?

Our dialogue begins with Cassandra saying, “I’ve ha d it!”  When you say, “I’ve had it” you mean I have had enough; it’s an express ion of frustration.  You don’t want to continue doing what you’re doing or experie ncing what you’re experiencing anymore.  Cassandra says, “I’m quittin g (I’m leaving my job) and I’m not coming back.  I was meant for greater thing s than working in this pathetic place.”  When you say that you are “meant for” some thing you mean you are intended for something, or you have specific expect ations for yourself about something.  I feel I was meant for podcasting; this  is what my life has been preparing me to do.  Well, probably not, but that’s  the idea.  “Pathetic” (pathetic) means it’s very uninteresting, it doesn’t deserve a ny respect.  Someone says, “Oh, that was a pathetic attempt to make me laugh” meaning it was a very weak, uninteresting, not a good attempt.  So this is a pa thetic place, Cassandra says, “Life is passing me by.”  “To pass (someone) by” me ans to go on without you, especially we say this when time is passing very qu ickly and you feel as though you are missing opportunities in life.  “Life is pa ssing me by,” I’m getting older but I’m not experiencing anything better.

Lazlo says, “You can’t quit.  You need the money an d you have responsibilities, remember?”  Cassandra says, “I’ve sacrificed enough  for security.”  “To sacrifice” as a verb means to give something up, to decide not  to do something because you think there is some greater good – there is som e greater benefit in the future. Sometimes you have to sacrifice your appetite for f ood in order to lose weight; you have to give something up.  Or, people make sac rifices; they sacrifice so that their children can have a better life.  The parents  work more hours or work harder so that their children can go to a better school.  That would be an example of a sacrifice.

Cassandra says that she has sacrificed enough for s ecurity.  “Security” here means a feeling of safety, of stability, that you h ave money and a house or a place to live.  She says, “I want to make a differe nce.”  “To make a difference” means to change the world in some positive way, to change what is happening around you in some positive way.  There was a song back in the 1980s you may remember called “We Are the World.”  I think it was  Michael Jackson who wrote the song; he was trying to make a difference in the  world.  You remember: “We are the world / We are the children / We are the on es who make a brighter day / So let’s start giving / So let’s start giving.”  Ne ver liked that song, really?

Anyway, Cassandra says that she wants to make a dif ference – hopefully not singing “We Are the World!”  She says, “I want to d o big things (I want to do something that is important).  I want to have an im pact on the world.”  “To have an impact” (impact) is to have an affect on the wor ld, to do something that changes some other activity or some other people.  Nowadays, people use the

word “impact” as a verb.  I don’t like this use; I don’t use it myself, but it’s become acceptable to say that I am going to impact somethi ng.  Personally, I hate that use of the word, but it is becoming common.

Cassandra wants to have an impact.  That’s okay, “i mpact” as a noun there, as it’s supposed to be.  Lazlo says, “That’s very admi rable.”  When you say something is “admirable” you mean that you respect it, you value it.  “Admirable” comes from the verb “to admire” (admire).  When you  admire something you respect it, you think it’s good; you may want to be  like it.  Lazlo says, “Most people want to make a difference in the world, but don’t have the guts to try.” The word “guts” (guts) here means courage, bravery,  willing to do something that is difficult or even dangerous.  There are other me anings of the word “gut.”  Take a look at our Learning Guide to find those.

Cassandra says, “You are so right!”  She’s saying to Lazlo that she agrees with him.  “But,” she says, “I’m going to make it happen .  I aspire to do great things and I won’t rest until I do (until I do great thing s).”  “To aspire” (aspire) means to try to do something that is difficult but important .  “He aspires to be in the Olympics.”  It’s not easy; it’s a very difficult go al, but he wants to do it – he aspires to do that.  Cassandra says she aspires to do great things and she won’t rest, meaning she’ll continue working until she doe s something great.  She says, “I want to follow my dream.”  This expression, “to follow your dream,” means to follow your goal, to do what you want to do.  To do  what you’ve always thought you should do, that’s to follow your dream.

Lazlo says, “What is your dream?”  Good question.  Cassandra says, “Um, well, I’m not quite sure (I’m not very sure) what I’m des tined to do yet.”  “To be destined (destined) to (something)” means to be int ended to be in the future or to have in the future.  It can simply mean the purpose  of something: “This man is destined to be a great leader.”  It’s almost as tho ugh that is the way that nature or God or fate has made this person.  They will eventu ally become great – they are destined to be great.  We have another word, “desti nation,” that’s the place where you are going.  You can see they are sort of related ideas.  Your goal, your object, your destination; they’re related to t his idea of being destined or intended for something.

Cassandra says she’s not sure what she’s destined to do yet, but as soon she figures out her true vocation, she will follow her heart.  A “vocation” (vocation) is what you believe that you should do – what career, what job you should do, but it’s a little more than just a job.  We have anothe r word, which is related to the meaning of “vocation,” which is “calling.”  “What is your calling?”  It often relates to some deeper, sometimes even spiritual purpose or  religious purpose.  We talk

about vocations to the priesthood – to the ministry  in the Christian churches. That’s the idea; it’s a deeper sense of what you sh ould be doing.

Cassandra says she doesn’t know what her true vocat ion is, but when she finds out – when she figures it out – she’s following her  heart.  “To follow your heart” means to do what you believe is right, to do what y ou think is good or correct.  It can also be used, as I think it is here, to mean the same as to follow your dream. Lazlo says, “That’s great.  Until then (until you f igure it out), lunch break is over.” “Lunch break” is the time in the middle of the day,  usually at noon – at 12 p.m. in most places in the U.S., where you stop and eat a m eal, your lunch.  Lazlo says, “lunch break is over.  Could we get back to work?”  So, Cassandra has all these ideas and all these dreams, but she’s not really su re what she wants to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cassandra:  I’ve had it!  I’m quitting and I’m not coming back.  I was meant for greater things than working in this pathetic place.   Life is passing me by.

Lazlo:  You can’t quit.  You need the money and you  have responsibilities, remember?

Cassandra:  I’ve sacrificed enough for security.  I  want to make a difference.  I want to do big things.  I want to have an impact on  the world.

Lazlo:  That’s very admirable.  Most people want to  make a difference in the world, but don’t have the guts to try.

Cassandra:  You are so right!  But I’m going to mak e it happen.  I aspire to do great things and I won’t rest until I do.  I want to follow my dream.

Lazlo:  What is your dream?

Cassandra:  Um, well, I’m not quite sure what I’m d estined to do yet, but as soon as I figure out my true vocation, I’m following my heart.

Lazlo:  That’s great.  Until then, lunch break is o ver.  Could we get back to work?

I think Dr. Lucy Tse was meant for writing scripts,  because she does such an admirable job.  Thank you, Lucy.
