This ep isode is a dialogue about vandalism – when someone does something to damage s omeone else’s property. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jim: Did you hear what happened to the Romeros?

Helene: No, what?

Jim: They went on vacation for a week and vandals b roke a couple of windows in the back of their house and tagged their living roo m walls with graffiti.

Helene: That’s terrible! There are always punks who  like to egg houses in this neighborhood for fun, but this is much more serious .

Jim: I think things are getting out of hand. Every week or two, we hear of incidents of people having their tires slashed or t heir cars keyed.

Helene: And the Jamisons had their flowerbeds tramp led and a small fire set on their lawn three weeks ago. This neighborhood is re ally going downhill.

Jim: What should we do about it?

Helene: What do you mean?

Jim: I think we should start patrolling the streets  at night.

Helene: You mean organize a neighborhood watch? Wou ldn’t that be dangerous?

Jim: If you’re worried, when you see something susp icious, call the police.

Helene: And you think they’ll come in time to catch  them? The police aren’t known for quick response times in this neighborhood .

Jim: Then we’ll go after them ourselves.

Helene: You mean be vigilantes? I’m not sure that w ould be wise.

Jim: Why not? If Clint Eastwood can do it, so can I . Go ahead, punk, make my day!

Our dialogue begins with Jim saying to Helene, “Did  you hear what happened to the Romeros?” The “Romeros” refers to a family with  the last name of “Romero.” Notice we put an “s” at the end. That’s very common  if you are referring to an entire family. So, my family might be referred to a s the “McQuillans,” with an “s” at the end. You could also say “the McQuillan famil y.”

Helene says, “No, what?” What happened? Jim says, “ They went on vacation for a week and vandals broke a couple of windows in the  back of their house and tagged their living room walls with graffiti. The R omeros went on a vacation, and while they were gone, “vandals broke a couple of wi ndows.” A “vandal” (vandal) is a criminal who destroys or damages someone’s pro perty, something that belongs to someone else.

These vandals broke a couple of windows in the back  of the Romeros’ house and “tagged” their living room walls with graffiti. “To  tag” (tag) here refers to painting your name or your organization’s name or symbol on a wall. This is something that, unfortunately, you see a lot in big cities al l around the world, usually young men who go around with paint cans and put their nam e – or, often, strange symbols – on public walls or the walls of buildings .

“Graffiti” (graffiti) refers to either writing or d rawing that is placed illegally or without permission on someone’s wall. It could be a lso on someone’s vehicle – on your car, for example. Helene says, “That’s terr ible. There are always punks who like to egg houses in this neighborhood for fun , but this is much more serious.”

The word “punk” (punk) here refers to a young perso n – again, often young men or young boys who break the law and do other things  to bother people around

them. It’s a negative way of describing someone. “P unk” also refers, of course, to a kind of music from the late 1970s, when I was in high school.

Helene says, “There are always punks who like to eg g houses.” “To egg” (egg) means to throw eggs at a building. You’re obviously  throwing raw eggs – eggs that have not been cooked – and of course, if you t hrow an egg against the wall, it’s going to break and make a mess. So, the verb “ to egg” means to throw eggs, but not in a good way (although I’m not sure if the re is a good way to throw eggs at something) but rather in order to create a mess and to damage the wall.

Sometimes, not that often, young people as a joke w ill egg someone’s house. It’s a very bad thing to do. The other thing that young people do sometimes – although I, of course, have never done this – is to  TP someone’s house. “To TP” means to take toilet paper – which is also called “ TP paper” – and throw it on someone’s house, or often on a tree or a bush aroun d someone’s house. Helene says this is much more serious than just egging som eone’s house, because they actually broke into the house.

Jim says, “I think things are getting out of hand.”  The expression “to get out of hand” means to become out of control or to become a  serious problem. We use this expression when a situation seems to be slowly  getting worse until such a point where the problem becomes serious. Jim says, “Every week or two, we hear of incidents of people having their tires slas hed or their cars keyed.” An “incident” is a case of, an event.

In this case, we’re talking about cases of people h aving their tires “slashed.” “To have your tires slashed” (slashed) is to have someo ne take a knife or some sharp object and punch a hole in your tire so that you don’t have any air left in your tire. “To key (key) someone’s car” is to take a key, any key, and walk along the side of the car and scrape the paint off of the  car. Of course, both slashing tires and keying cars would damage a car. It’s cert ainly not something nice to do. You are, in fact, ruining the property of the perso n.

Helene says, “And the Jamisons had their flowerbeds  trampled and a small fire set on their lawn three weeks ago.” A “flower bed” is an area in your lawn or in your garden where there are flowers. “To trample” ( trample) means to step on something, especially a plant, and in doing so kill  the plant or at least flatten the plant so that it is no longer sticking up out of the ground.

Helene continues, “This neighborhood is really goin g downhill.” The expression “to go downhill” (downhill) means to become worse. When you’re talking about a situation going downhill, you are referring to a si tuation that is becoming worse,

that is deteriorating. “To deteriorate” means the s ame as to go downhill – to become worse. Jim then asks, “What should we do abo ut it?” Helene says, “What do you mean?”

Jim says, “I think we should start patrolling the s treets at night.” “To patrol” (patrol) means to either walk or drive around an ar ea to make sure that no one is causing any problems – to look for dangerous or ill egal activities. Normally, we talk about the police patrolling an area to make su re that it is safe. In fact, we call the cars that police drive around “patrol cars” bec ause they are out patrolling. They’re out looking to make sure that the area is s afe. Jim is suggesting that they start patrolling the streets at night.

Helene says, “You mean organize a neighborhood watc h?” A “neighborhood” is an area within a city. “To watch,” of course, means  to look at, to see. A “neighborhood watch,” however, is a group of people  in a certain neighborhood that agree to pay attention, if nothing else, to the area in which they live, and if they see anything that looks wrong – that might be illegal or suspicious – they call the police.

A lot of big American cities have organizations cal led “neighborhood watches” that basically try to make everyone in the neighbor hood aware of who lives there and who doesn’t and to report any problems immediat ely to the police. I mentioned that you look for things that are suspici ous, and that’s exactly what Jim is talking about. Jim says, “If you’re worried,  when you see something suspicious, call the police.” “Suspicious” (suspici ous) is something that makes you think that it may be illegal or harmful, even t hough you’re not exactly sure.

Helene says, “And you think they’ll come in time to  catch them?” Helene doubts that the police would arrive in time in order to ar rest or investigate any problems that she reports. Helene says, “The police aren’t k nown for quick response times in this neighborhood.” A “response time” would be t he amount of time needed for someone to react to something, especially when we’r e talking about the time from which you make a request for police or an ambu lance and the time that the police or the ambulance arrives at your house. That  would be the response time.

Jim says, “Then we’ll go after them ourselves.” “To  go after” someone is a phrasal verb meaning to run after or to pursue some one with the idea of catching the person and holding them and perhaps even punish ing them. “To go after,” more generally, can mean to attack. But here, it re ally means to run after a person and try to catch that person. Helene says, “ You mean be vigilantes? I’m not sure that would be wise.”

Helene doesn’t think it’s wise or a good idea to be come “vigilantes.” A “vigilante” (vigilante) is someone who is not a member of the p olice who tries to catch and punish criminals even though the person doesn’t hav e the legal authority to do that. Jim says, “Why not?” meaning why shouldn’t we  become vigilantes? “If Clint Eastwood can do it, so can I.” Clint Eastwood, as s ome of you may remember, starred in some movies where he played a vigilante.  These were movies back in the 1970s. I’m thinking especially of the movie cal led, in English, Dirty Harry .

Jim finishes our dialogue by using one of the expre ssions, the famous lines, from the Clint Eastwood movie: “Go ahead, punk, make my day!” When you say “go ahead,” you are inviting the other person to do som ething, but sometimes you’re saying it when you don’t really want the person to do something but you’re not going to stop the person from doing it if he wants to. The expression “make my day” is used to challenge someone to a fight.

So, if I have a gun, and you want to punch me with your fist, I may say, “Go ahead, make my day,” meaning if you punch me, I wil l, in this case, shoot you with my gun. “Make my day” normally means to make y ou happy, to do something that makes your day better, but obviously  we’re using it here in a somewhat different way. We’re saying that the oppor tunity to punish you would make me happy – and that, of course, is the way a v igilante might feel, since a vigilante is trying to punish criminals even though  he doesn’t have the authority to do so.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

There’s nothing suspicious or illegal about our scr ipts (I hope). That’s because they’re written by our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.
