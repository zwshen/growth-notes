[start of dialogue]

Victor: Turn off the TV and put down that phone. I know what you’re about to do.

Julia: I wasn’t going to do anything.

Victor: You’re watching the home shopping channel a nd you have the phone in your hand, which means you’re about to call them an d order something. Admit it.

Julia: I just wanted to ask some questions about th is amazing item that’s on- screen right now. It’s 30 percent off if I call wit hin the next eight minutes. Look how nice it looks on the model. It’s a limited edit ion necklace. If I don’t call soon, they’ll be sold out!

Victor: That’s why I have to keep you from calling.  You don’t need another piece of second-rate jewelry from the home shopping chann el.

Julia: Oh, look what you’ve done! They’re sold out.  But hey, look at that machine they’re demonstrating. It’s amazing what it can do.

Victor: You don’t need another ridiculous gadget th at you buy after watching some rigged demonstration. You know that they never  work the same way at home as they do on TV.

Julia: Some of them do. Remember that machine I bou ght for washing nuts? That worked well.

Victor: Yeah, and how much use did we get out of th at? We have an entire garage full of steals you just couldn’t resist. Tha t’s why I need to do something drastic.

Julia: What?

Victor: I’m confiscating that remote!

Victor begins our dialogue by saying to Julia, “Tur n off the TV and put down that phone. I know what you’re about to do.” Victor tell s Julia to stop watching the television and to “put down that phone.” Julia is h olding the phone in her hand. Victor is telling her to put it down, to return it back to the table or the desk where it was sitting before. Victor says, “I know what yo u’re about to do” – I know what you are going to do. That’s what “about to” means h ere.

Julia says, “I wasn’t going to do anything.” Victor  says, “You’re watching the home shopping channel and you have the phone in you r hand, which means you’re about to call them and order something. Admi t it.” “Home shopping” is the practice of purchasing, or buying, things at home –  watching your television and using your telephone to call in and order whatever it is you are buying.

Nowadays in the United States, you can watch your t elevision and they have programs where they are selling things, all sorts o f things – perfume, jewelry, clothing – almost anything you can think of that ca n be sold. They sell it on these “home shopping channels,” these home shopping progr ams. You watch the program and they give you a telephone number to cal l. You call a number, you say, “I want this,” and you give them your credit c ard information, and then they send it to you. That’s what Julia is “about to do.”  That is what she was getting ready to do, what she was going to do.

Victor says, “Admit it.” “Admit (admit) it” is a ph rase we use to force someone to agree with what we have just said, especially when the person doesn’t want to say that it’s true. But you know it’s true, and you ’re trying to get the person to say, “Yes, that is true.” So, for example, you migh t say, “You are afraid to ask Julie on a date, aren’t you? Admit it.” You could s ay that to your friend who is maybe scared of asking a woman out on a date: “Admi t it. You don’t want to ask her, because you’re scared.”

You could use “admit it” in lots of different circu mstances, but it always refers to a case where the person you are talking to doesn’t wa nt to tell the truth, or is

embarrassed or perhaps afraid to tell the truth. Ju lia is not admitting that she was about to call and order something, however. She say s, “I just wanted to ask some questions about this amazing item that’s on-sc reen right now.” “Amazing” means wonderful, great. An “item” (item) is just a thing that is being, in this case, sold. “On-screen” means on the television – showing  on the television right now.

Julia says this item that is on-screen right now – we don’t know what it is – is 30 percent off “if I call within the next eight minute s.” Home shopping channels motivate you to pick up the phone and buy by giving  you a deadline – by saying well, you can get a discount if you buy this item i n the next eight minutes or ten minutes or thirty minutes. That time pressure force s you to make a decision, and it is very effective in getting people to buy. “30 percent off” (off) means a 30 percent discount. That’s what you will get if you b uy this item within the next eight minutes.

Julia says, “Look how nice it looks on the model.” A “model” (model) is a person who is used to show how nice a piece of clothing lo oks, or perhaps a piece of jewelry looks. These home shopping channels are ver y popular with women who are buying clothing and jewelry, or at least it wou ld seem that way based on the kinds of shows that you see there. Julia then tells  us what she’s talking about – she’s talking about a “limited edition necklace.”

A “necklace” is something that you wear around your  neck. Women, especially, often wear necklaces. “Limited edition” means that there are only a small number of these items that have been made and that we are selling. Something that is “limited edition” is something that is not going to  be made in large numbers, in large quantities. Julia says, “If I don’t call soon , they’ll be sold out!” “Sold out” means there are no more left to buy. When an item i s “sold out,” it is no longer available because the storesold all of the items th at it had.

Victor says, “That’s why I have to keep you from ca lling.” That’s why I have to prevent you from calling. “You don’t need another p iece of second-rate jewelry from the home shopping channel.” “Second-rate” (rat e) means inferior in quality – not a very good quality. To call something “second- rate” is to say it’s not very good. If you say something is “first-rate,” then yo u’re saying that it is high quality, it is very good quality. But this jewelry is not ve ry good quality, according to Victor.

Julia says, “Oh, look what you’ve done!” She uses t his expression as a way of blaming Victor for something that happened. He’s do ne something wrong. That’s why she says, “Look what you’ve done. They’re sold out” – there aren’t any more available to buy. Then she says, “But hey, look at that machine they’re

demonstrating” (they’re showing you how to use). “I t’s amazing what it can do.” Victor says, “You don’t need another ridiculous gad get that you buy after watching some rigged demonstration.”

A “gadget” (gadget) is a small device, a small tool  or machine that usually has one limited use. I remember it used to be very popu lar for people to buy a little machine that you would use to make hamburgers. That ’s all really it did. It made hamburgers. It was like a hot plate. It was like tw o hot pieces of metal that you put on either side of the beef and you would use it  to make a hamburger. These were very popular 20, 30 years ago.

Also very popular were special machines that made p opcorn. When I was growing up, in the ‘70s and ‘80s, everybody had the se machines that only made popcorn. That’s really all you could do with it. Of  course, you could make popcorn in other ways with a regular pan, but these machine s were very popular because, I guess, everyone needed to eat popcorn in the ‘70’ s. I don’t know.

Well, these home shopping networks, these home shop ping channels, sell a lot of these machines – these small tools or gadgets th at make things that aren’t always the most useful. Victor doesn’t want Julia t o buy one of these. He says that the demonstration that she is watching on tele vision is rigged. When something is “rigged” (rigged), it has somehow been  made to look better than it is. It’s not authentic. It’s not real.

If A contest has been rigged, the results of the co ntest cannot be trusted because someone has done something to make it unfair, to ma ke it so that it’s not a real contest. If you pay a boxer a million dollars to lo se his next fight, that would be rigging the competition. That would be rigging the contest so that it’s not a real contest. That’s what Victor is saying is happening with these demonstrations on television – they’re not real. They’re not legitima te demonstrations.

Victor says, “You know that they never work the sam e way at home as they do on TV.” He’s saying these gadgets never work as wel l when you get them in your own house as they do when you are watching them on television. Julia says, “Some of them do.” She disagrees with Victor. “Reme mber that machine I bought for washing nuts? That worked well.” Julie apparent ly bought a machine that did nothing but washed nuts, a kind of food. Julia says  that machine worked well.

Victor says, “Yeah,” meaning yes, “and how much use  did we get out of that?” meaning how much did we actually use it? Victor goe s on and says, “We have an entire garage full of steals you just couldn’t resi st. That’s why I need to do something drastic.” A “steal” (steal) here means a bargain, something that you

bought for a very low price. “To resist” means to a void doing something, to stop yourself from doing something. “Drastic” (drastic) is extreme or severe.

Victor says that Julia cannot “resist,” cannot stop  herself from buying things she thinks are “steals,” or good deals. That’s why he h as to do something extreme, something that he wouldn’t normally have to do in o rder to stop Julia from buying more things. Julia says, “What?” Victor says, “I’m confiscating that remote!” “To confiscate” (confiscate) means to take something aw ay so that another person can no longer use it or have it. It’s a verb normal ly used when we’re talking about the police taking illegal drugs from someone, or pe rhaps the teacher taking something away from a student that the student shou ldn’t have.

Victor is going to confiscate the “remote” (remote) . The “remote” is the remote control. It’s that small device that you use to cha nge the channels on your television or to turn the volume up and down. Many years ago, of course, we didn’t have remote controls. You actually had to ge t out of your chair and walk over to the television and turn the channel or turn  the volume up or down. Oh, the good old days.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
