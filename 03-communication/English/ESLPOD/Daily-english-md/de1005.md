Jenny: Okay, now I know you’re buttering me up. Wha t gives?

Anton: Nothing, nothing at all. You’re so suspiciou s. I’m just giving you my candid opinion.

The title of this episode is “Complimenting Your Ho st.” “To compliment” (compliment) means to say nice things about someone . “Oh, those are very beautiful shoes you have on,” or “That’s a really n ice haircut.” Those are compliments – when you say something nice about som eone, or someone’s house, or someone’s car, or something that person o wns. You might even compliment someone’s children: “What a very smart y oung son you have.”

A “host” (host) is a person who has some party or s ome event, and is responsible for running the event and usually talking to people  and welcoming them to this party or event. You could also have a host just for  a dinner at your house. You may have five or six of your friends over. You woul d be the host of the party, or the host of the dinner.

The host isn’t always the person who organizes the event, but for a dinner or a small party it typically would be. Technically, the  host is the person who is there to greet people as they come in – to talk to them, to make them feel welcome. We use the word “host” also in talking about televi sion, radio, or podcasting. The person who is running the program, the person who is in front of the microphone, we might say, or in front of the camera – he or she  is the host of the program.

Anton begins the dialogue by saying to Jenny, “You’ ve outdone yourself. This is quite a spread.” “To outdo yourself” means to do be tter than anyone expected you to do, to do better even than you expected to d o. Anton says, “This is quite a spread” (spread). A “spread” is when you have a lot  of food placed on a table. To say “it’s quite a spread” means there’s a lot of fo od or a lot of very good food there. Jenny says, “Thank you. I’m glad you approve .” I’m glad you think so. Anton says, “Approve? I think everything on this ta ble looks exquisite and mouthwatering.”

These are both adjectives we might use to describe good food. The first is “exquisite” (exquisite). Something that is exquisit e is something that is very refined, something that is perhaps – when not talki ng about food, at least – elegant. Here it means it tastes really, really goo d. Similarly, the term “mouthwatering” refers to something that tastes ver y good. It’s very appetizing.

“Exquisite” is a more general adjective that can be  used in lots of different circumstances. “Mouthwatering,” however, refers spe cifically to food.

Jenny says, “That’s nice of you to say. I wanted ev erything to be perfect.” Anton says, “You’ve surpassed all expectations.” “To surp ass” (surpass) means to go beyond something. “To surpass all expectations” mea ns to do better than anyone expected you to do. It’s quite similar to the expre ssion we had earlier, “to outdo yourself.”

Anton says, “If this food tastes even half as good as it looks, you’ll wow every guest.” Anton is saying that the food looks wonderf ul. If it tastes as good as it looks – or even half as good as it looks – “you’ll wow every guest.” “To wow” (wow) is an informal verb meaning to really impress  or surprise someone. “We’re going to wow our clients” – we’re going to make the m think this is wonderful. “Wow” is also what we would call an “interjection.”  When we see something very surprising, whether it’s good or bad, we’ll often s ay, “Wow.”

I once brought my computer in to be fixed, and the person looking at it was looking at the computer, and about every 30 seconds  or so she said wow. “Wow.” Now, that’s not what you want someone who’s fixing your computer to say, because she’s very surprised at something, and  if the computer is broken, it means she’s surprised at something that’s very bad.  And that’s not the kind of thing you want to hear. But “wow” is often used in a positive way to mean that you are surprised at a good thing. Here it’s defini tely used, as a verb, to mean make a positive impression on people.

Jenny says, “If you don’t stop complimenting me, I won’t be able to stop blushing.” “To blush” (blush) means for your cheeks , your face, to become pink or red because you’re embarrassed. That’s the idea of blushing. You blush when someone says something you find embarrassing. Some people, when you compliment them a lot, may blush. They may blush be cause they think you are being too kind – too nice, perhaps.

Anton says, “I’m only just beginning, because you’r e a vision in that dress.” Now Anton goes from complimenting her food to complemen ting her. He says, “You’re a vision in that dress.” If you describe someone as  a vision, you’re describing them as a beautiful person, someone who has a wonde rful appearance, we might say.

Jenny says, “Oh,” this is “nothing special.” Anton says, disagreeing with her, “Of course it’s special, but you could wear a sack and look ravishing.” A “sack” (sack) is like a bag that you would carry something in, ma de of paper or perhaps cloth.

Anton is saying here that even if Jenny was just we aring something ugly – something that isn’t even clothing, like a sack – s he would still look ravishing. “Ravishing” (ravishing) means very beautiful. It’s often used to describe a woman who is very beautiful, very attractive.

Jenny says, “Okay, now I know you’re buttering me u p.” “To butter (butter) someone up” is a phrasal verb meaning to say nice t hings to someone because you want that person to do something for you. Jenny  thinks Anton is buttering her up because he wants something from her. So, she ask s him, “What gives?” This is an informal phrase we use when you want to know what is really happening when someone doesn’t seem to be straightforward wit h you, when someone doesn’t seem to be direct with you. You may say, “W hat gives?” What’s really going on here?

Anton says, “Nothing, nothing at all. You’re so sus picious.” “To be suspicious” (suspicious) means to be distrustful, to not believ e or not trust someone. Anton says, “I’m just giving you my candid opinion.” “Can did” (candid) means truthful, honest, not deceptive. There was a television show on for many years called Candid Camera . There, “candid” referred more to not prepared, no t posed. Candid Camera  was actually a secret camera that they would put s omewhere, and then the person who was the host of the show wo uld do something crazy, or have people do something crazy, and then see how pe ople reacted.

“Candid” when used in talking about photographs mea ns that you’re not stopping and looking at the camera and trying to look a cert ain way. It’s when someone takes photographs of people who are not often aware  that someone is taking a photograph of them. That would be a “candid.” Here,  however, it means really honest. When we talk about giving our “candid opini on,” we’re talking about giving our honest opinion.

Jenny says, “If you say so.” She doesn’t really bel ieve Anton. “Where’s the camera you borrowed from me for your trip? Did you bring it?” Now we learn that Anton had borrowed a camera from Jenny, and maybe s omething happened to the camera and Anton doesn’t have it anymore. That’ s what Jenny thinks. Anton says, “Ah, the camera.” Then he changes the subject . “Did I mention how much I admire that necklace you’re wearing?” “To admire” ( admire) means to really like something, to really approve of something, to think  that it’s great.

Anton admires her necklace – the thing she’s wearin g around her neck, a piece of jewelry she’s wearing around her neck. He, of co urse, is trying to change the subject because Jenny is probably right. Something happened to the camera,

and that’s why Anton is being so nice to Jenny – so  Jenny won’t be mad at him for losing or perhaps  damaging her camera.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Anton: Jenny, you’ve outdone yourself. This is quit e a spread.

Jenny: Thank you. I’m glad you approve.

Anton: Approve? I think everything on this table lo oks exquisite and mouthwatering.
