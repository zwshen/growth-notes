[start of dialogue] 

Ruth: I’m really glad you’re getting so much suppor t from the public. Look at all of these bags of fan mail. 

Carl: Only about half of that is fan mail. The rest  is hate mail. 

Ruth: Hate mail? Who would send you hate mail? 

Carl: Lots of people. People who are disgruntled wr ite to me about their grievances.  

Ruth: Really? 

Carl: Don’t look so surprised. We’ve gotten bomb th reats, and I’ve even received a few death threats. 

Ruth: Death threats?! Aren’t you worried about your  personal safety? 

Carl: Not really. Most people are just venting, and  others are trying to intimidate me. I’m not going to buckle under just because I ge t a few letters. 

Ruth: But it only takes one mentally unbalanced per son to carry through on threats. Have you considered getting a bodyguard? 

Carl: No, I don’t need any protection. I just need to keep plugging away and getting things done.  

Ruth: I finally know what to get you for your birth day. 

Carl: What? 

Ruth: A bulletproof vest. [end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Ruth saying to Carl, “I’m really glad you’re getting so much support from the public. Look at all these bag s of fan mail.” A “fan” here refers to a person who likes a certain thing or a c ertain other person, usually a famous person. You can be a fan of a sport like bas eball or soccer. “Fan mail” refers to letters that a famous person, typically, receives from people who like that person, who admire that person, who say nice t hings about that person.  

Carl says, “Only about half of that is fan mail. Th e rest is hate mail.” “Hate (hate) mail” are letters that express anger or disgust for  a person. If you really don’t like a person, you might send them hate mail. Well, I do n’t think you should. “Hate,” of course, is a feeling of anger and of dislike for  another person, a very strong feeling of that. “Hate mail” is something that cele brities – famous people – get, as well as fan mail. Ruth is surprised. She says, “Hat e mail? Who would send you hate mail?”  

Carl says, “Lots of people. People who are disgrunt led write to me about their grievances.” “To be disgruntled” (disgruntled) mean s to be upset – to be unhappy about some situation or dissatisfied with something . “Grievances” (grievances) are complaints, statements, or descriptions of some thing you don’t like, some problem that you’re having. The word “grievance” is  somewhat more formal than “complaint.” Ruth says, “Really?” Again, she’s surp rised. Carl says, “Don’t look so surprised,” meaning don’t be surprised. “We’ve g otten bomb threats, and I’ve even received a few death threats.”  

A “threat” (threat) is a statement that you are goi ng to hurt someone or harm someone. It’s a warning that you are going to do so mething bad to another person. Sometimes people use threats to prevent peo ple from doing things. “If you do X, I will hurt you.” You’re trying to preven t them from doing something by threatening them. A “bomb threat” is when someone s ays that they are planting an explosive device, a bomb that may go off – may e xplode – and hurt or even kill people.   

“Death threats” are when people say, “I’m going to kill you” – when they tell someone that they will be murdered, basically. Unfo rtunately, there are people in the world that do that sort of thing. Ruth is again  very surprised. She says, “Death threats?! Aren’t you worried about your pers onal safety?” “Personal (personal) safety” refers to the risk of you being injured or even killed. If you go into certain parts of American cities at night, you  might fear for your personal safety. You may fear that someone will hurt you or even kill you. The best thing is to stay away from those places.  

Carl, however, is not worried about his personal sa fety. He says, “Most people are just venting, and others are trying to intimida te me.” “To vent” (vent) here means to express one’s frustrations or dissatisfact ion – to say a lot of things that will or may not be true, but it makes you feel bett er if you say it, if you complain about a certain thing. Sometimes when people get an gry, they just need to vent. They just need to get all that anger out by saying things that they don’t like, even if some of those things aren’t really true.  

Carl says these people who write hate mail and send  him hate mail are “just venting.” Others, however are trying to intimidate him. “To intimidate” (intimidate) means to make someone feel frightened or inferior b y showing that you are bigger or better or smarter than that person. If so meone intimidates you, that person makes you feel afraid, perhaps even for your  personal safety.  

Carl says, “I’m not going to buckle under just beca use I got a few letters.” The phrasal verb “to buckle (buckle) under” means to fa il to support yourself in some way or to fail to continue doing what you were doin g because you felt pressure or, perhaps, because you were intimidated. “To buck le under” means to agree to do something also that you don’t want to do, but yo u are forced to do it. You are pressured to do it. Carl says he’s not going to buc kle under just because he got a few letters.  

Ruth says, “But it only takes one mentally unbalanc ed person to carry through on threats.” “Mentally unbalanced” refers to someone w ho has some sort of mental illness – someone who is a bit crazy, quite frankly . “To carry through on” something is a phrasal verb meaning to follow a pla n through to completion, to do something from start to finish, to actually do what  you say you’re going to do. Ruth is afraid that some mentally unbalanced person  is going to carry through on these threats – is going to actually harm Carl.  

Ruth asks, “Have you considered,” have you thought about, “getting a bodyguard?” A “bodyguard” (bodyguard) is a person w hose job it is to provide security for another person, to keep another person  safe. Some of you may  

remember a movie with Kevin Costner and Whitney Hou ston called The Bodyguard , about a famous singer’s bodyguard. It was a horri ble movie, but if you saw it, you know what I mean.  

Carl then says, “No, I don’t need any protection.” “Protection” is anything that keeps you away from danger or that prevents you fro m being hurt. Carl says, “I just need to keep plugging away and getting things done.” “To plug (plug) away” means to continue to do something, especially to co ntinue to do something that may not seem important that you may have to do over  and over again, but that has to be done. We often use this phrasal verb when  we’re doing something that isn’t very interesting or perhaps even very difficu lt, but has to be done. You plug away at it.  

Ruth then says, “I finally know what to get you for  your birthday.” Carl says, “What?” Ruth says, “A bulletproof vest.” A “vest” ( vest) is a piece of clothing you wear like a jacket, except it doesn’t have any arms  – technically, it doesn’t have any sleeves, which are the parts of a shirt or jack et that cover your arms. A “bullet“ (bullet) is a small piece of metal that is  fired from a gun. “Bulletproof” (bulletproof) means that whatever it is, will preve nt a bullet from, in this case, going into your body.  

A “bulletproof vest” is worn by police officers and  other people in case someone tries to shoot them. The vest will stop the bullet.  It will make sure the bullet doesn’t enter into the body of the person. You can also have “bulletproof glass” – very thick glass that even if you shot a bullet at it would not break. Most banks in Los Angeles, for example, have bulletproof glass. I n order to talk to someone, you have to talk to someone who’s on the other side  of the bulletproof glass. They don’t wear bulletproof vests in the bank, I do n’t think.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
