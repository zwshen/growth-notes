This episode is called “Making Quick and Slow Decisions.”  It ’s a dialogue between Courteney and Dante; they’re going to be tal king about some business decisions that they need to make.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Courteney:  Which of these vendors do you think we should g o with?

Dante:  I’m really hesitant to make a decision until we’ ve pondered the options a little longer.  We don’t want to make any rash decisions.

Courteney:  We’ve sat on this for long enough, don’t you  think?  I know you’re of two minds about whether we should be switching vendors in  the middle of the year, but I think it’s the right move.  We had sound re asons for doing this, remember?

Dante:  Yes, yes, I know that it wasn’t a split-second deci sion, but whether it’ll really save us money is debatable.

Courteney:  I have to disagree with you there.  We’ve bo th seen the reports and I don’t think there are any ifs, ands, or buts about it.  We’re going to save money.

Dante:  Okay, I’m willing to make a tentative decision to  go with GreatDeal Corp. as our new vendor, as long as that decision isn’t set in sto ne.  We’ll revisit this decision in six months to see if they’re working out.

Courteney:  I can live with that.  Now, can we discuss my ra ise?

 Dante:  Raise?  That’s definitely something I’ll need t o ponder a lot more.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Courteney asking Dante, “Which of these vendors do you think we should go with?”  A “vendor” (vendor) is a  company that sells things to other companies instead of directly to you, the consume r.  So if you are a business and you need to buy paper, you would buy paper fr om another company that makes paper.  So, that’s when a vendor is.  At the end of Courteney’s question she says, “Which of these vendors do you  think we should go with?”  This is an interesting, two-word phrasal expr ession; “to go with” means to choose a particular a particular product or a particu lar service, to choose to have or use this thing.  You can use this for almost any cas e where there is a choice between two or more things.  Someone says, “Do you  like the chicken or the beef?” and you say, “Oh, I’ll go with the beef.”  That is what I am selecting.

So, Courteney wants to know which vendor they are select ing.  Dante says, “I’m really hesitant to make a decision until we’ve pondered t he options a little longer.” “I’m really hesitant” means that I don’t want to do som ething.  I don’t want to make this decision because I’m not sure; I need to think ab out it some more. “Hesitant” comes from the verb “to hesitate” (hesitate) which means the same thing, not to do something.  There’s an expression: “H e who hesitates is lost,” meaning if you hesitate often you will lose the opport unity to do something.  This is especially true when it comes to romance and trying to f ind a romantic partner. If you see a beautiful woman across the room and you hesi tate, well, someone else may get to her first.  Unless, of course, she’s marrie d; in that case you should find another room!

Dante is hesitant to make a decision until we’ve pondere d the options.  “To ponder” (ponder) is another way of saying to think about  something very seriously, to consider something.  He wants to ponder the  options a little longer – a little more time.  He says, “We don’t want to make an y rash decisions.” Something that is “rash” (rash) is something that is done  or decided very quickly, so quickly that you may easily make a mistake.  That’s “rash”  as an adjective. “Rash” has some other meanings in English, and those you ca n find in this episode’s Learning Guide.

Well, Dante is hesitant but Courteney is not.  She says, “ We’ve sat on this for long enough, don’t you think?”  “To sit on (something) ” here means to spend a lot of time thinking about something before you make your de cision.  It can also be

 used sometimes to mean to purposely not take any action to  prevent something from happening.  So your friend asks his mother if the t wo of you can go to a movie, and your friend’s mother says, “Well, I need to th ink about it.  I’ll tell you tomorrow.”  We could say she’s sitting on that decision; she’s not making the decision because she really doesn’t want you two to be go ing to the movies together.

Well, Courteney thinks they have sat on the decision about  the new vendor long enough.  She says, “I know you’re of two minds about whet her we should be switching vendors in the middle of the year.”  “To be of two minds” means to be undecided, to be able to see the positive things – the advantages of one option but also the advantages of another option and you can’t decide.  That’s to be of two minds.  “To switch” means to change from one thing to another, to stop using this and start using that.  “I used to jog outside, and then I switched to a treadmill,” which is a machine that goes around that al lows you to run or walk inside.  That’s to switch.

Courteney says Dante is of two minds about whether they sh ould be switching vendors (changing vendors) in the middle of the year.  “B ut, she says, “I think it’s the right move (the right decision; the correct decision).   We had sound reasons for doing this,” she says.  When you say, as an adjective, so mething is “sound,” you mean it’s logical, it’s rational, it is something th at you have thought about for a long time and it makes sense, it’s correct.

Dante says, “Yes, yes, I know that it wasn’t a split-second de cision.”  A “split- second decision” is a decision made very quickly, without havin g a lot of time to think about it.  Dante is saying that this decision was not  a split-second decision. But, he says, he’s not sure if will really save them money.  He says, “whether it’ll really save us money is debatable.”  Something that is “de batable” is something that you can have more than one opinion about; there i sn’t a definite answer, different opinions could be correct; it is something th at you need to discuss more. “Debatable” comes from the verb “to debate,” which is t o argue or talk about something with two people having different opinions.

Courteney says, “I have to disagree with you there.”  The  “there” here means with what you just said.  “I have to disagree with you th ere.  We’ve both seen the reports (the information) and I don’t think there are any ifs, ands, or buts about it.” This is an interesting expression: “there are no ifs, ands,  or buts about it.”  This means that there are no reasons for not doing somethin g, there aren’t any reasons for not doing something, there’re no excuses.  Yo u may be going to the store with your friends, and your husband says, “I want you  home by 10:00

 tonight.  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.”  Of course, who listens to husbands, right?

Courteney says that they are going to save money, and ther e are no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Dante says, “Okay, I’m willing to make a t entative decision.” Something that is “tentative” is something that isn’t yet  final; it’s still something you could change later.  It’s almost like a temporary decisi on; you’ll make a final decision later.  Dante says that they are going to go wi th (they are going to select) GreatDeal Corp. (GreatDeal Corporation) as our  new vendor, as long as that decision isn’t set in stone.  The expression “to be set (set) in stone” means to be final, to be clearly determined, clearly agreed upon .  You can’t change it anymore – to be set in stone.  He says, “We’ll revisit thi s decision in six months.” “To revisit” in this case means we will think about this de cision again; we will analyze, discuss, and consider our decision again in six months.   Dante wants to see if this new vendor is going to work out.  “To work o ut” is a two-word phrasal verb that means to be successful, to do what they say they are going to do.  This actually is an expression that has different meanings in En glish, and those are, of course, in the Learning Guide.

Courteney says, “I can live with that.”  “To live with ( something)” in this case means to be able to accept a situation even though it’s d ifficult or it’s not exactly what you want; to be able to handle a situation, we m ight also say to be able to tolerate to a situation.  Courteney says, “I can live with  that (I can live with that decision).  Now, can we discuss my raise?”  A “raise” (rais e), as a noun, in this case means an increase in the amount of money that you ma ke – that a company pays you to do a particular job.

Courteney wants a raise.  Dante says, “Raise?  That’s defin itely something I’ll need to ponder a lot more,” meaning he is not going to make a decision about giving her more money until he has more time to think about it.  Sounds like my boss!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Courteney:  Which of these vendors do you think we should g o with?

Dante:  I’m really hesitant to make a decision until we’ ve pondered the options a little longer.  We don’t want to make any rash decisions.
