# Being Under Stress

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 319: Being Under Stress.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 319.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Visit our website at eslpod.com.  We have some new features on our website, new courses in our ESL Podcast Store, and a new blog that you can follow every day to learn even more English.  In this episode, we’re going to have a dialogue between two people, one of whom is having problems because he is under stress.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Wei:  What’s wrong?  You look like you’re in pain.  Jason:  My stomach is acting up again.  Wei:  It’s all of this stress.  I don’t know how anyone can cope with the pressures you’re under.  Jason:  It’s nothing.  I’ll just take a pill for my stomach.  Wei:  That won’t solve the problem.  Look at you.  You look worn out.  Are you losing sleep, too?  Jason:  I have had trouble sleeping.  Wei:  It’s no wonder.  At home, you have the demands of raising two kids on your own, and at work, you’re in a dog-eat-dog environment everyday.  Jason:  I have to admit that my nerves are shot, but what can I do?    Wei:  Maybe we can work something out.  To start, how about if I watch your kids for a few hours this weekend so you can get some rest?  Jason:  I couldn’t ask you to do that.  You have to take care of your own kids.
