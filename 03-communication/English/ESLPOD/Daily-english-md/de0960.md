[start of dialogue]

Jimmy: My cousin Sal said that he put in an applica tion for a job here.

Suzanne: Yeah, that’s right.

Jimmy: Well?

Suzanne: Well, what?

Jimmy: Are you going to hire him?

Suzanne: I’m not sure. He doesn’t have any experien ce and he didn’t provide any references.

Jimmy: I can vouch for him. Sal is solid. He’s a re ally nice guy.

Suzanne: I appreciate you putting in a good word for him, but I need more assurance than that he’s a nice guy. He needs to ha ve the temperament, work ethic, and skills for this job.

Jimmy: What he doesn’t know he’ll learn on the job.  He’s a quick study.

Suzanne: How can I justify hiring someone with no e xperience, while passing up applicants who are better qualified?

Jimmy: He has my ringing endorsement. What else do you need? He’ll work as hard as I do.

Suzanne: That’s exactly what I’m afraid of.

Our dialogue between Jimmy and Suzanne begins by Ji mmy saying, “My cousin Sal said that he put in an application for a job he re.” “To put in an application” means to apply for a job or something that you are hoping to get from a company or an organization. Normally, we use this expressio n when we’re talking about applying for a job. You want to get a job at a cert ain company, so you go and you “put in an application.” You fill out a form. You g ive them your name, your address, who you work for now, and so forth.

Suzanne said, “Yeah, that's right,” meaning that is  correct. She knows that Jimmy's cousin Sal put in an application. Jimmy say s, “Well?” He's expecting Suzanne to give him some news about this applicatio n. Suzanne, however, doesn't want to give him the information, or perhap s doesn't think Jimmy should be asking about it. She says, “Well, what?” We use that expression – “Well, what?” – when confused about what the other person wants. Suzanne isn’t sure what Jimmy is asking her. Jimmy says, “Are you goin g to hire him?” “To hire” (hire) means to give someone a job.

Suzanne says, “I'm not sure. He doesn't have any ex perience and he didn't provide any references.” Suzanne says that Sal “doe sn't have any experience” – he hasn't worked in this kind of job before, the ki nd of job he's applying for. He also didn't provide any “references” (references). A “reference” is the name and, usually, telephone number or email of someone who c an give the company information about you and how good of a worker you are. Those are what we would call “professional references” – people who c an give information about your qualifications.

Sometimes, for example, if you are trying to rent a n apartment, you may have to provide what we call “personal references.” A “pers onal reference” would be a friend or a family member who can tell the person r enting the apartment whether you are a good person or not – whether you cause pr oblems. However, in this case, we’re talking about professional references. Suzanne says Sal didn't provide any. He didn't give any names and telephone  numbers.

 Jimmy says, “I can vouch for him. Sal is solid. He' s a really nice guy.” “To vouch (vouch) for” someone is to indicate that you know t his person is a good person and that the person you are talking to can believe you. It's a way of indicating to someone that this person is a good person and that you can trust me – I know. I know this person; I will vouch for him or vouch for  her.

Jimmy says that Sal is “solid” (solid). When we say  a person is “solid,” we mean he is a good person. He is a reliable person. He is  a trustworthy person. The word “solid” is used in this way when we’re talking  about a person. It's different when we’re talking about a physical object like the  table. That's a different kind of solid. When you talk about a person being solid, yo u mean they’re a good person. They’re a trustworthy person.

Suzanne says, “I appreciate you putting in a good w ord for him, but I need more assurance than that he's a nice guy.” “To put in a good word for” someone means to say something good about a person or to re commend a person, often in an informal way. You know someone, for example, who is looking for a  job, and you know that there is a job at the company where you work. You m ight say to this person – a friend, perhaps – “I'll put in a good word for you. ” That means I will say nice things about you to the boss – the person responsib le for hiring for this particular position.

Notice, “to put in application” and “to put in a go od word” are both uses of the phrasal verb “to put in,” but in different circumst ances and with different meanings. Suzanne says she needs “more assurance.” “Assurance” (assurance) means words or actions that make you feel certain a bout something – that make you feel that something will happen in a certain wa y. “I want assurance that you are going to pay me every month.” You need to give me evidence. You need to give me proof. You need to do something or say some thing that shows me that you will pay your bill every month. That's an examp le of “assurance.”

Don't confuse this with “insurance” (insurance). “I nsurance” is something you buy from a company in case you have an accident or a pr oblem. The company will then pay for your expenses. We have “health insuran ce” and “car insurance” and “home insurance.” All those are very different than  the word we're talking about here, which is an “assurance.” Suzanne continues, “ He needs to have the temperament, work ethic, and skills for this job.” “Temperament” (temperament) refers to your personality or your personal charact eristics that seem to be permanent – that you always have.

Some people have a very happy temperament. They’re always happy. It doesn't matter what's happening; they’re always smiling and  joking and having a good time. That would be their temperament. Suzanne says  this person has to have the temperament for this job, whatever this job is – we don't know. “Work ethic” (ethic) is your commitment to work hard. Someone wh o has a “good work ethic” comes to work on time, works hard, never goofs off,  doesn't listen to podcasts at work – that would be someone with a good work ethic . Like you.

“Skills” would be abilities or things that you are able to do for the job. Jimmy says, “What he doesn't know, he'll learn on the job . He's a quick study.” To learn something or do something “on the job” means after you are hired, after you start working at that position. Jimmy says, “Don't worry”  – his cousin is “a quick study.” The expression “quick study” is used to describe a person who can learn things very quickly, who doesn't need a lot of instruction  or help. Suzanne says, “How can I justify hiring someone with no experience, wh ile passing up applicants who are better qualified?”

“To justify” (justify) means to provide a logical r eason for something, to be able to explain, usually to someone higher up in the compan y, why you did what you did. Suzanne says she cannot justify “hiring someone wit h no experience, while passing up applicants who are better qualified.” “T o pass up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to choose not to do something or, in this case, to choose not to select someone. “To be qualified” means to h ave the skills to do something, to have the experience and ability to ac complish a certain task or do a certain job.

Jimmy says that his cousin has his “ringing endorse ment.” A “ringing (ringing) endorsement” is very strong praise for someone – wh en you say something about a person that suggests that they are wonderfu l, that they can do whatever you want them to do. It's often used when we are re commending someone or something to another person. It's often used when w e are talking about recommending someone for a job, as is the case in o ur dialogue.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
