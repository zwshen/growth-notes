This episode is called “Buying Men’s Shirts.”  It’s a dialo gue between Francesca and Eddie using a lot of vocabulary that you would need to know to buy a shirt for a man.  Let’s get shopping!

[start of dialogue]

Francesca:  Hurry up!  Come out of that fitting room so  I can see how the dress shirt fits.

Eddie:  The first one didn’t fit at all.  The sleeves were too short and it was too form fitting.  I like my shirts to be on the roomy side.   I’m trying on the second one.

Francesca:  Come on, let me see.  Okay, I think this one f its you pretty well.  The collar is the right size, not too loose or tight.  The cu ffs on this one fall at just the right place, don’t you think?

Eddie:  Yeah, it’s fine.

Francesca:  Try on the T-shirts.

Eddie:  Okay, but I’m not trying on the fancy ones with a  V-neck.  I like my T- shirts the old-fashioned way – with a crew neck.

Francesca:  All right, but try on the short-sleeve and the long-sleeve ones, too. Hurry up.

 Eddie:  Hold on, I’m changing as fast as I can.  Oh, ge ez.  I’ve heard of oversized T-shirts, but this is ridiculous.

Francesca:  Let me see.  You’re right.  You’ve got enou gh room in there for two people!

Our dialogue begins with Francesca saying to Eddie, “Hurr y up (meaning go faster)!  Come out of that fitting room so I can see h ow the dress shirt fits.”  A “fitting room” is a small room with a door where you ca n try on clothing.  You can take off your clothing that you are wearing, in a store,  and put on the new clothing – the clothing you are deciding whether you are  going to buy or not. Usually, the fitting room has a mirror so you can look a t yourself.  Most stores that sell clothing have fitting rooms; sometimes they’re ca lled “dressing rooms,” but “fitting room” is the more common expression.

Francesca says that she wants Eddie to come out so she can see  the dress shirt and how it fits.  A “dress shirt” is a nice men’s shirt, som ething that you would wear for work in an office, something a little more fo rmal, usually with buttons down the front.  The verb “to fit,” when we’re talki ng about clothing, means to be the right size for your body.  So if someone says, “These  pants don’t fit, they’re too small,” what they are saying is the pants are not ri ght for me, I can’t wear them, they’re not the right size – because I’m so fat, yo u see!  “Fit” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Le arning Guide for some additional explanations.

Eddie says, “The first one didn’t fit at all.”  It didn ’t fit him; it wasn’t the right size for him.  He says, “The sleeves were too short and it was too form fitting.”  The “sleeve” is the part of the shirt that covers your arms, fr om your shoulder to, usually, your wrist, right above your hand.  Sometimes, i f it’s a “short-sleeve shirt,” the sleeve only goes down to right above your elb ow.  He says the shirt is too form fitting.  Something that is “too form fitti ng” means it’s too tight; it fits against your body too closely, usually showing the shape of yo ur body better. But if you don’t have a body that is in good shape, well , you really don’t want anyone to see it, so form fitting is a bad thing if you  don’t have a good body, and a good thing if you do.  Eddie says, “I like my shirts to be on the roomy side.” “Roomy” means lots of extra space, big.  The expression “to be on the (something) side,” in this case “on the roomy side,” means to be a little bit (this particular adjective), so a little bit roomy – a little bit on the roomy side.  You could say, “That car is a little bit on the expensive side, ” meaning it’s too

 expensive.  Eddie says to Francesca, “I’m trying on the secon d one.”  “To try on” means to put, in this case, a piece of clothing on you to see if you like it or not.

Eddie is still inside the fitting room; he’s talking to Francesca over the door. Francesca says, “Come on, let me see.”  She wants to have him open the door and come out so she can see him.  Then she says, “Okay, I th ink this one fits you pretty well.  The collar is the right size, not too loose  or tight.”  The “collar” is the part of the shirt that is that is up against your neck, of ten closed with a button.  To be “loose” means that you are able to move it back and f orth; there’s a lot of room.  To be “tight” means not to be able to move some thing back and forth, to be too small.  She’s saying that the collar is not too lo ose and not too tight.  “The cuffs,” she says, “on this one (on this shirt) fall at just the right place.”  The “cuff” (cuff) is at the very end of your sleeve on a formal or dr ess shirt.  Usually there’s a button to close the sleeve, or on a very formal shirt you  can wear what are called “cufflinks,” which are little pieces of metal that  you put on and it serves the same function as a button.  Francesca says the cuff falls at j ust the right place. To “fall,” here, means to hang, to rest without any sup port below.  What she’s really saying here is that the cuff goes down to the righ t length; it’s the right length for his arm.  “Fall” has several different meani ngs in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations

Eddie says, “Yeah, it’s fine.”  Then Francesca says, “Try on the T-shirts.”  Eddie says, “Okay, but I’m not trying on the fancy ones with a V- neck.  I like my T-shirts the old-fashioned way – with a crew neck.”  “T-shirts” are  informal shirts, or shirts, usually white, that you wear underneath a forma l shirt.  They can be either “V-neck,” meaning that the collar, the part by the neck, goes down in the shape of a “V” in front, or they can be “crew (crew) neck,” wh ich means that they’re perfectly round.  So we have V-neck T-shirts and crew neck T- shirts.  Don’t confuse “crew neck” with another expression, “crew cut.”  A  “crew cut” is when you have your hair cut very short, like is often common for m en when they go into the army.  The government cuts their hair in a crew cut – very short hair.  This is a “crew neck,” meaning a round collar on a shirt or on a  T-shirt.

Francesca says, “All right, but try on the short-sleeve and long-sleeve ones, too.” As we said earlier, a “short-sleeve shirt” is a shirt whe re the sleeve only goes down beyond the shoulder, between the shoulder and the elbow.  A “long-sleeve shirt” is a shirt where the sleeve goes all the way down to the wrist, down to the hand.

Eddie says, “Hold on, I’m changing as fast as I can.”  Fra ncesca wants him to go faster.  Then he says, “Oh, geez (oh, goodness – oh, dear ).  I’ve heard of oversized T-shirts, but this is ridiculous.”  Something tha t is “oversized” is

 something that is bigger than necessary, something that is too big.  Eddie is using another common expression in daily conversation: “I’ve  heard of (something), but this is ridiculous.”  “I’ve heard of it snowing outside, but this is ridiculous.  There is five feet of snow on the ground.”  That form of an expression is used to express how you think this is excessive – this is unu sual, this situation.

Francesca says, “Let me see.  You’re right.  You’ve got en ough room in there for two people!”  Francesca agrees with Eddie that the shirt  is too big; it’s oversized. She says he has enough room – enough space in there for two people, that’s how big the shirt is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
