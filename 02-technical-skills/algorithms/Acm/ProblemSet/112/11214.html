<h2>Guarding the Chessboard</h2>
</center>

<p>Given an <i>n</i>*<i>m</i> chessboard with some marked squares, your task is to place as 
few queens as possible to guard (attack or occupy) all marked squares. Below is a solution 
to an 8*8 board with every square marked. Note that queens can be placed on non-marked squares.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
The input consists of at most 15 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers 
<i>n</i>, <i>m</i> (1 < <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> < 10), the size of the chessboard. Next <i>n</i> lines 
each contain <i>m</i> characters, 'X' denotes marked square, '.' denotes unmarked squares. 
The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

<h2>Output</h2>
For each test case, print the case number and the minimal number of queens needed.
