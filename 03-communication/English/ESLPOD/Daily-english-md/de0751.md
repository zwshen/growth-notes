This episode is a dialogue between Arturo and Ling talking about “styles of music,” things people like in music.  Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Arturo:  What are you listening to?

Ling:  Some new music.  You want to hear it?

Arturo:  All right.  That’s pretty mellow, kinda bl uesy, isn’t it?  It’s got an interesting indie feel.

Ling:  Do you like it?

Arturo:  It’s all right.  I like more funky, dance music myself, but this is okay.  It’s not too depressing.

Ling:  That’s faint praise.

Arturo:  No, no, I do like it.  I guess I’m usually  in the mood for more up-tempo music, something with a driving beat.  I’m a hard-c ore MC-Quillan fan, if that’s any indication.

Ling:  Oh, I see, so you don’t really like acoustic  music much.

Arturo:  It’s just not my thing, you know?

Ling:  Yeah, that’s too bad.

Arturo:  Why?

Ling:  That was a track I recorded last week.

Arturo:  This is your music?  In that case, I love it.

Ling:  You’re just saying that.

Arturo:  No, really, it’s growing on me.  In fact, I want to hear more.  How about if I bring over some dinner on Saturday and you can pl ay me a few more tracks?

Ling:  You don’t mind?

Arturo:  Believe me, I’ll be all ears.

Arturo begins by saying, “What are you listening to ?”  Ling says, “Some new music.  You want to hear it?”  Notice she doesn’t s ay, “Do you want to hear it?” She’s speaking very informally.  Sometimes people d rop or eliminate the “do” in this kind of expression: “You want to eat?”  “Do yo u want to eat?”  Ling says, “You want to hear it (you want to hear my music)?”  Arturo says, “All right (okay).” He’s listening to it and he says, “That’s pretty me llow, kinda bluesy, isn’t it?” “Mellow” (mellow) means calm, quiet, very, we might  say, “tranquil.”  Something that is very peaceful is mellow.  Arturo says that Ling’s music is mellow, but also it’s kind of bluesy (bluesy).  “Bluesy” is an adjec tive that comes from “blues” (blues), which is a type of music formally called “ the blues.”  It’s a little sad sometimes; it’s often about things that are sad.  W hen someone says, “I’m feeling blue,” or, “I’ve got the blues,” they mean they’re feeling sad, they’re depressed.  So, blues music is often about things that are sad or depressing.  It was a style of music created in the early 20 th  century by African Americans here in the United States.

Arturo says that Ling’s music’s got an interesting indie feel.  “Indie” (indie) is a short form of “independent.”  “Independent” here re fers to a small record company, a company that makes CDs or MP3s and sells  them.  Usually, the word “indie” refers to a kind of music that is done  by lesser-known artists, singers who aren’t necessarily very famous, singing music that isn’t as popular as the kind of music you might hear on the radio.  So, “in die,” in referring to music, is that kind of music, but you could also have indie f ilms – movies, movies made

not with millions and millions of dollars, but with  a lot less money, less famous actors, but often about things that are perhaps mor e interesting than the movies you see in the movie theater.  So that’s “indie.”

Ling says, “Do you like it?”  Arturo says, “It’s al l right (it’s okay).  I like more funky, dance music myself.”  “Funky” (funky) means cool, h ip, interesting, unusual.  It’s a very broad adjective that could be used for lots of different things.  It was more popular, I think, in the 70s and 80s than it is now , but I guess you’ll still hear people talk about something being “funky,” someone my age perhaps.  “Dance music” is music that you would hear in a discothequ e; it usually has a very strong base line – a strong beat: bump bump bump bump bump  bump – that sort of thing.  And, I guess that’s easier for people to da nce to.  I’m not sure, I don’t go to discotheques, what we actually more commonly now  would just call “clubs.” I’m not a dance club kind of person, but for some p eople that’s what they like to do.  Of course when I was younger, well, you couldn ’t get me off the dance floor! The “dance floor” is the place where you dance, mea ning I loved to dance so much I was always dancing – dancing, dancing, danci ng, bump bump bump.

Anyway, back to reality.  Arturo says, “It’s not to o depressing,” describing Ling’s music, meaning it’s not too sad.  Ling says, “That’ s faint praise.”  “Faint (faint) praise” is when someone says something to you that sounds like a compliment but it really isn’t.  You are saying that, well, it ’s okay, but you’re really kind of criticizing the person.  So, when Arturo says that Ling’s music is not too depressing he’s making it sound like it’s a complim ent, but it’s really a criticism. That’s why Ling says, “That’s faint praise.”

Arturo says, “No, no, I do like it.”  He really is complimenting her, he says.  I’m thinking Arturo may be interested romantically in L ing, so of course he doesn’t want to insult her.  He says, “I do like it.  I gue ss I’m usually in the mood for more up-tempo music, something with a driving beat.”  “T o be in the mood for (something)” means to want to do something at a cer tain moment.  You may ask your husband or wife or friend, “What are you in the mood for for lunch today?” And they could say, “I’m in the mood for Japanese f ood.”  “I’m in the mood for French food,” or Korean or Chinese or whatever kind  of food you feel like – that you want to eat right now.  Well, Arturo is usually  in the mood for up-tempo music.  The “tempo” of the music is, roughly speaki ng, how fast it goes.  “Up- tempo” would be music that moves very fast, at a fa st rhythm or beat.  Arturo says he likes music with a driving beat.  A “drivin g beat” is similar to what I was talking about when I talked about dance music; it’s  something that has a very strong, repeating, usually fast beat – bump bump bu mp bump – the sort of thing you would hear in dance music, what used to be call ed “techno music” (techno),

that had that kind of driving beat.  It was a kind of song that you would – or music that you would dance to.  Is it still called techno  music?  I…I don’t know.

Arturo says, “I’m a hard-core MC-Quillan fan, if th at’s any indication.”  If you are “hard-core” about something you are very enthusiast ic about it, you are fully committed or dedicated to it, you are a big fan of something.  “I’m a hard-core Bruce Springsteen fan.”  I love Bruce Springsteen, I could listen to his music all day, I go to his concerts, I own all of his CDs and  records and all that sort of thing.  That’s to be “hard-core.”  In this case, Ar turo says he’s a hard-core MC- Quillan fan.  The “MC” is the person in charge of s ome ceremony or some event, but here it’s the person in charge of the music.  S o, “MC-Quillan” would be someone whose name was Quillan, but who was a “rapp er,” somebody who did a lot of rap music, kind of like me back 20 years a go, they called me MC-Quillan. I won’t actually rap for you however, and you shoul d be thankful for that!  Arturo says, “I’m a hard-core MC-Quillan fan, if that’s an y indication.”  We use that phrase, “if that’s any indication,” to show that we ’ve just given an example of the description or the explanation that we gave previou sly.

Ling says, “Oh, I see, so you don’t really like aco ustic music much.”  “Acoustic” (acoustic) is music that doesn’t have any electric guitars or electronic instruments.  It’s just, say, a guitar or a violin,  but not an electric guitar – a regular guitar, if you will.  Arturo says, “It’s just not m y thing, you know?”  When someone says, “it’s not my thing,” or, “it’s not his thing, ” in this case they mean it’s not something that you really like or enjoy.  The music  of Andrea Bocelli is not my thing.  He’s a very good singer, I’m sure.  Don’t g et mad, don’t send me emails saying you love Andrea Bocelli, I’m sure he’s a won derful singer.  He’s, of course, a famous Italian singer – popular singer, a s well as a classical singer. He’s just not my thing, okay?

Ling says, “Yeah, that’s too bad.”  Arturo says, “W hy?”  “That was a track I recorded last week,” Ling says.  A “track” is a son g on an album or a CD.  Arturo says, “This is your music?  In that case, I love it .”  Remember I said Arturo is interested romantically in Ling, I think.  Ling say s, “You’re just saying that,” meaning you don’t really believe what you are sayin g, that’s not really the truth. Arturo says, “No, really, it’s growing on me.”  Whe n we say something “grows on you” we mean you are starting to like it; you didn’ t like it in the beginning, but the more that you have it or experience it you like it more and more.  The music is growing on Arturo, he says, “In fact, I want to hea r more.  How about if I bring over some dinner on Saturday and you can play me a few more tracks?”  Ling says, “You don’t mind?” meaning that’s okay, that y ou would come over and listen to more of my music.  Arturo says, “Believe me, I’m all ears.”  The expression “all ears” means very eager or wanting very much to hear something

or to listen to someone.  Someone is saying, “I hav e a problem.  Can I ask your advice?”  You could say, “I’m all ears,” meaning ye s, I will listen to you completely and closely and carefully.  “Ears” has a  number of different other expressions that can be used with it, and other mea nings.  Take a look at our Learning Guide for some of them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
