In this episode, we’re going to talk about flying in an airplane that doesn’t cost very much money. There are some good things about that and, well, some not- so-good things. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anton: It’s amazing that we were able to get these airline tickets so cheaply.

Federica: It’s great, isn’t it? We can fly to Lawre nce City for a fun weekend. Let’s check in using this kiosk.

Anton: Hmm, this is asking me to pay $50 to bring a  piece of luggage aboard. I didn’t know there were such strict baggage restrict ions.

Federica: I didn’t realize it either.

Anton: And we have to pay another fee to reserve a seat. I didn’t know that the default was open seating.

Federica: Me, neither.

Anton: Did you know that we’re not flying directly to Lawrence City, but making two stops on the way?

Federica: Oh, no!

Anton: And there are other hidden fees for what the y consider add-ons, things we would normally get for free on other airlines, like  a soda, snack, blanket, and in- flight entertainment?

Federica: No, that’s news to me.

Anton: Here’s the kicker. We’re not flying into Law rence City Airport but to a remote airport 60 miles away. We’ll pay a lot for g round transportation to our hotel. Should we get a refund and forget about the trip?

Federica: Sorry, one thing I do know is that there are no refunds or changes allowed.

Anton: I should have known flying on a budget airli ne would be like this. It doesn’t seem like such a good deal now, does it?

Federica: No, this airline has turned nickel-and-di ming into an art form!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue is called “Flying on a Budget (budget)  Airline.” Something that is “budget” is something that is cheap. So, this is an  airline – a company that uses airplanes to fly you from one place to another – th at doesn’t cost very much money. Well, we find out in our dialogue that that isn’t always a good thing. Anton begins by saying, “It’s amazing that we were able to get these airline tickets so cheaply.” Federica says, “It’s great, isn’t it? We can fly to Lawrence City for a fun weekend.” I’m not sure where Lawrence City is exact ly, but it sounds like it’s a great place.

Federica says, “Let’s check in using this kiosk.” “ To check in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to report for your flight or reservati on – letting the company or someone know that you are ready to go or that you a re going to be using this particular service. If you fly, “checking in” usual ly can be done either on your computer 24 hours before you fly or at the airport.  It’s telling the airline that you are there and you are going to be taking this fligh t. Well, it doesn’t exactly say that you’re there if you check in online, but it sa ys you will be there and you will be going on the airplane.

You can also check in at a hotel if you have a rese rvation. You call the hotel and tell them you want a room. Then when you arrive at the hotel, you can check in. You can say, “Yes, I’m here. Please give me my key. ” A “kiosk” (kiosk) is a small

structure that could just provide information, but at an airport is used to check in. You are able to give the computer the information a bout your flight, and usually the kiosk machine can give you your boarding pass, which is a piece of paper you need to get onto the airplane.

Federica suggests to Anton that they check in using  the kiosk. Now, it is still possible in most American airports to check in talk ing to a real live human being rather than using a machine like a kiosk. Anton say s, “Hmm, this,” meaning the kiosk, “is asking me to pay $50 to bring a piece of  luggage aboard.”

A piece of luggage is something like a suitcase or a briefcase. “Aboard” means on the airplane with you. You can either take your luggage with you as you get on the airplane, or you can give it to the airline and they will put it down on the bottom of the airplane and then you pick it up agai n when you arrive. That’s called “checking your luggage.” Anton says that this particular airline is going to charge him $50 dollars to bring a piece of luggage aboard.

“I didn’t know there were such strict baggage restr ictions,” Anton says. “Baggage” (baggage) is another word for “luggage.” “Restrictions” are rules and limitations, usually, that prevent you from doing c ertain things. In this case, the baggage restrictions for the airline say that if yo u want to bring a piece of luggage aboard, you have to pay $50, which is an awful lot of money. Federica says, “I didn’t realize it either.”

Anton continues, “And we have to pay another fee” –  that is, more money – “to reserve a seat.” “To reserve” means to make arrange ments to do something in advance. “To reserve a seat on an airplane” means to select your seat so that when you get on the airplane, that seat is already yours – no one else can sit there. Anton says, “I didn’t know that the default was open seating.” The “default” (default) of something is the normal way that this works or the normal way that something happens.

In this case, the normal way that things happen on the airplane is “open seating.” Open seating is a system where there are no seats that are reserved, or we might also say “assigned (assigned) to someone.” Ev eryone just gets on the airplane and the first person who gets on gets to p ick the best seat, and so forth. No one has a reserved or assigned seat. Federica, a gain, didn’t realize this either.

Then Anton asks, “Did you know that we’re not flyin g directly to Lawrence City, but making two stops on the way?” “To fly directly”  somewhere means to go from one city to another without stopping at a third cit y to get there. For example, if

you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City, y ou can fly directly, meaning your plane will go up in the air in Los Angeles and  come down in New York City. You could also have what are called “stopovers,” or  simply “stops.” These would be places where you stop in between where you’re co ming from and where you want to end up.

So you might make a stop in Denver, or in Minneapol is, or in Detroit, or in a number of other cities in between Los Angeles and N ew York. “To fly directly,” then, means that you don’t make any stops. You don’ t have what are called “layovers” (layovers). Federica wasn’t aware of this either. She didn’t know they were going to be making two stops in order to get to Lawrence City.

Anton says, “And there are other hidden fees for wh at they consider add-ons.” A “hidden (hidden) fee” is money you have to pay that  you didn’t realize you had to pay, usually because the company doesn’t tell you d irectly. An “add-on” would be something additional or something that the company considers additional – things that are not included in, in this case, your  airline ticket.

Anton gives a list of some of these add-ons that he  and Federica will have to pay extra for – things that normally you get free on an  airplane such as soda, snacks, a blanket, and in-flight entertainment. “In-flight”  means while you are flying, while you are traveling. “In-flight entertainment” would be things such as TV shows, music, perhaps movies that the airline would in man y cases give you for free, although many U.S. airlines no longer do this. Fede rica was also ignorant of this. She says, “No, that’s news to me,” meaning “No, I d idn’t know that either.”

Then Anton says, “Here’s the kicker.” A “kicker” (k icker) is an unexpected piece of news, an unpleasant piece of information – somet hing that you didn’t expect. Anton says, “We’re not flying into Lawrence City Ai rport, but to a remote airport 60 miles away.” A “remote (remote) airport” would b e an airport that is at a great distance from the place where you plan on visiting.

“We’ll pay a lot for ground transportation to our h otel,” Anton says. “Ground transportation” refers to the way or the means of t ransportation you use to get from the airport to your, say, hotel. This could in clude taxis, buses, trams, shuttles, subways, and so forth – anything that goe s from the airport to where you want to go such as a hotel. Now that Anton know s about all these additional costs, he asks Federica, “Should we get a refund an d forget about the trip?”

A “refund” is when a company gives you your money b ack for something you’ve already paid for. Federica says, “Sorry, one thing I do know is that there are no refunds or changes allowed,” meaning the airline wi ll not give you your money

back if you cancel, if you decide not to go on your  trip. Anton says, “I should have known flying on a budget airline would be like this . It doesn’t seem like such a good deal now, does it?”

The expression “I should have known” means had I be en more intelligent, or had I thought about it more, I would have realized that  this was the case – that, in this case, budget airlines are not always a good deal, m eaning they’re not always cheap, because they have all these additional fees and expenses.

Federica says, “No, this airline has turned nickel- and-diming into an art form!” A “nickel” (nickel) in U.S. English refers to a five- cent coin – a coin worth five pennies, basically. A “dime” is a coin worth ten ce nts. The verb “to nickel-and- dime” means to charge people lots of little fees, s mall fees for all sorts of things. You don’t say, “Well, the price is this much and in cludes everything.” Instead, you give the person a low price, but then you charge th em for everything that the person may normally expect to be free.

This is what airlines do nowadays, at least in the U.S. It used to be that you got a free meal on an airplane when you flew from one cit y to another in the U.S. Nowadays, you have to pay for it. That’s an example  of what some people would consider nickel-and-diming you – to charge you for every little thing.

Frederica says the airline “has turned nickel-and-d iming into an art form.” “To turn it into” something means to make it into somet hing. An “art form” here refers to anything that requires creativity. Federica is j oking here. She doesn’t mean that the airline is actually doing something artist ic when it charges you for all of these small services and products. “To turn somethi ng into an art form” here means simply that the airline has become very creat ive in taking your money.

Now, let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a n ormal speed.
