[start of dialogue]

Andrea: This organizational chart is really confusi ng.

Raffael: Why are you looking at that?

Andrea: I have an interview next week and I’m tryin g to bone up on the company I’ll be interviewing with. I want to impress them, but this chart is really confusing.

Raffael: Let me see. It’s a simple flow chart. You have your board of directors at the top, with the managing director reporting to th em, and then the executive officers overseeing major departments.

Andrea: But I thought managers work below the execu tive officers.

Raffael: You’re confusing managers with managing di rectors. The managing director oversees the entire company, and managers oversee daily operations.

Andrea: Oh, I see. So these here are the department s: accounting, marketing, purchasing, personnel, R & D, sales, and production .

Raffael: That’s right. Which department are you int erviewing for?

Andrea: I think the job is in purchasing.

Raffael: You think? Don’t you think that’s somethin g you should get straight before you do anything else?

Andrea: You might have a point there.

Our dialogue begins with Andrea saying to Raffael, “This organizational chart is really confusing.” An “organizational chart” is a d iagram or an image that shows you the structure or organization of a company. Her e's the president, and then below the president there are two vice presidents, and then each vice president has an assistant vice president, and so forth. An “ organizational chart” is like a map of the company – who is the boss and how are th ey arranged, from the president down to the lowest worker.

Raffael says, “Why are you looking at that?” Why are you looking at this organizational chart? Andrea says, “I have an inter view next week and I'm trying to bone up on the company I'll be interviewing with .” So, Andrea is going to interview, I guess, with a new company, and she wan ts to “bone (bone) up.” “To bone up” is an informal, two-word phrasal verb mean ing to study, to study a lot – usually to try to memorize a lot of information in a short amount of time. Andrea is trying to bone up on the company with which she'll be interviewing.

She says, “I want to impress them,” – I want them to think that I'm good – “but this chart is really confusing.” She can't figure o ut how the company is organized. Raffael says, “Let me see” – let me look at that. H e says, “It's a simple flow chart.” A “flow (flow) chart (chart)” is actually a  diagram that shows how a process works. For example, you could do a flow cha rt on how to make a cake or bake a cake. First, you buy the ingredients, then y ou mix them together, then you put them in the oven. Then you take it out of the o ven. That could be made into a flow chart so you could see on a piece of paper how  one thing causes another thing, or you do one thing and then another thing.

“Flow charts” usually have boxes and circles with a rrows that connect the different steps of a process. Raffael says that this organizational chart is a flow chart, which is probably not correct. Raffael isn't  the brightest person in the world – not the smartest person in the world, let’s say. I don’t think the organizational chart is a flow chart. A flow chart is a chart that  shows you how a process works, but an organizational chart shows you how things are arranged: one on top of the other, or one higher up than the other.

But, we continue with Raffael's explanation. He say s, “You have your board of directors at the top, with the managing director re porting to them, and then the executive officers overseeing major departments.” W e have a lot of vocabulary there. Let's go back and look at that sentence. “Yo u have” – meaning here you have on the chart – “board of directors,” or “the b oard of directors.” A “board of

directors” is a group of people who make the most i mportant decisions for a company. Often, people on the board of directors do n't work for the company full- time. They might even be from another company.

Large corporations and companies in the U.S. typica lly have a board of directors. In fact, the government requires corporations in mo st places to have a board of directors. Sometimes, the board of directors can ju st be one or two people. Typically, it's 10 to 15 people if it's a big compa ny. The board of directors is at the top of the organizational chart. They’re sort of li ke the leaders of the whole company. Below them, at least on this organizationa l chart, we have the “managing director.” The managing director can also  be called the “CEO” – the Chief Executive Officer. This is the highest-level administrator in the company – sort of like the president of the company, although  he may not be called the president of the company.

“Below the managing director” – below the CEO, mean ing “below” in terms of power and authority – “come the executive officers. ” “Executive officers” are high- level members of a company that are usually in char ge of a certain section or part of the company. These executive officers overs ee major departments. “To oversee” (oversee), as a verb, means to supervise –  to make sure that employees are doing their work. These executive off icers are in charge of, or oversee, major or important departments. A “departm ent” is a section or part of a company.

Andrea says, “But I thought managers work below the  executive officers.” Raffael says, “You're confusing managers with managing dire ctors. The managing director oversees the entire” – or the complete – “ company, and managers oversee daily operations.” So, the managing directo r is in charge of the entire company. The managers are only overseeing daily ope rations, usually in just one small part of the company.

Andrea says, “Oh, I see,” meaning “I understand.” “ So these here” – pointing at the organizational chart – “are the departments.” T hen Andrea lists the departments in this company, the sections or parts of this company. They are accounting, marketing, purchasing, personnel, R & D , sales, and production. We have lots of terminology here. Let's start with the  first department, which is accounting. The “accounting” department is in charg e of keeping track of the money – how much money comes into the company and h ow much the company spends.

The “marketing” department is in charge of getting people to buy the product or service that the company makes. That could be adver tising. That could be doing

other promotions. There could be a lot of things in volved in marketing. The “marketing department” is usually the most importan t part of the company, in some ways – often the part of the company that gets  the most money because, of course, if the company doesn't sell anything, th en the company won't survive.

“Purchasing” is another part of this company. “Purc hasing” comes from the verb “to purchase” (purchase), which means to buy. This is the part of the company that buys the things that the company needs to make  whatever product it makes. Another department is “personnel” (personnel). “Per sonnel” is the department that is in charge of hiring people, of getting new people to come into the company. “Personnel” also takes care of other thing s related to the employees and their stay at the company.

“R & D” is another department mentioned by Andrea. “R & D” is “research and development.” The “R” and “D” stand for “research” and “development.” This is the part of the company that creates new products o r new services. “Sales” is the part of the company that actually goes out and sell s the product or service to the customer. The difference between “marketing” and “s ales” is that the marketing people are trying to get people to buy the product in a general way by advertising. The “sales department” are the actual people who go and talk to the customer – who perhaps collect the money, who give the product to the customer, and so forth. “Production” is the final d epartment mentioned by Andrea. “Production” is the part of the company tha t actually produces or makes the product.

Raffael asks Andrea, “Which department are you inte rviewing for?” – which of these departments are you trying to get a job with?  Andrea says, “I think the job is in purchasing.” Raffael says, “You think?” meani ng “You're not sure?” He says, “Don't you think that's something you should get st raight before you do anything else?” “To get straight” means to clarify, to under stand something that might be confusing. Raffael is saying that, obviously, Andre a needs to know what job she's applying for before she goes to the company.

Andrea says, “You might have a point there” – she a grees with Raffael. She says, “You might have a point there.” “To have a po int” means to have said something important, to have said something that is  worth paying attention to.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
