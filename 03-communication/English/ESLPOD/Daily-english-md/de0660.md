This episode is called “Work-Related Injuries.”  An  “injury” is when you hurt yourself.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Darrelle:  I just went to a seminar about work-rela ted injuries.  I really have to rethink my workspace.

Kim:  Work-related injuries?  It’s not like we’re d oing heavy lifting every day.  We sit at our desks all day.

Darrelle:  That’s the problem.  Look at how you’re slouching over your keyboard. Poor posture can cause a lot of problems over time.   Aren’t you always complaining about back pain?

Kim:  Yeah, but…

Darrelle:  And look at how you squint at your compu ter monitor all day.  Aren’t you always complaining about headaches?  You’re pro bably suffering from eye strain.

Kim:  It’s true that I sometimes have headaches.

Darrelle:  It’s no wonder.  Look at what we do all day, repetitive motion after repetitive motion.  Aren’t you suffering from elbow  pain right now?

Kim:  I was this morning…

Darrelle:  See what I mean?  We need better ergonom ics in this office.

Kim:  Okay, where do we start?

Darrelle:  I think we need to sign up for a seminar  on how to prevent work-related injuries.

Kim:  What do you have in mind?

Darrelle:  How about this four-day seminar?

Kim:  But that seminar is in Florida.

Darrelle:  What better way to recover from any work -related injuries than spending four days and three nights in Florida?

Kim:  Count me in!

Darrelle (or Darrelle – I guess either pronunciatio n is possible) says that he just went to a seminar about work-related injuries.  A “ seminar” (seminar) is the same as a workshop, or we might call it a conference.  U sually it’s one or two days, sometimes more.  Typically, seminars are meant to t each you something so it’s sort of like a class.  Almost every major professio n has seminars.  I used to give seminars – I used to do seminars for teachers, seve ral years ago, in talking about teaching reading to high school students.  Th at’s one of the things I did before starting ESL Podcast.

A “seminar,” then, is a class where you go to learn  something, and Darrelle learned about work-related injuries.  “Work-related ” means that it was somehow part of your job.  Well, in this case it wasn’t par t of your job; it’s something that happened when you were working or because you were working, something you did at work.  An “injury” is when you hurt yourself  physically, so “work-related injuries” would be things that would happen at work  that cause you pain, that cause you to hurt yourself.  Darrelle says, “I real ly have to rethink my workspace.”  “To rethink,” you should be able to gu ess, means to think again.  In English, that prefix “re” before a word typically m eans to do it again, to do it over and over again.  Darrelle needs to rethink his work space.  “Workspace” (one word) is the area where you work: your desk, your o ffice, and so forth.  This word has become popular in last few years; so has anothe r word called “workflow.”

“Workflow” is the order in which you do things: fir st I do A, then I do B, then I do C.

Darrelle needs to rethink his workspace.  Kim asks,  “Work-related injuries?” She’s confused; she doesn’t understand why Darrelle  is talking about this.  She says, “It’s not like we’re doing heavy lifting ever y day.”  Kim thinks of work-related injuries as being something that would happen if yo u were doing a lot of heavy lifting.  “To lift” something (lift) means to pick it up and raise it up high.  “Heavy” is, of course, the opposite of “light,” something that weighs a lot.  So, “heavy lifting” is when you are moving, for example, big b oxes of books or things that are very heavy and difficult that could cause you to, f or example, hurt your back or your legs or arms.  “Heavy lifting,” in general, is  often used to mean difficult work or a lot of work.  You could talk about a computer programmer who does the heavy lifting for a project.  He or she is the pers on that does most of the work. That’s another way of using this expression.

Kim says, “We sit at our desks all day.”  So, they’ re not doing physically difficult work.  Darrelle, however, says that that’s the prob lem.  “Look at how you’re slouching over your keyboard,” he says.  Because th ey sit at their desks all day they also have other injuries.  In Kim’s case, she’ s slouching over her keyboard. “To slouch” (slouch) means to sit or stand in such a way that your back, your shoulders, your neck sort of the curve forward slig htly.  They make you appear shorter than you actually are.  This is something y ou’ll see a lot with teenagers who are growing quickly; they don’t always do what we would refer to as standing up straight.  Sometimes a parent will say to their teenage son, “Stand up straight,” meaning don’t slouch, don’t lean over an d pretend you’re shorter than you are; stand up, put your head up, be as tall as you are.  That’s what the expression means; the opposite would be “to slouch. ”  “Poor posture,” Darrelle says, “can cause a lot of problems over time.”  “Po sture” (posture) is the way you hold your body in general, especially your what we would call “upper body,” from your waist to your head.  “Good posture” would mean  to sit up straight, not to slouch.  Darrelle says to Kim, “Aren’t you always c omplaining about back pain?” “Back,” here, refers to the part of your body in be tween your waist and your shoulders in, of course, the back of your body.  If  you have poor posture, if you are slouching all the time, that might cause some p ain in your back.  “Back” has many different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Kim says, “Yeah,” meaning yes, I do have back pain.   Darrelle says, “And look at how you squint at your computer monitor all day.”  “To squint” (squint) is when you partially close your eyes.  You don’t close the m all the way, but you’re trying to see something better; you’re trying to focus on something.  Or perhaps, there’s

a very strong light and you can’t open your eyes 10 0 percent – completely, so you close them a little bit.  We call that “squinti ng,” especially when you are trying to read something that is difficult to read: it’s t oo far away from you or it’s written in too small of a font – of a print.  Kim squints a ther computer monitor – her computer screen, and because of this she has headac hes.  These headaches, Darrelle thinks, are because she is suffering from eye strain.  “To suffer from” means that you have some pain caused by something.  “I suffer from a sore neck in the afternoons,” it hurts me.  “Eye strain” is w hen your eyes feel tired or they are bothering you, probably because you are trying to maybe read with poor lighting or you are looking at your computer screen  all day.  These things can cause problems with your eyes: eye strain.

Kim says, “It’s true that I sometimes have headache s.”  Darrelle says, “It’s no wonder,” meaning that’s not surprising; that is obv ious.  “It’s no wonder.  Look at what we do all day,” he says, “repetitive motion af ter repetitive motion.” “Repetitive” comes from “repeat,” to do something o ver and over again.  “Motion” is just another word for movement.  So, “repetitive  motion” is doing the same movements, often we associate this with your hands or arms, over and over again.  Darrelle says, “Aren’t you suffering from e lbow pain right now?”  Your “elbow” is what we call a “joint” (joint) that conn ects the two parts of your arm: the part between your shoulder and your elbow and the p art between your elbow and your hand, what we would call the “forearm.”  “Elbo w” has a couple of different meanings, believe it or not.  If you don’t believe me, take you look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Kim said that she was suffering from elbow pain in the morning.  Darrelle says, “See what I mean (which means do you understand now  what I am saying)?  We need better ergonomics in this office.”  “Ergonomic s” is technically the study of how we use our bodies when we are working.  It’s of ten used to talk about the way a chair is designed or the height of your desk versus your chair, doing things so that you don’t hurt yourself at work.  Kim says,  “Okay, where do we start (where do we begin)?”  Darrelle says, “I think we n eed to sign up for (to register for) a seminar on how to prevent work-related injur ies.”  “To prevent” means to stop something before it happens.  “I prevented my wife from yelling at me by bringing home 12 roses, 12 red roses, to show her that I love her and that I’m sorry I forgot yesterday was her birthday.”  I’m ki dding, of course.  I would not forget my wife’s birthday.  What kind of husband do  you think I am, huh?!

Well, Kim says to Darrelle, “What do you have in mi nd,” meaning what idea specifically do you have about going to a seminal.  Darrelle says, “How about this four-day seminar?”  Kim says, “But that seminar is in Florida.”  Florida is the state in the southeast corner of the United States.  It i s, especially in the southern part,

a place where people go on vacation because it is w armer than most of the rest of the U.S.  There’s also a Disney World in Florida , though that’s more in central Florida.  Darrelle says, “What better way to recove r from any work-related injuries than spending four days and three nights in Florida ?”  “To recover from” means to get better after being sick or to get stronger a fter an injury – after you hurt yourself.  Darrelle is saying that the best way for  he and Kim to recover from their injuries is to spend four days in Florida.  Kim agr ees with him; she says, “Count me in!”  “Count me in” is a phrase used to show tha t you want to participate in the same thing that someone else is participating in, o r you want to accept someone’s invitation to do something.  Somebody say s, “I’m thinking of going to a concert tonight.  Do you want to go?”  You could say, “Count me in!”  Yes, I’m very interested in going is what you’re saying.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
