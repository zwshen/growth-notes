This episode is called “Sharing With Others.”  It’s a dia logue between Benny and Julia with a lot of vocabulary related to sharing things with other people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Benny:  Mom says we’re supposed to share.

Julia:  I know.  I’m divvying up the candy right now.  Just  hold your horses.

Benny:  I want to do it.  I want to make sure I get my fair share.

Julia:  I called dibs on dividing up the candy, remember?   You snooze you lose.

Benny:  That’s not fair!  I wasn’t here when Mom came home.

Julia:  Bummer for you.  Okay, I’m done.  Here’s your sh are and here’s mine.

Benny:  Hey, the two piles aren’t equal.  You definite ly got the lion’s share.  You do that to me every time.  That’s not fair!

Julia:  What are you going to do about it?

Benny:  I’m going to tell!

Julia:  You’re such a baby.  Okay, if you don’t run to M om, I’ll let you call shotgun the next time we go anywhere in the car.

Benny:  You will?  You promise?

 Julia:  I cross my heart and hope to die.  Okay?

Benny:  All right, but I still want my fair share of t he candy.

Julia:  Okay, I’ve evened out the piles.  Satisfied?

Benny:  Yeah.  And can I do the divvying up next time?

Julia:  Don’t push your luck!

[end of dialogue]

Benny and Julia are clearly children in our dialogue.  B enny says to Julia, “Mom says we’re supposed to share.”  Of course he says that Mom says,  that gives him some authority.  “To share” means to let someone else hav e or use something that belongs to you, or part of something that belongs to you.

Julia says, “I know.  I’m divvying up the candy right now.  Just hold your horses.” “To divvy (divvy) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to divide something or group of something into two smaller groups or three sm aller groups – at least two.  You’re deciding how something is going to be sha red or distributed.  It could be money; here it’s candy.  You could also talk about divvyi ng up the work on a project: I’ll do this part, you do that part.  Julia te lls Benny to just hold his horses. “To hold your horses” is an informal phrase used to ask som eone to be more patient, to wait.  It’s sort of a thing that you would  say to perhaps a friend, a family member.  It’s also implying that you are being im patient.  If someone keeps asking you questions over and over again, and they don’ t stop, and you tell them, “Just hold your horses, will you?” you’re sayin g, in a way, stop bothering me so much, wait, I’ll tell you when I’m rea dy.  That’s the idea here.

Benny says, “I want to do it (meaning I want to divvy up t he candy).  I want to make sure I get my fair share.”  “To get your fair (fair ) share” means to get everything that you should receive, that you’re supposed to receive; to get what is, we would say, coming to you – that is, what belongs to  you or should belong to you.

Julia says, “I called dibs on dividing up the candy, rememb er?  You snooze you lose.”  “To call dibs” (dibs) is a very common phrase used especially by children. It means I get to use this thing, or I get to have thi s thing, and you cannot have it. For example, you are renting a hotel room with a fri end and there are two beds. You walk into the hotel room and you say, “I call dibs on the bed near the window.”  Notice the preposition “on,” which usually app ears after this phrase.

 Julia says, “I called dibs on dividing up the candy.”  “Divi ding” here is the same as “divvying up.”  To call dibs is something children do a lot.  For example, if you are driving in a car and there are several children, as w as the case when I was a child, if there were five or six, even seven of us going i n the car, someone would call dibs on the front seat.  They would say, “I get to g o to the front seat.”  This is typically done before the action is going to take place –  that is, before the event. Although mostly popular among children, this expression is still heard among adults today.  I’ve heard it; probably used it!

Julia says to Benny, “You snooze you lose,” you can also say “ if you snooze you lose.”  “To snooze” (snooze) means to fall asleep.  The i dea of “you snooze you lose” means that if you are late or if you wait too lon g you may miss the opportunity to do something or to get something.  So, if the children come home and there’s a cake or a pie sitting on the table and the children immediately go and cut themselves a piece, then another child comes five mi nutes later and there’s no more cake or pie left, one of the children m ay say to the person – to the kid who arrived late, “You snooze you lose.”  You wer e late therefore you missed the opportunity to do something, or in this case, t o eat something.

Julia was the first to call dibs on divvying up the candy, a nd now it’s too late for Benny to say that he wants to do it.  Benny says, “That’s n ot fair (that’s not right; that’s not reasonable)!”  “Fair” (fair) has a lot of d ifferent meanings, some of those can be found in our Learning Guide.  Benny says, “I  wasn’t here when Mom came home.”  In other words, when the candy arrived he wasn’t there to call dibs.  Julia says basically that’s too bad; she says, “Bumm er for you.”  A “bummer” (bummer) is a popular informal word used to show disappointment. It’s the same as “too bad,” but it’s a little more info rmal.  You still hear this expression, or this word quite a bit.  I don’t think it is as popular as it was maybe 20-25 years ago, but you will still hear it quite a bit .  “That’s a bummer,” you could say, or simply, “bummer.”

In this case, Julia says, “Bummer for you.  Okay, I’m done .  Here’s your share and here’s mine.”  Benny says, “Hey, the two piles aren’t  equal.”  A “pile” (pile) is a group of things, one on top of the other.  You coul d have a pile of clothing: you put a shirt and then on top of that you put some pan ts and then socks and then underwear and so forth.  That would be a pile of clot hing.  You could have a pile of newspapers, or a pile of papers on your desk.  This is a  pile of candy, but the piles are not equal.  “Pile” has a couple of other mea nings as well.  Once again, the Learning Guide will help you with those.  “To be  equal” means to be the same, and what Benny is saying is that his pile of candy is obviously not as big as Julia’s pile.  Then he also complains that Julia defin itely got the lion’s share. A “lion” is an animal; you’ve probably seen them on tele vision or in a zoo.  The

 “lion’s share,” however, means the larger part of someth ing, the majority, more than 50 percent.  Julia and Benny, in other words, did not split the candy equally – I should say Julia did not split it equally.  She gave herself the lion’s share – the biggest part.

Benny says, “You do that to me every time.  That’s not fai r!”  Julia says, “What are you going to do about it (how are you going to cha nge the situation)?”  Benny says, “I’m going to tell!”  “To tell,” in this dialogue , means to let someone know about something bad the other person has done.  This is typically – this meaning is typically one you would find among children.  If a lit tle child says, “I’m going to tell,” he means I’m going to tell on you; I’m going t o tell Mom or Dad that you did something wrong.

Julia says, “You’re such a baby.  Okay, if you don’t run to Mom (if you don’t go tell Mom what I did), I’ll let you call shotgun the n ext time we go anywhere in the car.”  “To call shotgun” (shotgun – one word) means to  say that you are going to ride in the front seat of the car – not the driver’s sea t, but the other seat, which we sometimes call the shotgun seat.  I’m not sure exactly why.  I guess if you were going hunting or going to kill someone, the perso n who wasn’t driving would be holding the gun.  That’s all I can think of.  In an y case, “to call” is the same here as “to call dibs on.”  “To call shotgun” means I get  to sit in the front of the car.  Again, it’s something that you would find especial ly among children, but adults could use this expression as well.  “To call” means I  get to do that, and the first person who calls shotgun is the person who gets to ride in the front seat.

Julia says that she will let Benny sit in the front seat n ext time.  Benny says, “You will?  You promise?”  Julia responds, “I cross my heart and  hope to die.”  “To cross your heart and hope to die” is a promise; it’s an in formal phrase, again often used by children to show that they are being hone st, that they really mean what they are saying.  “I cross my heart and hope to die, ” you’re saying you must believe me, I am telling you the truth.

Benny says, “All right, but I still want my fair share o f the candy.”  Julia says, “Okay, I’ve evened out the piles.”  “To even out” is a ph rasal verb meaning to make two things equal in size; in this case, the two piles of candy.  Then Julia says, “Satisfied?” meaning are you happy now, are you sati sfied Benny.  Benny says, “Yeah.  And can I do the divvying up next time?”  So  now he’s asking for something else; he wants to be the one to divide the can dy the next time there is candy.  Julia says, “Don’t push your luck!”  “To push your luck” is a phrase meaning to ask for too much, to ask for too many things es pecially after you have already asked for something.  So you go to your boss and yo u say, “Boss, I want a raise: a dollar an hour.”  The boss says, “Okay.”  And t hen you say, “I also want

 two more weeks of vacation.”  Your boss may say, “Don’t push  your luck,” meaning you’ve already asked for something, don’t keep aski ng for something else.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Benny:  Mom says we’re supposed to share.

Julia:  I know.  I’m divvying up the candy right now.  Just  hold your horses.

Benny:  I want to do it.  I want to make sure I get my fair share.

Julia:  I called dibs on dividing up the candy, remember?   You snooze you lose.

Benny:  That’s not fair!  I wasn’t here when Mom came home.

Julia:  Bummer for you.  Okay, I’m done.  Here’s your sh are and here’s mine.

Benny:  Hey, the two piles aren’t equal.  You definite ly got the lion’s share.  You do that to me every time.  That’s not fair!

Julia:  What are you going to do about it?

Benny:  I’m going to tell!

Benny:  You will?  You promise?

Benny:  Yeah.  And can I do the divvying up next time?

Julia:  Don’t push your luck!
