This episode is a dialogue about being successful r omantically with women – something I know nothing about. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jonah: I’d love to get a date with Jessica. She’s s o hot!

Becca: You mean you want to add another notch to yo ur bedpost.

Jonah: I’ve been around the block, but there’s noth ing wrong with sowing a few wild oats. That’s all part of being young and caref ree.

Becca: Hmm, maybe you shouldn’t be telling me about  your conquests.

Jonah: Why not? It’s no secret that I’ve got game. Chicks dig me. Last week alone I . . .

Becca: Really, I think I’ll take a pass on the play -by-play.

Jonah: See that woman over there? Watch me put the moves on her.

Becca: No, thanks. I’m leaving.

Jonah: Wait! Are you going to put in a good word for me with Jessica?

Becca: You know that she’s a good friend of mine, r ight?

Jonah: Of course I do. That’s why I’m asking you.

Becca: And you thought I’d set her up with a player ?

Jonah: I thought she might like a man with experien ce.

Becca: Forget it.

Jonah: In that case, what are you doing Saturday?

Our dialogue begins with Jonah saying to Becca, “I’ d love to get a date with Jessica.” A “date” is a romantic appointment – goin g to a movie or having dinner with someone you are romantically interested in. Jo nah thinks that Jessica is “hot,” meaning she’s attractive in a sexual way.

Becca says, “You mean you want to add another notch  to your bedpost? “To add a notch” (notch) to something is to make a mark, us ually in a piece of wood. The idea usually is that you are making the notch to ma rk or to count the number of times you’ve done something. If you are making a no tch in your “bedpost,” which is part of your bed, you are symbolically, if not a ctually, trying to count the number of romantic partners you’ve had.

Becca says that Jonah isn’t really interested in Je ssica as a person, but rather as a sexual object. Jonah says, “I’ve been around the block.” The expression – to say you’ve “been around the block” (block) – means you’ve had a lot of experience doing something.

Jonah says, “There’s nothing wrong with sowing a fe w wild oats” (oats). This expression “to sow (sow) wild oats” is actually a very old one, going back at least 500 years. It refers nowadays, in general, to a you ng man wasting his life doing things that aren’t very productive like drinking, a nd more specifically, having sexual experiences with different women. Depending on the context, it could be used to describe a young man who is wasting his lif e drinking and partying and, more specifically, on sexual adventures.

Jonah says, “That’s all part of being young and car efree.” “To be carefree” (carefree) means not to have any worries or concern s – to be free of cares, without any concerns. If you believe that “sowing a  few wild oats” means that you

will be carefree, you may be among the 50 percent of Americans who will at some point have a sexually transmitted disease in y our lifetime. So, congratulations. A “sexually transmitted disease” is a disease you get from having sex with someone else who has that disease. But Jonah believes he will be carefree.

Becca says, “Hmm, maybe you shouldn’t be telling me  about your conquests” (conquests). A “conquest” is a victory or success. In this case it refers to having sexual relations. Jonah says, “Why not? It’s no sec ret I’ve got game.” The expression “I’ve got game” is used to show that a p erson is very good at something. It is sometimes used especially among me n who think that they are very attractive to other women and are able to have  many romantic relationships with women, or to have those easily because women a re attracted to them.

In fact, that’s what Jonah says in the next sentenc e. He says, “Chicks dig me.” The word “chick” (chick) is an informal word for a female, especially a young female. It is considered somewhat of a sexist term.  You probably do not want to use it in your own conversation. It’s also somewhat  of an older term that isn’t as common now as it was maybe 30 years ago – similarly  with the expression “to dig” someone. “To dig” (dig) someone means that you  are attracted romantically to that person.

Jonah seems to think that women are attracted to hi m. That’s why he says, “Chicks dig me.” “Last week alone, I . . .” He begi ns to tell Becca something but Becca interrupts him. She says, “Really, I think I’ ll take a pass on the play-by- play.” “To take a pass (pass) on” something is to c hoose not to do something or not to receive something. Someone may offer you, I don’t know, a piece of pie, and you are trying to lose weight. So you say, “I t hink I’ll take a pass on the piece of pie, but thank you.” You are declining to have it. You are choosing not to have it.

Becca wants to “take a pass on the play-by-play.” “ Play-by-play” is a detailed description of what happens – or in this case, of w hat happened. “Play-by-play” is a phrase that comes from the world of sports, when you are watching or listening to a sporting event. The person who is announcing the game, who is talking about the game, will usually tell you exactly what is happening. This is especially true if you are listening on the radio. In order to  understand what is happening in the game, the person who is announcing the game giv es you the “play-by-play” – exactly what is happening at every moment in the ga me.

Jonah says, “See that woman over there? Watch me pu t the moves on her.” “To put the moves (moves) on” a person means to flirt w ith that person, to try to get

that person interested in you romantically. Becca s ays, “No, thanks. I’m leaving.” Jonah says, “Wait! are you going to put in a good w ord for me with Jessica?”

“To put in a good word” for someone is to recommend  someone to someone else or to say something good about someone. This is oft en used when someone is, say, applying for a job, or wanting to get a promot ion, or simply wants another person to like him. You may ask your friend “to put  in a good word for you” with a woman that he knows so that that woman will be inte rested in you. It probably won’t work, but you can try.

Becca says, “You know that she’s a good friend of m ine, right?” Becca is reminding Jonah that Jessica is one of her friends.  Jonah says, “Of course I do. That’s why I’m asking you.” Becca says, “And you th ought I’d set her up with a player?” “To set someone up” here means to arrange for someone to have a romantic date with another person.

When I first moved to Southern California, I had a student in one of my classes that I was teaching who I later became friends with , and she had a woman that she knew who was single, who was looking to date – who was looking to find a romantic partner. And so she set me up with her fri end. She got the two of us together and we went out and had dinner and went da ncing, I think. It wasn’t really a good match. She didn’t like me that much. I didn’t like her that much. So, things kind of ended. But my friend was nice enough  to “set me up on a date,” we might say, with this other woman. I think that’s the only time I’ve ever been set up on a date. Those kinds of arrangements are often ve ry successful. My mother and father met by being set up on a date by their f riends.

Becca doesn’t want to set up her friend Jessica on a date with Jonah because Jonah is a “player” (player). A “player” in this co ntext is a man who dates a lot of women, mostly because he wants to have sexual relat ions with them, not because he’s interested in them for any long-term r omantic relationship such as getting married. Jonah says, “I thought she might l ike a man with experience.” Becca says, however, “Forget it,” meaning she’s not  going to help him.

Jonah then says, “In that case, what are you doing Saturday?” Now Jonah is asking Becca for a date, and we don’t hear Becca’s response. We just hear the sound of the door slamming. “To slam” (slam) here r efers to a door that is being closed very loudly. The idea, of course, is that Be cca is saying no to Jonah by leaving. When a woman slams the door on you, you kn ow she’s probably not very happy – at least that’s my experience, anyway.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
