This episode is a dialogue between Mrs. Mason and C arl about taking care of a difficult child. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Mrs. Mason:  So, how did things go?

Carl:  Well...

Mrs. Mason:  What’s the matter?  Didn’t you and Jas on have a good time while I was away?

Carl:  It was interesting.  He was a little willful .

Mrs. Mason:  Yes, he can be a little strong-willed at times, but if you just do what he wants or give him what he wants, he’s just fine.

Carl:  He wanted to eat all of the cookies and I told him no.  He threw a tantrum.

Mrs. Mason:  A tantrum?  My son can be stubborn, bu t he never throws tantrums. What did he do exactly?

Carl:  Well, he threw his toys against the wall, ju mped the couch while shrieking at the top of his lungs, and he tried to bite my ha nd.

Mrs. Mason:  Oh, he was just expressing his displea sure, that’s all.  You don’t want children to bottle up their feelings.  You sho uld just have given him the cookies to pacify him.

Carl:  Really?  I didn’t want to spoil him, and eat ing all of those cookies wouldn’t be good for him.  He seemed to have too much energy  already, and he didn’t need another sugar rush.

Mrs. Mason:  Next time, you should just do what he wants.  He’ll grow out of this willful stage soon.

Carl:  Next time?

Mrs. Mason:  Yes, didn’t you say you could babysit Jason again on Saturday night?

Carl:  Oh, I’d made a mistake.  I have another comm itment on Saturday night.

Mrs. Mason:  That’s too bad.  We’ll call you the ne xt time we need a babysitter.

Carl:  Sure, I can’t wait.

Our dialogue begins with Mrs. Mason asking Carl, “H ow did things go?” “How did things g?” means “What happened?” You're usually re ferring to some specific event or situation that is now in the past, and you  want to find out whether things went well, whether the situation turned out to be a  good one or not.

Carl says, “Well…” Mrs. Mason says “What's the matt er?” – what's wrong – “Didn't you and Jason have a good time while I was away?” We learn that Carl is the babysitter. A “babysitter” is someone who looks  after your child, who takes care of your child while you go somewhere else. Nor mally, babysitters are women or high school girls. That's the sort of trad itional babysitter, but there are some boys and men, I guess, who babysit.

I babysat once. I babysat my two nieces, Corrie and  Molly, and that was many, many years ago. They were very young. One of them w as maybe, I don't know, three or four, and the other one was only, well, wa s still a baby, and it’s pretty much the worst experience of my life, I think. I th ink I can say that.

Anyway, Carl is a babysitter. He's taking care of M rs. Mason’s son, Jason. Carl says “It was interesting” – his experience with Jas on. “Jason,” he says, “was a little willful.” “To be willful (willful)” means to  be stubborn, not to do what you are supposed to do. Carl says that Jason was a little w illful. Mrs. Mason says, “Yes. He can be a little strong-willed at times.” “To be strong-willed” means the same

as to be willful, means to be stubborn, but it coul d also mean to have a lot of determination, a lot of persistence . So, it can be  a positive thing – strong-willed. “Willful” is almost always a negative thing.

Mrs. Mason says, “If you just do what he wants or g ive him what he wants, he's just fine.” Mrs. Mason is saying that if you give h er son everything he wants, he'll be fine, which of course, is true for all children.  If you always give them what they want, they’ll never cry, but then you'll have some really terrible children. So, you have to decide, right?

Carl says, “He wanted to eat all of the cookies and  I told him no.” Jason wanted to eat all of the cookies, the sweets. Carl said he  couldn't do that and so Jason “threw a tantrum.” “To throw a tantrum (tantrum)” m eans to behave very badly, very angrily. It's something that you would expect a small child to do. Mrs. Mason says that “A tantrum? My son can be stubborn,” that  is, willful, not willing to change his mind, not willing to compromise, “but he  never throws tantrums.”

So, Mrs. Mason asked Carl, “What did he do exactly? ” Carl says, “Well, he threw his toys against the wall.” He picked up his toys a nd threw them against the wall. “He jumped on the couch,” the sofa, “while shriekin g at the top of his lungs.” “To shriek” (shriek) means to yell very loudly, very lo udly. “At the top of your lungs” means very loudly. So, “to shriek at the top your l ungs” is a little redundant. It’s saying someone yelled very, very loudly. Some child ren are of course, capable of yelling very, very loudly. Not me. I was never a ch ild that would yell loudly. As the youngest child, I was always calm, always peaceful.  Well, unless you ask my mother. She'll probably tell you a different story.  Anyway, back to our story.

Carl says that Jason, in addition to shrieking, “tr ied to bite his hand.” “To bite” (bite) is to use your teeth to try to eat something , usually to take a piece of food off of a larger piece of food. Mrs. Mason says, “Oh , Jason was just expressing his displeasure. That's all.” “To express your disp leasure” means to indicate how you are not happy with the situation, to indicate h ow unhappy you are. Normally, this expression, “to express one's displeasure,” is  used when talking about adults who are showing their disagreement or their dislike  of the situation. It's not something we would use to describe a child.

What Mrs. Mason is doing, of course, is defending J ason, saying that he isn’t such a bad child. Mrs. Mason says, “You don't want children to bottle up their feelings.” “To bottle (bottle) up your feelings” me ans to hide your emotions, not to express what you’re really feeling.

For example, if you’re feeling sad but you don't te ll anyone that, and you instead act happy, in some ways you are bottling up your fe elings. Or if you are angry with someone and you don't express that, you don't show that, you hide those emotions, you could be described as “bottling up yo ur feelings.”

Now, bottling up your feelings is usually considere d a bad thing. However, as we know, to be an adult you have to hide your emotions  often, and you probably should in many cases. Some parents believe, however , that their children should be able to express whatever emotion they’re feeling  and that's just okay. My parents did not believe that, I can assure you. “Tr ust me,” we would say – believe me.

Mrs. Mason, however, believes it's not a good idea for her son to bottle up his feelings. She says to Carl, “You should have just g iven him the cookies to pacify him.” “To pacify” (pacify) means to calm down, to make someone feel more relaxed, especially somebody who's angry or upset. That's the meaning here anyway. “To pacify” is a verb that we would probabl y use once again, more often than not, for a child or children.

Carl says “Really? I didn't want to spoil him.” “To  spoil (spoil) someone” is to give a child everything he or she wants, so that the chi ld never learns any discipline, never learns that he or she has to accept a “no” so metimes in life. There are, of course, many parents who spoil their children, who give their children everything they want and then they grow up and they become my neighbor, and well, it's not a happy situation. But I moved recently so I'm actu ally talking about my old neighbor, not my new neighbors. My new neighbors are great…except for the dog that is always making noise. Otherwise, they're  wonderful! (Well, and their cars sometimes is in my way, but really, they're pr etty good.)

Carl thinks that Jason seem to have too much energy  and he didn't want to give him another cookie, so that he would have a “sugar rush.” A “sugar rush” is a temporary feeling of having a lot of energy that yo u get when you eat or drink something with a lot of sugar in it.

Mrs. Mason says, “Next time, you should just do wha t he wants. He will grow out of this willful stage soon.” “To grow out of someth ing” means to become older, to become more mature, to no longer do the sorts of bad things that you might have done when you were younger. Mrs. Mason thanks Jason  will grow out of this willful stage, this willful period in his developme nt as a child.

Carl says, “Next time?” Mrs. Mason says, “Yes. Didn 't you say you could babysit Jason again on Saturday night?” “To babysit,” we've  already defined, is to take

care of a young child, especially for his or her pa rent who isn't there. Carl says, “Oh, I've made a mistake. I have another commitment  on Saturday night.”

“To have another commitment” means you have another  appointment, another date, another situation where you have to go somewh ere, and in this case it means Carl won't be able to babysit Jason again. Mr s. Mason says, “That's too bad. We’ll call you next time we need a babysitter. ” Carl says, “Sure. I can't wait.” Of course, Carl doesn't really want to babysit Jaso n ever again, but he's being polite when he says “he can't wait.” Normally that' s an expression you say when you're looking forward to something, but Carl is de finitely not looking forward to babysitting Jason again.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
