[start of dialogue] 

Heidi: You look very relaxed reading magazines in t he middle of the workday. 

Tim: It’s my job. I’m tasked with spotting new tren ds. 

Heidi: And you do that by reading magazines with yo ur feet up? 

Tim: Why not? I also frequent places where hipsters  hang out, listening to their conversations and observing what they’re wearing, e ating, drinking, and doing.  

Heidi: That doesn’t sound too onerous. 

Tim: It’s all about finding the trendsetters, the p eople who are beta testers and early adopters. These are also the bellwethers for when a trend has run its course. 

Heidi: Can’t you just see what people are buying? 

Tim: By then, it’s too late. Those are people who a re jumping on the bandwagon, not the movers and shakers. 

Heidi: Well, don’t look at me. I lag behind every t rend and don’t have any idea what’s in or out. 

Tim: Luckily, you have me to tell you. I’ve been me aning to talk to you about your choice of footwear . . .

 Heidi begins our dialogue by saying to Tim, “You lo ok very relaxed reading magazines in the middle of the workday.” Heidi is s aying to Tim that he seems very relaxed, very calm, but you can kind of guess that she’s wondering why Tim is reading a magazine instead of working. That’s wh y she says “in the middle of the workday.” The “workday” is a day that you would  normally expect to work. For most of us, that’s Monday through Friday.  

Tim says, however, “It’s my job” – in other words, reading magazines is his work. He says, “I’m tasked with spotting new trends.” A c ouple of interesting words and phrases there. Let’s start with the verb “to be tas ked (tasked) with” something. “To be tasked with” something is a phrasal verb mea ning to be given the job to do something or, more generally, to be responsible for something, for doing something. You could say, “I’m tasked with getting milk at the store,” meaning someone told you (probably your wife) to get some m ore milk at the store – or cheese, or butter, or meat, or chicken, or whatever .  

The verb “to spot” (spot) means to identify somethi ng, especially something that might be difficult to see or to find. A “trend” (tr end) is something that has become popular recently. We often talk about “trends” on t he Internet – things that people are doing now. This is especially popular with youn g people. Trends in fashion, trends in music – what’s popular now or what has be en popular recently. Those are all trends.  

Heidi says, “And you do that,” meaning you spot new  trends, “by reading magazines with your feet up?” “With your feet up” m eans just what it says. You are putting your feet up on a chair or on your desk  as a way of relaxing. Some people like to put their feet up when they relax. I n general, the expression “to put your feet up” means to relax, be calm, not work too  hard. Heidi is saying that Tim doesn’t look like he’s working very hard.  

Tim says, however, “Why not?” meaning “Why not put my feet up?” “I also frequent places where hipsters hang out, listening to their conversations and observing what they’re wearing, eating, drinking, a nd doing.” Tim then gives us some other things he does to spot new trends. He fr equents places. “To frequent” (frequent) as a verb means to go somewher e often or regularly, especially as a customer. “I frequent my local Star bucks.” That means I go there often as a customer.  

Tim says he frequents “places where hipsters hang o ut.” A “hipster” (hipster) is usually a young person who follows all the latest t rends, all the latest fashions, especially when we’re talking about clothing or foo d or even ideas. Here in Los  

Angeles, we have lots of young hipsters – people wh o listen to the most popular music or eat at the most popular restaurants and th ink in general that they’re pretty cool. That’s a hipster.  

Tim is going to “places where hipsters hang out.” “ To hang (hang) out” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to spend time with others , or at a certain place having fun, but not really doing anything serious –  certainly not working. Tim, then, frequents places where hipsters hang out and observes what they’re doing, what they’re wearing, what they’re drinking, and so  forth. Heidi says, “That doesn’t sound too onerous” (onerous). “Onerous” is an adjective meaning difficult or challenging.  

Tim says, “It’s all about finding the trendsetters,  the people who are beta testers and early adopters.” A “trendsetter” is a person wh o starts trends or who has a lot of influence on other people around him. If you are  a “trendsetter,” you are one of the first people to wear a certain kind of clothing  or eat a certain kind of food – that would be a trendsetter, someone who’s influent ial. We also might call this person an “influencer,” although that has a broader  meaning.  

Tim also uses the word “beta (beta) tester (tester) .” Technically, a beta tester is someone who tries new types of software before the software is ready for everyone else to try. That’s a beta tester. Sometim es when a company starts a new product – “launches,” we would say, a new kind of software – it will ask people to be beta testers, to test it and find any problems in the software. Here I think Tim is using this term more generally to mean  people who are the first to try some new things, some new trend.  

A “early adopter” (adopter) is a person who buys a new product right after it is available for purchase. An early adopter is a perso n who goes out and buys the newest iPhone or the newest computer as soon as it is made available for purchase, as soon as you can go and buy it. The ear ly adopter “adopts,” or starts using, that new technology right away. You can see there is a relationship here between “trendsetter,” “beta tester,” and “early ad opter.” All three terms relate to someone who does something before the general publi c does it.  

Tim says, “These,” meaning, these people, “are also  the bellwethers for when a trend has run its course.” A “bellwether” (bellweth er) is a person or group or thing that indicates how something is changing or that pr edicts the future in some way. We might consider the word “bellwether” very simila r to the word “predictor” – an indication of how things will turn out in the futur e. For example, college campuses and universities are often bellwethers of larger so cial change. The change starts at the university and then becomes more popular in other parts of society.   

 A “bellwether,” then, would be a person in this cas e who will indicate that there is some major or larger change that will take place in  the future. If you’re a trendsetter – if you’re a person who is influential  – when you change, that means that the rest of the world will change sometime in the future. So, looking at you can help us predict how things will change with oth er people in the future. The expression “to run its course” (course) means to en d – to no longer be popular, in this case. When a trend has run its course, it is n o longer popular. It is no longer something that people are doing.  

Heidi says, “Can’t you just see what people are buy ing?” She’s wondering why Tim has to do all this research. Tim says, “By then ,” meaning by the time people buy things, “it’s too late.” “Those are people who are jumping on the bandwagon, not the movers and shakers.” Tim is saying that it’ s too late to wait and see what becomes popular in terms of the general public, the  average person. You have to be able to see what will be popular in the near fut ure.  

He describes people who are not trendsetters as peo ple who are “jumping on the bandwagon” (bandwagon). “To jump on the bandwagon” means to join something or to support something that is already p opular. You’re not one of the first people to join it or to do it – you wait unti l everybody else starts doing it and then you start doing it. That’s “jumping on the ban dwagon.” A “mover and shaker” is a person who is influential and powerful, especi ally someone in the business world. If you say someone is a mover and a shaker, you’re saying this person has a lot of power, has a lot of influence, in some  particular area.  

Heidi says, “Well, don’t look at me,” meaning don’t  observe me for these trends. “I lag behind every trend.” “To lag (lag) behind” m eans to move more slowly than other people, to progress more slowly than everyone  else. If someone is “lagging behind,” they are behind or less advanced than ever yone around them. What Heidi is saying is that she doesn’t follow the late st trends. She lags behind. She will do something only after everyone else has alre ady done it.  

She says she has no idea “what’s in or out.” “In” w ould be something that is popular or cool. “Out” would be something that is n ot popular or not cool. Tim says, “Luckily, you have me to tell you,” meaning f ortunately for you, I am doing that work, so I can tell you what’s in and out – wh at’s popular and not. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you about your choice of footwea r.” “I’ve been meaning to talk to you” here means this is something that I have be en wanting to tell you.  

Tim wants to say something to Heidi about her footw ear. “Footwear” (footwear) is what you wear on your feet. It refers to the kinds of shoes that you wear. We get  

the idea that Tim is about to tell Heidi that her s hoes are no longer fashionable, or the style of her shoes is no longer “in,” but ra ther, “out.” That would probably describe everything that I wear. I’m definitely not  a trendsetter. In fact, I just discovered this new rock band that you might have h eard of already called the Beatles. Yeah. They’re really good. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
