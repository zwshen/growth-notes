This episode is a dialogue between a father and his  daughter about a pet that has died.

[start of dialogue]

Dad: Honey, I have some bad news for you. Fluffy ha s gone to the other side.

Sarah: You mean she’s out of her cage again? I’ll g o and try to find her.

Dad: No, you don’t understand. Fluffy passed away in the night.

Sarah: Oh, she died! That’s too bad, but she was ge tting up there in years.

Dad: Yes, but she didn’t die a natural death. She w as run over by the neighbor’s car.

Sarah: You mean she was flattened? Cool!

Dad: Well, I wouldn’t put it that way, but I unders tand if you’re in shock. I guess people show grief in different ways . . .

Sarah: Fluffy went out with a bang. That’s the way she would have wanted to go.

Dad: I’d like to think of her as being in heaven an d she’s gone to meet her maker.

Sarah: I don’t think there’s an afterlife for anima ls, Dad. It’s all just a part of the circle of life.

Dad: Okay. I thought we could have a funeral for he r so we can pay our respects.

Sarah: Is that really necessary?

Dad: I’d thought you’d want one. She was your pet, after all.

Sarah: No, let’s just bury her in the backyard.

Dad: And who said that the youth of today is cynica l?

This episode is all about one’s “pet” (pet) dying. A pet is an animal that you have usually in your house or near your house. A pet is typically something like a dog or a cat that people like to have. It’s sort of a c ompanion – a friend, if you will. I don’t know. I don’t have any pets. I don’t really l ike animals, but if you’ve been listening to ESL Podcast, you probably know that al ready. Let’s get into our dialogue, then.

We have a father talking to his daughter, Sarah. He  says, “Honey, I have some bad news for you.” “Honey” (honey) is a word we use  for a girl or a woman. It’s what we would call a “term of endearment.” It’s sor t of a nice thing to say to someone. A man may call his wife “honey,” or girlfr iend “honey.” It’s a term of affection used for a woman or a girl. Certainly it’ s something that a father could use with his daughter, and that’s what we see here.

Dad says, “I have some bad news for you. Fluffy has  gone to the other side.” “Fluffy” was either a dog or a cat, I’m not sure wh ich. Let’s call it a cat. I think that’s probably a more likely match, or fit, for the name Fluffy. “Fluffy,” Dad says, “has gone to the other side.” “Gone to the other si de” is just a nice way of saying that someone has died, that someone – or in this ca se, some animal – is no longer living.

Sarah, however, doesn’t really understand her fathe r because “to go to the other side” could mean simply to go, say, from your prope rty to the property next to you – from your house to somewhere else. So she says, “ You mean she’s out of her cage again?” A “cage” (cage) is something that you would keep an animal in. So maybe this isn’t a cat; maybe this is a rabbit or s omething. Anyway, it doesn’t matter. Sarah says, “I’ll go and try to find her.”

 Sarah thinks that the animal has escaped from its c age, from the place where she was keeping it. Her father says, “No, you don’t  understand. Fluffy passed away in the night.” The phrasal verb “to pass away”  also means “to die.” It’s much more common to hear someone describe someone d ying as the person “passing away” than it is “going to the other side. ” In fact, I don’t think you would hear the expression “to go to the other side” very often.

People often, however, do say that someone has “pas sed away.” It’s a nicer way of saying someone has died. There are lots of “euph emisms” – nice ways of describing death and the process of dying. In some Christian churches they use the expression “fallen asleep in the Lord,” which I  kind of like – the idea of falling asleep. It sounds a bit more poetic.

Sarah says, “Oh, she died! That’s too bad, but she was getting up there in years.” The expression “to get up there in years” means to be old – to no longer be young or even middle-aged. Sarah doesn’t seem too u pset – at least, not as upset as her father perhaps thought she would be. D ad says, “Yes, but she didn’t die a natural death.” A “natural (natural) death” is when you die of some disease or illness or failure of some bodily organ or part,  such as your heart or your lungs.

If it’s not a natural death, then it’s either an ac cident or it’s murder. No, I don’t think Fluffy has been murdered, but that would be r eally interesting in terms of the story. You know what I’m saying? Then I could b e like a detective – the person who tries to find out who murdered, in this case, Fluffy. But no, it wasn’t a murder. It was, however, an accident. Dad says, “Sh e was run over by the neighbor’s car.” “To be run over” means to be hit a nd injured or, in this case, killed by a car that goes over, in this case, the a nimal.

We’re not sure if it was an accident, however. Reme mber, it was the neighbor who was driving the car. Maybe the neighbor was try ing to kill Fluffy. It’s possible. But we continue. Sarah says, “You mean she was flat tened? Cool!” “To flatten” (flatten) something is to make it flat, meaning to make it so that it has very little height. Usually we flatten something with a heavy w eight or object.

But Sarah thinks it’s cool. Sarah thinks it’s kind of interesting, in a good way, that the pet was flattened by the neighbor’s car. Maybe Sarah shouldn’t be owning pets. Anyway, Dad says, “Well, I wouldn’t put it th at way,” meaning I wouldn’t say that, “but I understand you’re in shock.” “To be in  shock” (shock) is to be very surprised by something, usually something negative.

Dad continues, “I guess people show grief in differ ent ways.” “Grief” (grief) are feelings of extreme sadness after someone has died.  Sarah says, “Fluffy went out with a bang.” “To go out with a bang” (bang) is  to die doing something exciting, unusual, surprising, and/or memorable in some way. I really don’t care about going out with a bang. I’d rather just not go  out – that is, die. But we all have to, don’t we? Sarah says, “That’s the way she would have wanted to go,” meaning that’s the way Fluffy would have wanted to die – assuming animals could want something in the same way that we want s omething.

Dad says, “I’d like to think of her” – I’d like to imagine her – “as being in heaven and she’s gone to meet her maker.” “Heaven” (heaven ) in many religions is a place where God lives, where you go after you die o r where you may go after you die. According to the theologians in the rock group  the Bangles, “Heaven Is A Place on Earth,” but I don’t think many people beli eve that. The expression “gone to meet your maker” (maker) means that you have die d. It’s another way of saying someone has died and has gone on to meet God . God here being the maker of the world and of all things.

Sarah says, “I don’t think there’s an afterlife for  animals, Dad.” An “afterlife” (afterlife) is a state that your soul is in after it dies. It’s the idea that you have a soul or spirit that continues living on, or it coul d simply refer to whatever happens to you after you die, whatever continued existence you have. Sarah says, “It’s all just part of the circle of life.” The phrase “circl e of life” is sometimes used to talk about the natural processes of birth, life, and dea th.

Dad says, “Okay, I thought we could have a funeral for her so we can pay our respects.” A “funeral” (funeral) is a ceremony that  you hold after someone dies, often intended to honor the person who has died – to give friends and family a chance to talk about the person, perhaps, or rememb er the person. “To pay your respects” (respects) – notice it’s plural – means to honor someone’s memory or to remember someone in a nice way by actually going  to his or her funeral.

Sarah says, “Is that really necessary?” Dad says, “ I thought you’d want one,” meaning I thought you would want a funeral for Fluf fy. Dad says, “She was your pet, after all.” But Sarah says, “No, let’s just bu ry her in the backyard.” “To bury” (bury) is to put a dead body into a hole in the gro und and cover it with dirt. Usually you put the body in some other container, s ome sort of box, which for a human body we would call a “coffin” (coffin).

Dad is a bit surprised by Sarah’s attitude. He says , “And who said that the youth of today” – that is, young people today – “is cynic al” (cynical). “Cynical” in this case means not interested in commonly accepted stan dards and behaviors. It

can also be used to describe someone who is self-in terested, who is looking after his own interests before other people.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
