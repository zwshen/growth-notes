Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 159: Moonlighting. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 159. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. 

On this podcast, we’re going to hear about someone who works two jobs – someone who moonlights. Let’s get started! 

[start of dialog] 

Robert: You look exhausted. You must have been out late last night having fun. 

Muriel: I wish. I’ve actually started moonlighting.  I’ve decided to go back to school and need the extra money to make ends meet.  

Robert: Good for you. That’s great. Where are you m oonlighting?  

Muriel: I’m working at the university library. At t hat time of night, it’s pretty dead. When there are no students around, I can use the ti me to study. It works out pretty well, except for the hours. 

Robert: Oh, yeah? What are they? 

Muriel: My work schedule is pretty good, actually. I work three days a week: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. But my hours are 7 t o midnight. By the time I get home, I’m dead tired.  

Robert: No wonder you look beat. Here, have some mo re coffee.  

Muriel: Thanks. I just hope I don’t fall asleep in the morning meeting. 

Robert: It’s okay. No one will notice. 

Muriel: Thanks a lot!  

Robert: Don’t mention it.

 The title of today’s podcast is “Moonlighting,” and  “to moonlight” (moonlight) – all one word – means to work a second job, usually at n ight, in addition to your regular job. So, you have two jobs, or perhaps thre e jobs. “Moonlight,” of course is what comes from the moon up in the sky which you  can see at night, and because people usually work their second job, if th ey have a second job, at night, they work “by the moonlight,” meaning that they can  see the moon when you’re working – I guess – if you’re working outdoors. But  “moonlighting,” just means, in general, to work another job, a second job. My fath er, for example, worked two jobs. He moonlighted. During the day, he worked as a teacher and at night he worked at the post office because he had such a big  family and lots of people to feed – to give food to. 

Anyway, in this particular dialog, Robert and Murie l are talking and Robert says, “You look exhausted.” “To look exhausted” or “to be  exhausted” – and “exhausted” is (exhausted) – “to look exhausted” me ans to look very tired, to look very, very tired. The verb “to exhaust” actually ha s two meanings. If we talk about a person, we say, for example, “This person exhaust s me” – means they make me very tired. If you use the verb “exhaust” with a  thing, for example, “I have exhausted my money,” or “I have exhausted my time,”  that means that I have used it all up – that I have used it and I don’t ha ve any more left. Well, in this case, Robert says, “You look exhausted” – you look very tired. “You must have been out late last night having fun.” “You must hav e been” – means you probably were. I think that you were, in this case. “To be o ut late” means, in general, to have gone somewhere – to a movie, to dinner, perhap s dancing. “To be up late” means you did not get home until very late at night . “I was out late last night” usually means I was out with friends having a good time. 

Well, Muriel says, “I wish.” This is a pretty commo n expression, informally. When someone says, “Oh, I wish” with that sort of accent , that sort of intonation, they mean that they did not, in fact, do what you said t hey did. But they wish that they had. Usually, it’s something positive that they wis h they had done. So, in this case, when Robert says, “You must have been out lat e last night having fun,” Muriel says, “I wish,” meaning I wish I had been. I t’s a use of the conditional. But instead of saying, “I wish I had been out having fu n,” she says just, “I wish.” Well, she says that in fact, she has started moonlighting  because she is going back to school – probably back to college, back to the univ ersity. And she needs the extra money “to make ends meet.” “To make ends (end s) meet (meet)” – two words – “to make ends meet” means to get money to p ay for your basic living expenses – your food, your rent, your transportatio n, your car. “To make ends meet” means to have enough money to live at a very simple level. Robert says, “Good for you.” That again, is a common expression that we use, in this case,  

when a person is complimenting you, is saying a nic e thing about you – usually something that you are trying to do to improve your self or to do something good for someone or for yourself. So, the expression her e, “Well, good for you” means that’s great. I think that’s wonderful. Usually, we  use that among friends.  

Well, Robert says, “Why” – or rather, “Where are yo u moonlighting?” And Muriel says, “I’m working at the university library” – the  college library. “At that time of night, it’s pretty dead.” “At that time of night” m eans when she has to work – later at night – it’s pretty dead. When we say something is “dead” (dead) we mean there is not much going on. There are very few peop le there. So, if you go to a store, and you say, “Wow. It’s really dead here.” W e mean there’s no one here. And in this case, Muriel is saying that there aren’ t very many people at the library. It’s pretty dead. “When there are no stude nts around,” she says, “I can use the time to study.” “When there are no students  around (around)” means when there are no students present – when there are  no students there. You, again, can use this expression in lots of ways. “I went to my brother’s house, but there was no one around” – means there was no one t here – no one present. Muriel says that “It works out pretty well, except for the hours” – that is, her job works out pretty well. For something to “work out” means that it is going well, it has a good result. It is something that is positive . “Is this going to work out?” means is this going to function. Is this going to h ave a good result? She says, “It works out pretty well,” and again, of course, we us e “pretty” (pretty) to mean very. So when Muriel says, “It’s pretty dead” she means i t’s very dead. “It works out pretty well” means it works out very well, except f or the hours. “Except for” here means everything is good but this thing is not – in  this case, the hours. And when she says, “The hours” she means the hours she has t o work.  

Robert asks her, “Oh, yeah? What are they?” meaning  what hours do you work. And she says, “My work schedule is pretty good. I w ork three days a week – Monday, Wednesday and Friday – but my hours are 7 t o midnight.” 7 P.M at night to midnight – those are the hours she has to work – “my hours,” she says. By the time she gets home, she says she is “dead ti red.” Here, the word “dead” means something a little bit different. When we say  we are “dead tired.” We mean that we are very tired. We are exhausted. Some one says, “Oh, I’m dead tired” – they mean they’re very tired. Robert says,  “No wonder you look beat.” “No wonder” means here that it is no surprise that you look that way. And again, that’s a common use of that expression. “No wonder you’re such an idiot. Your parents are idiots.” Well, that’s not a very nice t hing to say. “No wonder” means it is no surprise, it is clear. Usually, we use that e xpression when we are going to give the reason why something is happening. For exa mple, someone comes in and they are very wet – their clothes are wet, thei r hair is wet and you may say,  

“No wonder you are wet. It’s raining outside.” So, it’s no surprise that you are wet. 

Well, Robert says here, “No wonder you look beat.” “To look beat” (beat) is the same as “to look exhausted” – someone who is very, very tired. You may say, “Oh, I am beat” – means I’m very exhausted. Now, as  a verb, “to beat” means something different. It does not mean the same as “ to exhaust.” When you say “I’m going to beat something,” it has couple of mea nings. It can mean I’m going to win over someone else. The Los Angeles Lakers be at the New York Knicks. The Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Minnesota Twins – the sports teams defeat someone else – that can mean “to beat.” “To beat” c an also mean to hit. “The man beat his horse because it didn’t ride fast enou gh.” I don’t know. That is a use of “to beat,” but here, as an adjective it means “v ery tired.”  

Muriel says that she hopes she does not fall asleep  in the morning meeting. And Robert says, “It’s okay. No one will notice.” “To n otice” (notice) means no one will realize. No one will know what is happening. Of cou rse, Robert is joking when he says no one will notice because what that means is that Muriel is obviously not very important and he’s kidding, he’s joking. And t hat’s why Muriel says, “Thanks a lot!” meaning you’ve insulted me, but she knows i t is a joke. And Robert says, “Don’t mention it.” When someone thanks you, you ca n say, “You’re welcome.” But you can also say, “Don’t mention it.” “Mention”  is (mention) – “Don’t mention it.” You use that expression especially when you do  someone a favor. You help someone with something and they thank you and you s ay, “Ah, don’t mention it. It was nothing.” You can also say, “No problem.” Th at’s another way people respond to thank you. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
