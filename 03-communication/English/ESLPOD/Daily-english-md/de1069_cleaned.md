This episode is a dialogue between Vince and Alana about what happens with a child, one of your children, who does something tha t makes you angry. We’ll find out what Vince’s solution is in a moment. Let’s get  started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Vince: That’s it! I’ve had it with Daniel defying m e at every turn. I want him to follow in my footsteps and study law, but he wants to be an artist. He dates girls I don’t approve of. But this! This is beyond the boun ds of what I’ll tolerate. 

Alana: I know you’re upset, but don’t do anything r ash. I’m sure Daniel didn’t mean what he said.  

Vince: Oh, he meant it. That’s it! I’m disowning an d disinheriting him.  

Alana: I’m sure you don’t mean that. You both spoke  in anger. I’m sure a cooling- off period of a few days will change his mind. 

Vince: It’ll be too late. I’m cutting him out of my  will tomorrow. I have other descendants who’ll appreciate inheriting my money a nd property. 

Alana: But Daniel is your rightful heir. He’s your only child.  

Vince: Then he should have known how his hateful wo rds would hurt me.  

Alana: What did he say exactly? 

Vince: He said he has become a San Francisco Giants  fan. A Giants fan!  

Alana: That’s it?  

 Vince: That’s it?! He’s wounded me to the core! 

[end of dialogue] 

Vince begins by saying to Alana, “That’s it!” When someone says, “That’s it!” they mean this is the final action that I’m going to put  up with or tolerate. We say it when we’re angry and frustrated. Vince is angry and  frustrated. He says, “I’ve had it with Daniel defying me at every turn.” When we say we’ve “had it” with someone or something, we mean that we are tired of it. We are frustrated by something. We no longer will tolerate it or put up with it.  

Vince is tired of Daniel defying him at every turn.  “To defy” (defy) someone means to refuse to obey someone, to say no when som eone tells you to do something. That’s what Daniel is doing. He’s defyin g Vince at every turn. The expression “at every turn” means frequently, repeat edly – every time the possibility arises, every time the situation arises . Daniel is taking the opportunity of saying no to Vince.  

Vince says, “I want him to follow in my footsteps a nd study law, but he wants to be an artist.” “To follow in someone’s footsteps” ( footsteps) means to do what another person has done, especially the same kind o f job or profession that another person has. So, for example, if your father  was a teacher and you decide to become a teacher, we might say that you have fol lowed in your father’s footsteps.  

My father was a teacher. I became a teacher. So I, in fact, followed in my father’s footsteps. Your “footsteps” literally are the place s where you put your foot down on the ground. If you walk in an area that has very  soft dirt or mud, you will leave “footprints,” just like your fingers leave fingerpr ints when you touch something. Footprints come from your footsteps – the places wh ere your foot touches the ground.  

Vince wants Daniel to become a lawyer – to study la w – but Daniel wants to be an artist. Vince says that Daniel “dates girls I do n’t approve of.” “To date” a girl would be to go out on a date, a romantic meeting, w ith a girl (or boy). “I don’t approve of” is an expression we use to mean “I don’ t think is a good idea.” So, like I suppose a lot of sons, Daniel is going out o n dates, getting romantically involved, with women that Vince doesn’t approve of,  that his father doesn’t approve of.  

This never really happened to me. In fact, when I w ould come home with a girlfriend, my parents would always ask me why the girl was going out with me. They would tell the girl, “Hey, you can find somebo dy better than this guy, right?” So, I had the opposite problem. Vince, getting back  to our story, has a problem with his son, Daniel. He says, “This is beyond the bounds of what I’ll tolerate.”  

So, clearly Daniel has done something that Vince do esn’t like. He says it’s “beyond the bounds” (bounds) of what he’ll tolerate . If we say something is “beyond the bounds,” we mean it’s gone past what yo u think is acceptable. It has gone past the limits of something. Alana says, “I k now you’re upset, but don’t do anything rash.” “To do something rash” (rash) is to  do something in a hurry, quickly, but without thinking of what might happen,  the bad consequences of what might happen.  

We use this word especially when someone makes a qu ick decision about something in anger or because he’s frustrated, with out really thinking about it carefully and clearly. Alana says, “I’m sure Daniel  didn’t mean what he said.” Daniel has said something to Vince that Vince doesn ’t like. Alana is saying that he probably didn’t mean it, meaning he said it, but  he didn’t really believe it.  

Vince disagrees. He says, “Oh, he meant it. That’s it. I’m disowning and disinheriting him.” “To disown” (disown) someone is  to refuse to help or support one of your children, your son or your daughter. Yo u say, “I’m not going to have any relationship with that person. I’m not going to  help them. I’m not going to support them.” It is as if that person were no long er your child. That’s “to disown” someone. “To disinherit” (disinherit) means that yo u are not going to give anything to that person – any money or any property  – when you die.  

Normally, when your parents die, the money or posse ssions that they have would legally become yours – at least, unless they wrote out a special document called a “will” (will) that specifies where their money an d property should go after their deaths. So for a parent to disinherit a child is, o f course, a very serious thing. The parent is saying that the child will not get any of  their money or property when the parent dies. Alana tries to calm things down. She s ays, “I’m sure you don’t mean that. You both spoke in anger.”  

“To speak in anger” means to say something when you ’re mad, and often when we speak in anger, we say things that we don’t real ly mean. We say things to hurt another person or to get another person angry.  Alana says, “I’m sure a cooling-off period of a few days will change his,” meaning Daniel’s, “mind.” “To cool off” means to become calm and relaxed after yo u have been angry and upset. A “cooling-off period” would be time when tw o people agree basically not  

to communicate with each other, talk to each other,  so both of them can calm down.  

Vince says, “It’ll be too late. I’m cutting him out  of my will tomorrow.” We already explained what a will is. It’s a legal document tha t specifies where or to whom your money goes when you die. “To cut someone out o f your will” means to say this person was going to get some money, but now he ’s not. You’re eliminating that person from your will. You’re no longer giving  that person any money or property.  

Vince says, “I have other descendants who will appr eciate inheriting my money and property.” Your “descendants” (descendants) are  people who are related to you, but usually younger than you. Your children, y our grandchildren, your great- grandchildren – those people would be your descenda nts. “To inherit” (inherit) means to get money from someone who has died. Vince  is saying that he has other people who are related to him who will apprec iate his money and property when he dies, so he’s saying that other people will  be thankful and grateful for getting his money, unlike Daniel.  

Alana says, however, “Daniel is your rightful heir. ” Your “heir” (heir) is a person who receives your money or property when you die. U sually we talk about an heir when referring to children – the children that you have. Your “rightful (rightful) heir” is the person who should receive the money. I t is the person who – by custom, tradition, or law – gets your money and pro perty when you die.  

So, in the United States, for example, if you die a nd you don’t leave a will – that is, you don’t make a legal agreement or write out a  legal document specifying where your money and property should go when you di e – your rightful heirs are your children if you have children, or your spouse,  your husband or wife, if you’re married. What if you’re not married and have no chi ldren?  

Well, then the money goes to your closest relatives , perhaps a brother or a cousin or a nephew. If you’re writing out a will an d you don’t know whom you should give your money to, you should just put my n ame in there: Jeffrey McQuillan of Los Angeles, California. I’d be happy to take your money and property when you die, which I hope is not soon of course . . . not too soon.  

Alana reminds Vince that Daniel is his only child. Vince replies, “Then he should have known how his hateful words would hurt me.” Al ana says, “What did he say exactly?” meaning what were the words that Daniel u sed that made Vince so angry. Vince says, “He said he has become a San Fra ncisco Giants fan. A Giants fan!” he says in frustration. The San Franci sco Giants are a professional  

baseball team. As often happens in sports, differen t teams become rivals, meaning they compete against each other and have a particular dislike for each other.  

Here in California, we have several different profe ssional baseball teams, including the San Francisco Giants and my favorite team, which is the Los Angeles Dodgers. Sometimes two teams in particular are enemies of each other even more than they are of other teams, and that’s the case with the Giants and the Dodgers. Vince is saying that his son has becom e a San Francisco Giants fan, and we can guess that Vince is a Dodger fan. A lana is surprised that Vince is so angry about this.  

She says, “That’s it?” meaning that’s the only thin g he did to make you mad and to make you want to disown him? Vince is shocked: “ That’s it?! He’s wounded me to the core!” The phrase “to the core” (core) me ans completely and entirely. “To wound” (wound) someone is to hurt someone, eith er physically or, as is the case in our dialogue, psychologically or emotionall y. Vince is saying that his son has really hurt him by becoming a fan of the San Fr ancisco Giants, and frankly, I can understand what Vince is talking about here.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.  

[start of dialogue] 

Vince: That’s it! I’ve had it with Daniel defying m e at every turn. I want him to follow in my footsteps and study law, but he wants to be an artist. He dates girls I don’t approve of. But this! This is beyond the boun ds of what I’ll tolerate. 

Alana: I know you’re upset, but don’t do anything r ash. I’m sure Daniel didn’t mean what he said.  

Vince: Oh, he meant it. That’s it! I’m disowning an d disinheriting him.  

Alana: I’m sure you don’t mean that. You both spoke  in anger. I’m sure a cooling- off period of a few days will change his mind. 

Vince: It’ll be too late. I’m cutting him out of my  will tomorrow. I have other descendants who’ll appreciate inheriting my money a nd property.
