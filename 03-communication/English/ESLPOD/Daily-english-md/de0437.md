[start of dialogue]

Lucy:  I’m so excited!  My friend, Marlene, is coming to t own for a visit.

Buddy:  Have I met Marlene?

Lucy:  No, I don’t think so.  We grew up together and we were always joined at the hip.

Buddy:  When I was little, I had a friend like that.  We were blood brothers.

Lucy:  Yeah, Marlene and I did everything together and she was my confidant about everything.

Buddy:  She sounds like a great friend.

Lucy:  Yeah, she always had my back and I could always count on her to give it to me straight.

Buddy:  A friend like that is hard to come by.  Are you st ill close?

Lucy:  Not as close as I’d like.  We live in different citi es and it’s hard to keep up with what’s happening in each other’s lives.

 Buddy:  I can see that.  Does she know you’re getting marr ied?

Lucy:  No, I wanted to break the news to her face-to-face .

Buddy:  Why?  I would have thought you’d want to tell h er the good news right away.

Lucy:  Well, I want her to be my maid of honor and I’m  not sure how she’ll react to the dress she’ll have to wear.

Buddy:  Is it that bad?

Lucy:  My future mother-in-law picked it out and I can’t say “no.”  Here’s a picture of it.

Buddy:  Well, I’m glad she’s such a good friend, because i f anything can break up a friendship, it’s that  dress.

Lucy begins by says, “I’m so excited!  My friend, Marlene, is coming to town for a visit.”  She’s going to be coming to the city or town wh ere Lucy lives.  Lucy is talking to her friend Buddy; Buddy is his name.  “Buddy” is also a general term to describe a friend.  This is a term that children will of ten use, especially boys. They’ll say, “He’s my buddy” – he’s my friend.  But here, B uddy is his name.

Buddy says, “Have I met Marlene?”  Lucy says, “No, I don’t t hink so.  We grew up together and we were always joined at the hip.”  “ To grow up” means to get older, from childhood to adulthood.  It’s that period  between when you’re born and when you become an adult at 18 or 19.  “To grow u p together,” then, means to have lived in the same area, to have gone to the same  schools perhaps, and so forth.

Lucy says that she and Marlene were always joined at the hi p.  The “hip” (hip) is the part of your body that’s in the center where your w aist is, that is, where your legs meet the rest of your body.  The expression “to be jo ined at the hip” means to very close to someone else, in fact, you’re always with t hat person; you are inseparable; you spend a lot of time with that person.  “To be joined” means, here, to be connected.  So it is as if your bodies were co nnected.

 Buddy says, “When I was little, I had a friend like that.   We were blood brothers.” Your “blood brother” is a boy or a man with whom you have a very strong friendship.  Again, it’s something that would happen b etween boys or between men.  It’s your best friend, you say “he’s my blood brothe r” – he’s my best friend. You don’t mean your actual brother, the son of your mot her and father; it’s your best friend.

Lucy says, “Yeah, Marlene and I did everything together an d she was my confidant about everything.”  “Confidant” is a person w ith whom you can share your secrets, a person to whom you can say anything.  Someone  you can trust – your confidant.

Lucy says that Marlene was her confidant.  Buddy says, “She so unds like a great friend.”  Lucy says, “Yeah, she always had my back and I coul d always count on her to give it to me straight.”  “To have someone’s ba ck” means to defend someone, to help someone.  More generally, to look out for someone’s interests, to make sure that nothing bad happens to them.  You ma y be in a meeting, and your coworker is giving a presentation and he gets a lot of difficult questions. You decide to help him by answering some of the tough q uestions.  After the meeting, he says to you, “Thanks for having my back” – thanks f or defending and helping me.  Lucy also says that she can count on Marlene.  “To count on” someone is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to trust some one, to believe that someone will do something.  Your boss may say, “I’m counti ng on you to do a good job” – I’m relying on you; I am trusting you to d o a good job.

So, Lucy can count on Marlene “to give it to me straight. ”  “To give it to someone straight” means to tell someone the truth, even if it isn’t pleasant, even if it is difficult.  If someone asks you, “Tell me what you think of this shirt, give it to me straight,” that means they want your honest opinion even if it is not a good one.

So, Lucy’s friend always gives it to her straight.  Buddy says,  “A friend like that is hard to come by.”  “To be hard to come by” means to be  difficult to find or get; to be uncommon – not common.  Things that are hard to come  by are rare.  There was a famous short story in English by the Southern writer  Flannery O’Connor: A Good Man is Hard to Find .  We could say “a good man is hard to come by.”

Buddy says, “Are you still close?” meaning are you and Marl ene still close. “Close,” here, means do you have a comfortable, tight re lationship, especially between friends.  You may say, “Oh, I grew up with Steve  but we’re not close anymore” – we’re not that connected, we don’t talk to e ach other very often, and

 so forth.  “Close” has a couple of different meanings i n English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lucy responds by saying, “Not as close as I’d like.  We live in different cities and it’s hard to keep up with what’s happening in each oth er’s lives.”  “To keep up with something” means to be informed about something, to know what is happening, what changes are happening with something.  Someone says, “I don’t keep up with the news,” or “I don’t keep up with  the news about the economy.”  What they’re saying is they don’t know the late st, they don’t understand or they don’t know about what has changed or  happened in that particular area.

Lucy is saying it’s hard for her to keep up with what is ha ppening in Marlene’s life, to know the changes that are taking place, because they live in different cities.  Buddy says, “I can see that (meaning I understand).   Does she know you’re getting married?”  Lucy says, “No, I wanted to bre ak the news to her face- to-face.”  “To break the news” means to announce somethin g or to tell someone something usually, but not always, unpleasant or unexpect ed.  It could be just a surprise.  Sometimes if it’s bad news, the person will say, “Well, I hate to break the news to you, but...” and then they’ll tell you.  T hat expression, “I hate to break the news,” can also be used as a joke, meaning what you are telling them is something that is obvious: “I hate to break the news to yo u, but this is 2008.”  Of course, it’s obvious that it’s 2008, so the person is making  a joke.  Lucy is not making a joke; she’s going to give this surprise news to h er friend face-to-face. “Face-to-face” just means in person, in a situation wher e the two people are next to each other; they can see each other, not by phone or  email.  “Face-to-face” means that you are physically present in the same place – the same room – as the other person.

Buddy says, “Why?  I would have thought you’d want to tell  her the good news right away.”  Buddy is saying: “I thought you would want to tell her right away.” Lucy says, “I want her to be my maid of honor and I’m not  sure how she’ll react to the dress she’ll have to wear.”  The “maid of honor” i s usually the best friend of a woman who is getting married, and is part of what we call the “wedding party,” the group of people who are witnesses – supporters of t he person getting married.  Usually, the maid of honor has to wear a dre ss that the bride will typically pick out for her – will select for her.  Lucy says she ’s afraid how Marlene will react to the dress she has to wear.  Buddy says, “Is it that bad (is it very bad)?”  Lucy says, “My future mother-in-law picked it out a nd I can’t say ‘no.’” “To pick it out” means to select it, to choose it.  The ex pression has a couple of

 different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

So, her future “mother-in-law,” the mother of the m an she’s going to marry, selected the dress.  She shows buddy a picture of it, and B uddy says, “Well, I’m glad she’s such a good friend, because if anything can bre ak up a friendship, it’s that dress.”  In other words, the dress is really ugly and B uddy is saying: “Well, I’m glad you are good friends because if you were not, a sking someone to wear that dress would break up their friendship.”  “To bre ak up a friendship” or “to break up a marriage” means to end it, to ruin it.  “T o break up” can also mean to separate from someone, especially two people who are da ting.  They’re not married yet, they are boyfriend and girlfriend, and th en they decide to break up. They separate; they go and find new boyfriends and new g irlfriends.  Or, they go home and drink and watch baseball!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
