This episode is a dialogue between Alice and Sam ab out going out onto the street, onto the roads in a city or a town, and hav ing problems with the road conditions. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Alice:  I’m really glad I let you talk me into goin g for a bike ride.  It’s been years since I’ve been on a bicycle.

Sam:  This is the only way to travel.  You get to r eally see the scenery and enjoy the fresh air.

Alice:  Hey, watch out!  You almost dropped into th at huge pothole.  This asphalt is cracked and the road is all bumpy.

Sam:  Thanks for the warning.  Yeah, this asphalt r eally needs to be repaired.  I’d ride on the gravel path instead, but it’s full of r uts.  Oh, slow down!  There’s a big dip ahead.

Alice:  Whoa!  I didn’t see that coming.  I almost lost control on that slippery section of road.  Sorry, I nearly swerved into you.   Are you okay?

Sam:  Yeah, I’m fine.  When I suggested this route,  I was sure it would be an easy ride since it’s paved all the way.  I didn’t b argain for these lousy road conditions.

Alice:  We’ll just have to keep our eyes open and b e thankful for these crash helmets!

Sam:  You won’t blame me if you go flying, will you ?

 Alice:  Not if you break my fall.

[end of dialog]

Alice begins by saying to Sam, “I'm really glad” – I'm really happy –  “I let you talk me into going for a bike ride.” “To talk someone in to something” means to convince them, to persuade them, to get them to agr ee with your opinion of something. Alice and Sam are on a bike ride. “Bike”  (bike) is short for bicycle. Alice says “It's been years since I've been on a bi cycle.” “It's been years since I have been on a bicycle.” A “bicycle,” of course, ha s two wheels and a seat and what we call a “handlebar” that helps you steer or move the bicycle in the correct direction.

Sam says “This is the only way to travel.” This is not to be taken literally. Sam doesn't mean this is the only possible way in the w orld to travel. That expression, “This is the only way,” is used to indicate this is  the best way. This is the way that is better than any other way or method of traveling .

Sam says “You get to really see the scenery and enj oy the fresh air.” “Scenery” (scenery) is what you can see, usually outside of a  building, often referring to trees, lakes, things that are nice to look at, thin gs that are beautiful.

Alice says “Hey! Watch out! You almost dropped into  that huge pothole.” A “pothole” (pothole) is a hole in a street or a road , or a freeway, usually created by a lot of traffic, often caused by the change in tem perature that sometimes makes the surface of the street loose and then you get a hole in the street. We call those holes in the street “potholes.” Alice says Sam almo st went into one of the big potholes in the street.

She says, “This asphalt is cracked and the road is all bumpy.” “Asphalt” (asphalt) is a very common surface that we used to cover our streets and our roads, usually made by mixing small rocks with a very hot,  oily substance. It's usually black or a very deep kind of blue when you look at it. That's “asphalt.” Asphalt is used on most of the streets here in Los Angeles. It 's a cheap and effective way to cover the roads to make them smooth, but it's not p erfect. Asphalt can sometimes crack. When we talk about “cracked asphal t,” we mean there are little lines in the asphalt going through the surface wher e the asphalt appears to be separating. A “crack” is anytime you have some surf ace that appears to be separating, causing a line to go through it – what looks like a line. For example, if you have a glass and you hit the glass against the wall, the glass might break, or it might just crack. It might start to fall apart e ven though it’s still in one piece.

 The asphalt is cracked, according to Alice, and the  road is all bumpy. “Bumpy” (bumpy) means that it is uneven. Some areas are hig her than others. So as you drive down it, it's like you're going up and down. Your car moves up and down because the road isn't even. It isn't flat. Sam say s “Thanks for the warning. Yeah, this asphalt really needs to be repaired” – it need s to be fixed. “I’d ride on the gravel path instead, but it's full of ruts.” A “gra vel (gravel) path” is an area for bikes, or for people who are walking, that is not c overed with asphalt. Instead, it's covered with small, little rocks. Sam says he can't  go on the gravel path because it's full of ruts. A “rut” (rut) is basically the h ole in the ground that is made by wheels, many different wheels, going over the same spot. If you have a lot of bicycles or a lot of other wheels going over soft g round, and going over it in the same place over and over again, eventually you will  create a rut, which is a long line, a hole, really, in the ground that is caused by these wheels going over and over it.

Sam says, “Slow down. There's a big dip ahead.” A “ dip” (dip) is sort of like a hole. It's an area that's lower than the surroundin g area around it. Alice says, “Whoa! I didn't see that coming.” I didn't anticipa te that. “I almost lost control on that slippery section of the road.”

“To lose control” means you no longer have power to  change the direction that you are moving, or to change what is happening. Som e people may drink too much alcohol and lose control of themselves. They d on't have a way of controlling themselves because they drank too many beers – so don't drink too many beers, especially if you're bicycling! Alice p robably wasn't drinking…we don't know. It's possible Alice was  drinking before we started this dialog, but she doesn't appear to be drinking. The problem appears to be the road itself.

She says she lost control on that slippery section of road. Something that is “slippery” (slippery) is often covered with water o r ice, and is difficult to drive on because things keeps sliding off of it, or sliding around on it. Something that is slippery is something that could be very dangerous because as you walk over it or drive over it, you could suddenly move and then have a problem, possibly even an accident. If you walk on a street that is s lippery, you could fall, for example.

Alice is on a slippery section of the road. She say s, “Sorry. I nearly swerved into you.” “To swerve” (swerve) means to suddenly change  direction in an unexpected way, often to avoid hitting something el se. So, you have two cars traveling down the street and one of the cars sees a little cat that comes out onto the road. Well, some cars would continue driving, b ut most cars would swerve to

miss the cat. They would move the car over to the l eft or to the right suddenly in order not to hit the cat.

Sam says, “I'm fine.” Alice didn't hit him. He says , “When I suggested this route” – this path, this way of getting from one place to another – “I was sure it would be an easy ride since it's paved all the way.” “To be paved” (paved) means to put asphalt, cement, or something else on top of the gr ound, on top of the dirt, in order to make it easier to ride on. Sam says, “I di dn't bargain for these lousy road conditions.” The expression “to bargain for” means here to plan for, to expect something to be in a certain way. Sam says he did n ot plan for, or bargain for these lousy, or bad road conditions. The “condition  of something” is the situation that it is in. It is the state that it is in.

In this case, Sam is referring to bad road conditio ns – roads and streets that are not very easy to drive on. Alice says, “We’ll just have to keep our eyes open” – we’ll have to be alert – “and be thankful for these  crash helmets.” A “helmet” (helmet) is a protective hat that goes over your he ad on the top and on the sides to protect it. A “crash helmet” is something that s omeone riding a bicycle or a motorcycle might have on their head to protect it i n case they fell off of the bicycle or the motorcycle and hit the ground. The c rash helmet would protect their head.

Sam then says to Alice, “You won't blame me if you go flying, will you?” “To go flying,” in this case, would mean to hit something while you're riding the bike and to be thrown from the bike. You would fly in the ai r off the bike and onto the ground. Sam says “You won't blame me” – you won't t hink I'm guilty if that happens to you – will you, Alice? Alice says, “Not if you break my fall.” “To break (break) someone's fall” means to prevent them from getting hurt, by either catching them or by doing something that would prev ent them from hurting themselves by falling on the ground or some hard ob ject. That's Alice's little joke, of course. If Sam broke her fall, he would get hurt  as well, especially if Alice is a big woman…which I don't know if she is or not.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Alice:  I’m really glad I let you talk me into goin g for a bike ride.  It’s been years since I’ve been on a bicycle.

Sam:  This is the only way to travel.  You get to r eally see the scenery and enjoy the fresh air.

 Alice:  Hey, watch out!  You almost dropped into th at huge pothole.  This asphalt is cracked and the road is all bumpy.

Sam:  Thanks for the warning.  Yeah, this asphalt r eally needs to be repaired.  I’d ride on the gravel path instead, but it’s full of r uts.  Oh, slow down!  There’s a big dip ahead.

Alice:  Whoa!  I didn’t see that coming.  I almost lost control on that slippery section of road.  Sorry, I nearly swerved into you.   Are you okay?

Sam:  Yeah, I’m fine.  When I suggested this route,  I was sure it would be an easy ride since it’s paved all the way.  I didn’t b argain for these lousy road conditions.

Alice:  We’ll just have to keep our eyes open and b e thankful for these crash helmets!

Sam:  You won’t blame me if you go flying, will you ?

Alice:  Not if you break my fall.

She never loses control when she's writing her wond erful scripts. I speak, of course, of our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse .
