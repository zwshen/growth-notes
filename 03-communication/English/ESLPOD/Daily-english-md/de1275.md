[start of dialogue]

Harry: Our gig for this weekend is cancelled. They booked somebody else earlier but forgot.

Debbie: That’s a big bummer. I was counting on that  gig to pay rent.

Harry: Maybe I can get some session work at the stu dio.

Debbie: I’m so sick of being broke all the time.

Harry: I know, but this is our dream. We want to be  working musicians with a recording contract and worldwide tours, right? We a greed to devote all our time and energy to our music.

Debbie: That was the dream. The reality is that we’ re not doing too well. I’m thinking of packing it in.

Harry: You can’t! We agreed to give ourselves five years to make it. We both agreed that it’s better to have tried and failed th an never to have tried at all.

Debbie: But don’t you ever feel like giving up?

Harry: No! All we need is one big break.

Debbie: All right. I don’t want to think about it a nymore. Let’s rehearse.

Harry: I can’t. I’ve got to go.

Debbie: Where to?

Harry: To my brother’s restaurant. I agreed to wash  dishes there tonight.

Debbie: What happened to devoting all our time and energy to our music?

Harry: Even people with dreams have to eat.

Harry begins by saying, “Our gig for this weekend i s cancelled.” A “gig” (gig) is a performance where someone is paid usually to play m usic in front of people – either a musical instrument or perhaps to sing. Har ry says that their gig for this weekend “is cancelled,” meaning they were supposed to have a performance but now they are not. He says, “They,” whoever they are , “booked somebody else earlier but forgot.” “They,” I guess, would be the owners of the place where they were going to perform.

“To book” (book) means to make arrangements to do s omething in the future. We use this verb in a lot of cases related to travel. You can “book a hotel.” You can “book an airplane flight.” In this case, it refers to a hotel or restaurant or bar arranging for someone to perform music in their est ablishment where they are. Harry says the place where they were going to perfo rm “had already booked somebody else but they forgot.” And so they also bo oked Harry and Debbie’s group.

Debbie says, “That’s a big bummer” (bummer). “Bumme r” is an informal word, a slang term, really, that describes something that i s very disappointing, something that makes you feel sad. It’s a word that was proba bly more popular twenty, thirty years ago than it is now, but you still hear it. De bbie continues, “I was counting on that gig to pay rent.” “To count (count) on” som ething or someone means to rely or depend on that thing or person. You are pre paring for the future based on something you are expecting to happen. Debbie was “ counting on the money” that she would have received from that performance,  that gig, to pay her rent.

Harry says, “Maybe I can get some session work at t he studio.” A “studio” (studio) is a room or building where music is recor ded. “Session (session) work” refers to time spent playing an instrument or singi ng with another group or band. Here in Los Angeles, for example, there are a lot of music studios and a lot of musicians, many of whom work doing session recordin gs. They are not recording

for their own bands. They are working with other mu sicians, other bands, other singers and playing with them. “Session work” is so mething many professional musicians count on in order to make a living – in o rder to have enough money to live.

Debbie says, “I’m so sick of being broke all the ti me.” If someone is “sick of” something, he is tired of it. He no longer wants th at particular thing. “I am sick of eating rice every day for lunch.” I want something different. Debbie is “sick of being broke” (broke). “To be broke” means not to ha ve any money. Harry says, “I know,” meaning I understand, “but this is our dream .” This is what you want. This is your hope for the future. “We want to be working  musicians with a recording contract and worldwide tours, right?”

Here he’s asking a question. Here he’s saying, “Don ’t you and I want to be working musicians with a recording contract?” A “re cording contract” is a legal agreement that you have with a music company. The m usic company pays you money and you record music that will be sold. A “to ur” (tour) is when you go from one place to another, performing something – in thi s case, performing music. Harry and Debbie want to be musicians with a “recor ding contract” and “worldwide tours,” meaning they go and perform thei r music all over the world.

Harry continues, “We agreed to devote all our time and energy to our music.” “To devote” (devote) means to give your time, money, or  other resources to a particular cause or for a particular goal. “I’m going to devote my time to studying Italian.” I’m going to spend an hour a day reading Italian to make my Italian vocabulary and grammar better. That, by the way, is  an excellent way to improve your English, in addition to listening to our episo des. Read at least a half hour every day, and your English will get better over ti me.

Well, Harry and Debbie want to devote all of their time and energy to their music. Debbie says, “That was the dream,” meaning yes, tha t’s what we thought. However, she continues, “The reality is that we’re not doing too well. I’m thinking of packing it in.” “Reality” (reality) is the way t hings actually are – not what we think or pretend or imagine, but the way the world actually is. Real life. Debbie says the reality of their lives is that they’re not  doing very well.

She says, “I’m thinking of packing it in.” The expr ession “to pack (pack) it in” means to give up, to stop doing something, usually because it’s too difficult. Harry says, “You can’t,” meaning you cannot pack it  in. You can’t stop. “We agreed to give ourselves five years to make it.” the expression “to make (make) it” means to succeed, to be successful, to get what  you want. Harry and Debbie

told themselves, agreed to themselves, to give them selves five years to make it, meaning they would try for five years to be success ful.

“We both agreed,” Harry continues, “that it’s bette r to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all.” This is an old express ion. “It’s better to have tried,” meaning it is better to have attempted something, “ and failed,” and not succeeded, “than never to have tried at all.” Basic ally the expression is saying that you should try something even if you’re not su ccessful, because it’s better to try and not be successful than never to attempt it in the first place. This is used to motivate people to get people who are having a hard  time or who are having difficulties to continue on or to try something eve n though it might be difficult.

Debbie says, “But don’t you ever feel like giving u p?” “To give up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning the same as “to pack it in” – to stop trying. Harry says, “No! All we need is one big break.” A “break” (break) he re refers to a good opportunity, a chance to do something. A “big break ,” then, would be a good opportunity to be successful. They often use this t erm in the entertainment industry, such as music or acting, to refer to that  one opportunity that will make you famous or that will give you the chance to be s uccessful.

Debbie says, “All right. I don’t want to think abou t it anymore. Let’s rehearse.” “To rehearse” (rehearse) means to practice usually musi c, although we also use this verb “to rehearse” for actors who are getting ready  for a performance, such as a play. Debbie says, “Let’s rehearse.” Harry says, “I  can’t. I have to go,” meaning I have to leave. Debbie says, “Where to?” Where are y ou going? Harry says, “To my brother’s restaurant. I agreed to wash dishes th ere tonight.”

Debbie asks, “What happened to devoting all our tim e and energy to our music?” Harry was talking about how important it was for the two of them to spend all of their time working on their music, and here he’s no w going to work in his brother’s restaurant. Harry explains, “Even people with dreams have to eat.” He’s saying that even though he has the dream of being a  successful musician, he still needs to make money in order to buy food to eat.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
