This episode is a dialogue between Una and Jackson about problems that can happen when you are moving things from one place to  another. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Una: Get on the horn and find out where our cargo i s.

Jackson: I’ve been trying. Last week, I finally rea ched someone at the transport company and all they would tell me was that due to unforeseen circumstances, there will be a delay in delivery.

Una: Didn’t they give you any details?

Jackson: None at all. When I called again two days later, I spoke with someone else who said there may have been a mishap in trans it, such as a truck breakdown or accident.

Una: But our cargo is being shipped by sea.

Jackson: That’s what I told her. She said the delay  could be due to something as simple as bad weather and that our cargo probably h asn’t been captured for ransom or lost at sea.

Una: Captured for ransom?! Lost at sea?!

Jackson: She said that probably hasn’t happened. Wh en I called again yesterday, I was told the cargo had arrived at the port, but that there’s a problem.

Una: What kind of problem?

 Jackson: The person I spoke to didn’t know, but tho ught that it could be a delay in customs clearance or even a loss of refrigeratio n.

Una: A loss of refrigeration?! That would be disast rous.

Jackson: I know, but then again, who thought transp orting Alaska snow to California was a good idea?

Una: Our wonderful director, remember?

Our dialogue begins with Una saying to Jackson, “Ge t on the horn and find out where our cargo is.” The expression “get on the hor n” (horn) is a somewhat old expression, but you will still hear people using it . That means to make a phone call or to call someone by telephone. Una tells Jac kson to “get on the horn and find out,” or determine, where their “cargo” (cargo ) is. “Cargo” refers to things that are moved or transported by truck, train, or ship, that are usually large and heavy.

We think about “cargo” as being large boxes or larg e containers that have things in them. On an airplane, for example, the cargo usu ally goes on the bottom of the plane. Your “luggage” – that is, your suitcases – a re cargo, at least they are when they are put together with a bunch of other su itcases and placed on the bottom of the plane. You can move cargo by train or  ship or truck. Cargo is usually, but not always, things that are being sold  that are being moved from one company to another.

Jackson says, “I’ve been trying” – that is, I’ve be en trying to find out where our cargo is. “Last week,” he says, “I finally reached someone,” meaning I finally was able to talk to someone, “at the transport company. ” A “transport (transport) company” is a business that moves things from one p lace to another. The verb “to transport” means to move something. So, a “tran sport company” would be a company that moves things, usually for other compan ies, in a truck, a plane, or perhaps a ship or train.

Jackson says the transport company said “that due t o unforeseen circumstances,” there was going to be a delay in de livery. “Unforeseen” (unforeseen) is something that you don’t anticipate , that you don’t predict. Something that is unexpected is “unforeseen.” “Unfo reseen circumstances”

would be a situation usually when something goes wr ong that you didn’t expect. And of course, we never expect anything to go wrong , do we?

“There will be a delay in delivery,” Jackson says, because of these unforeseen circumstances, these unforeseen situations. A “dela y” (delay) is a period of time longer than expected. When you go to the airport an d your plane doesn’t leave at the time it’s supposed to, we would say the plane h as been “delayed,” using it as a verb, or simply that there has been “a delay,” us ing it as a noun. A “delay” is when things are taking longer than expected or are not happening at the time they should.

“Delivery” is moving something from one place to an other, usually from the company that sells the product to the company or pe rson that is buying the product. You can get “food delivery.” You can get a  restaurant to bring food to your house, or some other company will pick up your  food at the restaurant and bring it to your house. If you call a restaurant to  order some food, they may ask you, “Is that for pickup or delivery?” “Pickup” mea ns you will go and pick up, or get, the food. “Delivery” means they will bring the  food to you.

Una says, “Didn’t they give you any details?” She’s  asking Jackson if the company explained why there was a delay. Jackson sa ys, “None at all,” meaning no, they didn’t give me any specific information. T hey didn’t give me any details. He says, “When I called again two days later, I spo ke with someone else who said there may have been a mishap in transit, such as a truck breakdown or accident.” A “mishap” (mishap) is when something bad happens that creates a problem.

Another word for a “mishap” would be simply an “acc ident” – something bad that happens that you, of course, didn’t expect. “In tra nsit” (transit) means while you are transporting or moving something. A “mishap in transit” means something bad happened during the process of moving things fr om one place to another. One possible thing that might have caused this dela y is a “truck breakdown” (breakdown). A “breakdown” is when a machine stops working – in this case, a truck.

Una says, “But our cargo is being shipped by sea.” “To ship” (ship) something is usually to send something either using the official  government mail service or a private delivery system or service, such as UPS or Federal Express or DHL. Una says that their cargo “is being shipped,” or transp orted, “by sea,” meaning in a boat or ship. So, a truck accident couldn’t be the reason why there is a delay.

Jackson says, “That’s what I told her,” meaning tha t’s also the same thing I told the woman I spoke with. “She said the delay could b e due to something as simple as bad weather and that our cargo probably h asn’t been captured for ransom or lost at sea.” The woman Jackson spoke wit h said the delay “could be due to something as simple as bad weather,” meaning  maybe the reason there is a delay is there was bad weather that prevented or slowed down the transport.

Then the woman at the transport company told Jackso n that the cargo “probably,” meaning most likely, “has not been capt ured for ransom or lost at sea.” Well, of course, these are two very bad thing s that you would not expect to happen. One thing is that your cargo would be “capt ured for ransom.” “To capture” (capture) something is to take something, to steal something. “Ransom” (ransom) is when you ask someone for money to get s omething or someone returned to that person.

Usually we think about ransom with what is called a  “kidnapping” – when someone is taken against his will and held until so meone pays you money. Here, Jackson is talking about the possibility of their c argo being “captured for ransom,” or even worse, “lost at sea.” If something is “lost  at sea,” basically a boat or ship has sunk, has gone down into the water, and so has your cargo. So you’ll never get it back. Una is shocked. She’s surprised that J ackson is talking about these terrible things that might have happened, such as “ captured for ransom” and “lost at sea.”

Jackson says, “She said that probably hasn’t happen ed. When I called again yesterday, I was told the cargo had arrived at the port, but that there’s a problem.” A “port” (port) is a place where many shi ps, large ships, come and bring cargo which is then delivered to trucks or ot her means of transportation. Here in Los Angeles, we have the Port of Los Angele s, where ships from all over the Pacific, largely from Asia, come and bring thin gs to the United States – cargo which is then put on either trucks or trains and th en delivered to different parts of the U.S.

Jackson says that their cargo has arrived at the po rt – so it was not lost at sea – but still there is a problem. Una says, “What kind of problem?” Jackson says, “The person I spoke to didn’t know, but thought tha t it could be a delay in customs clearance or even a loss of refrigeration.”  “Customs” (customs) here refers to the process of the government approving e ntry of certain things into a country. When you go to another country, you usuall y have to go through customs. They make sure you’re not bringing anythin g into the country you’re not supposed to or that you’re not paying for properly.

“Clearance” (clearance) is the process of the gover nment officials approving your cargo, in this case – saying yes, it’s okay, there’ s no problem, you can bring this into the country. Jackson says that maybe the delay  in getting their cargo was due to “customs clearance issues” or, he says, “a l oss of refrigeration.” “Refrigeration” (refrigeration) is the process of k eeping something cold. So, if your cargo is food and you are sending it in a ship  over many, many miles, you will want it to keep cold so that the food doesn’t go bad.

A “loss of refrigeration” would mean that for some reason the ship was unable to keep the food cold. That’s why Una says, “A loss of  refrigeration?! That would be disastrous” (disastrous). “Disastrous” comes from t he word “disaster,” which is a terrible event, a terrible thing that happens. An e arthquake that kills many people is a “disaster.” Una says that a loss of refrigerat ion would be “disastrous” for her and her company.

Jackson says, “I know” – meaning yes, I understand that that would be disastrous – “but,” he says, “then again, who thoug ht transporting Alaska snow to California was a good idea?” The phrase “then again ” is used when we are going to present a new idea after thinking about it some more. Usually we use this when we’re going to present a different idea from t he one we just talked about, or perhaps to provide a different perspective on thing s compared to what we just said.

I could say, for example, “I want to go to the movi es, but then again, there aren’t any good movies I really want to see.” “But then ag ain” introduces a different idea that contrasts or is somehow providing a different perspective than the first idea. Jackson says, “Who thought transporting Alaska snow  to California was a good idea?” Now we find out what the cargo that is being  sent to their company is. It’s snow from Alaska.

Jackson, of course, doesn’t think this was a good i dea. Una says, “Our wonderful director, remember?” We learn that this company doe sn’t belong to Una because she’s not the boss. The person who is the boss is t he “director” (director). A “director” is a person who leads an organization or  part of an organization. Una says, “Our wonderful director,” but she of course i s making a joke. She doesn’t think the director is wonderful because he or she h ad this very dumb idea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
