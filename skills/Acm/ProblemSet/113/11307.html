<p>Given a graph, we define "proper coloring" as coloring of the graph nodes
in such way that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If we map each color to
a positive integer, we can calculate the sum of all colors assigned to the graph.</p>

<p>In this problem you will be given a tree (connected graph with no simple loops). Can you determine
what the minimum color sum can be achieved when the tree is properly colored?
(Image to the right shows a proper coloring of the second example tree with sum=11)</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with <em>n</em> (1 &le; <em>n</em> &le; 10000),
the number of nodes in the tree. Next <em>n</em> lines will be of the form "<em>u: v1 v2 ... vk"</em> where <em>u</em> is the root
of a subtree and <em>vi</em>'s are its children (0 &le; <em>u, vi</em> &le; <em>n</em>-1).</p>
<p>Every test case will be followed by a blank line. Input ends with a case <em>n</em>=0, which should not be processed.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print the minimum sum of colors that can be achieved by some proper coloring of the tree.</p>
