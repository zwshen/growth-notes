This episode is called “An Unwelcome Business in th e Neighborhood.” Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Patricia: Finally! That empty building has a new te nant. That’s great for the neighborhood. 

Francois: Think again. The new tenant plans to open  a strip club. 

Patricia: A strip club in the middle of a residenti al neighborhood?! That must be a violation of city ordinances. The city won’t allow that.  

Francois: I’m not so sure. The tenant has already s tarted moving in, and there is no sign that the city is going take action. 

Patricia: Then we have to do something to let the c ity know that we object to a strip club going into that space.  

Francois: Good luck getting the city to do anything , much less file an injunction. The mayor is very pro-business, and it won’t look g ood if he tries to shut down any business that could bring revenue and jobs to t his dying town. 

Patricia: But at what cost? Our kids will have to w alk past the strip club every day to and from school. That’s outrageous! 

Francois: I suggest channeling that energy into act ion. If we make a stink and get media coverage, maybe we’ll get some action. 

Patricia: Good idea. How can we get the local media  to cover a neighborhood protest? 

Francois: How about nude picketing?  

Patricia: I think that would send the wrong message .

The dialogue for this episode is entitled “An Unwel come Businesses in the Neighborhood.” When we say a business or a person i s “unwelcome,” we mean they are not welcome. The prefix “-un” in English m eans “not.” To say someone is a “welcome visitor” or a “welcome business” mean s you want them there. You are happy that the person or the business is there.  So, if you have an unwelcome business, you have a business that you don’t want i n your neighborhood – the area where you live in your city or town.  

Patricia begins our dialogue by saying, “Finally!” – at last! – “That empty building has a new tenant. That’s great for the neighborhood .” A “tenant” (tenant) is a business or a person who rents a certain house or b uilding. A tenant is someone who pays rent, who pays money, to usually live in o r work in a certain area. So, if you have an apartment, you will have to pay rent, a nd that makes you a tenant. Patricia is happy that the empty building near thei r house has a new tenant. 

Francois doesn’t think this is good news. He says t o Patricia, “Think again.” Patricia says it’s great news, but Francois says, “ Think again.” “Think again” means you should consider this situation again. You  should think about it again. Usually, it means the other person is wrong. The co nclusion that the other person has reached is incorrect in your view.  

So, if someone says to you, “Oh, I’m going to go to  Minnesota” – in the northern part of the U.S., where I’m from – “for a winter va cation. I’m going to bring my bathing suit and my sunglasses because I expect it will be very warm and sunny,” someone from Minnesota would say to you, “T hink again,” meaning you’re wrong. The way you are thinking is not corre ct, or you have reached an incorrect conclusion.  

Francois says, “The new tenant plans to open a stri p club.” A “strip club” is a place where, typically, women take their clothes of f for men. Patricia says, “A strip club in the middle of a residential neighborh ood? That must be a violation of city ordinances. The city won’t allow that.” Patric ia is surprised that this kind of  

business – which of course you would not want near your house, if anywhere – is opening up in the middle of a residential neighborh ood.  

A “neighborhood” is an area of a town or a city. “R esidential” (residential) refers to homes and apartments and condominiums. A “reside nt” is a person who lives in a certain area. “Residential” refers to an area where there are mostly houses and apartments. The opposite of “residential” is “c ommercial.” A commercial area has mostly businesses and stores, but residential a reas have mostly houses and apartments.  

Patricia says that they can’t open this kind of bus iness in the middle of a residential neighborhood. She says, “That must be a  violation of city ordinances.” A “violation” is when you break the law or you brea k some rules. You don’t follow some regulation. That would be a violation. “Ordina nces” (ordinances) are laws, usually laws for a city or a town. It could be laws  for a county, I suppose, also. Normally, the word “ordinance” is used to refer to a law of a city or a town.  

Patricia says, “The city won’t allow that.” The cit y won’t permit that. Francois says, “I’m not so sure. The tenant has already star ted moving in, and there is no sign that the city is going to take action.” Franco is says the tenant has already started “moving in.” The person has already started  to bring things into the building. He also says there is no sign, there is n o indication, that the city – the government of the city – is going to take action. “ To take action” here means to do something.  

Patricia says, “Then we have to do something to let  the city know that we object to a strip club going into that place.” “To object (object) to” something is to express your disagreement about something, to prote st about something, to let people know that you don’t like something.  

If you watch a crime show in English, a television program about the law and courtrooms and judges, you will probably hear this word “object.” It’s something that the lawyers say when they don’t like what the other side has said or they don’t think what the other side has said should be part of the legal case. The lawyers will often stand up and say, “I object, You r Honor.” “Your Honor” here refers to the judge. Well, here we’re talking about  “objecting to” something – objecting to this business coming into the neighbor hood. 

Francois says, “Good luck getting the city to do an ything.” When he says, “Good luck,” he’s not actually wishing Patricia good luck . What he’s really doing is indicating that what she wants will not happen, or that what she is hoping to happen probably won’t happen. Francois says, “Good luck getting the city to do  

anything, much less file an injunction.” An “injunc tion” (injunction) is when the government, often the court, will tell someone or s ome business that they can’t do something. They stop someone from doing somethin g that they’ve believed to be illegal.  

That’s what Francois is referring to here. He doesn ’t think the city is going to file an injunction. The verb “file” (file) here means si mply to try to get an injunction from a judge. An injunction has to come from a judg e, from a court. But the city government – the mayor or other people who work for  the city – can ask the judge to stop a business from doing something. That  would be “filing an injunction” – asking the judge to stop this person from doing something. 

Francois says, “The mayor,” who is the leader of th e city or town, “is very pro- business, and it won’t look good if he tries to shu t down any businesses that could bring revenue and jobs to this dying town.” T he mayor is very “pro- business.” When we say someone is “pro (pro) – some thing,” we mean they are in favor of, or they support, that thing.  

So, someone who is “pro-business” is someone who is  in favor of business, who tries to help companies. Someone who is “pro-labor”  (labor) would be someone who is trying to help workers, especially labor uni ons. So, you’ll see that prefix “pro-” in front of a word when someone is in favor of that or supports that. The mayor is “pro-business,” Francois says, and it won’ t look good if he tries to “shut down” this business. “To shut down” is a two-word p hrasal verb meaning “to close.”  

The mayor is interested in the “revenue and jobs” t hat the business can bring to this dying town. “Revenue” (revenue) refers to mone y, specifically taxes that the business will pay the city. Patricia says, “But at what cost? Our kids will have to walk past the strip club every day to and from scho ol. That’s outrageous!” “Outrageous” means that’s crazy. That’s a terrible thing.  

Francois says, “I suggest channeling that energy in to action.” “To channel (channel) your energy into” something means to put your energy into something. “To channel” anything means to take it and use it f or a specific purpose. He continues, “If we make a stink and get media covera ge, maybe we’ll get some action.” “To make a stink” (stink) is an interestin g expression. It means to create problems so that other people notice that you don’t  like something. You complain or you do something to get attention so that other people will realize that you’re not happy and, you hope, do something about it.  

“Media coverage” refers to newspapers, television s tations, radio stations, magazines, or Internet websites talking about your issue or talking about you. Media coverage is when the press, the media – the n ewspapers and television stations – talk about your story. They tell other p eople about what you are doing. Patricia says, “Good idea,” meaning that’s a good i dea; we should make a stink.  

“How do we get the local media to cover a neighborh ood protest?” Patricia is thinking of an idea to get the local media – the ne wspapers and television stations in that town or city – “to cover,” that is  to report on, the neighborhood protest. A “protest” is when you get together in pu blic to indicate your belief about something, often your unhappiness about something.  

Now remember, they’re protesting a strip club, a pl ace where usually men pay money to see women take their clothes off. So, Fran cois suggests “nude picketing.” “To picket” (picket) means to walk back  and forth on the sidewalk with signs in the air that indicate what you are angry a bout, what you are protesting about. “Nude” (nude) means without any clothing on.   

Francois is suggesting that they could get attentio n from the local media if they picketed without wearing any clothing. Of course, t hey’re nude because that’s of course the kind of business that a strip club is. S o, they are calling attention to this issue. Patricia says, however, “I think that w ould send the wrong message.” The expression “to send the wrong message” means yo u are doing something that will give people the wrong idea about what you  want or what you are trying to accomplish.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
