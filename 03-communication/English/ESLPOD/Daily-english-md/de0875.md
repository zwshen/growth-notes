This episode is a dialogue between someone who work s at a grocery store, a store where you buy food, and a customer. Let’s get  started.

[start of dialog]

Stocker:  Can I help you find something?

Meg:  Yes, I’m looking for coffee.

Stocker:  That’s on aisle 3.  Let me show you where  it is.

Meg:  Thanks.  Hmm, I don’t see the Jitters brand t hat I normally buy.

Stocker:  It looks like we’re out of stock.  We sho uld get another shipment next week.

Meg:  Okay, I’ll check back.  I’m also looking for the Fructose brand soda, but I didn’t see it in the soda aisle.

Stocker:  I’m afraid that’s been discontinued.  The ir parent company no longer makes soda.

Meg:  Really?  I love Fructose soda.  How about the  Mushy brand bread?  I didn’t see it when I checked the bread aisle.

Stocker:  We no longer stock the Mushy brand.  Ther e were so quality control issues at the company, so we’ve pulled all of their  products from the shelves. Can I help you find anything else?

Meg:  No, I guess I’ll just have to try some new br ands.  Oh, yes, do you carry Worm organic apples?

Stocker:  We normally do, but they’re out of season  right now.  We won’t have any until early summer.

Meg:  All of this shopping and I have nothing to sh ow for it.  I guess I’m going home empty-handed.

Stocker:  We do have chocolate cakes and cookies on  sale.

Meg:  I’m there!

The person who begins our dialogue is an employee o f the grocery store, of the supermarket. He's what we would call a “stocker” (s tocker). A “stocker” is a person who puts the products, who puts the food ite ms, on the shelves. He or she is the person who takes them out of a box and p uts them up in a place where you can see them, take them, and then buy them.

The stocker says to one of the customers, named Meg , “Can I help you find something?” Meg says, “Yes I'm looking for coffee.”  The stocker says, “That’s on aisle 3. Let me show you where it is.” “Aisle” (ais le) refers to a passage, a place where you can walk in between two other things. In this case, in a grocery store, in a supermarket, you have long shelves and the she lves are arranged so that you can walk in between them in order to find what you need and take it off the shelf. That space where you walk, that area where y ou walk, is called an “aisle.” Many supermarkets number the aisles so that if you are looking for something – as Meg was looking for coffee – the person can just  tell you where to go. “It's on aisle 3.” “It's on aisle 4.” Then you know exactly where you need to go.

Meg says, “Thanks. I don't see the Jitters brand I normally buy.” Meg is looking for a particular kind of coffee, a specific “brand”  (brand). “Brand” is the name that the company gives their product. You could have Die t Coke. That would be a brand. Or, we have something here in the US called “Coke Zero.” That's the brand, or “Coca-Cola” itself could be considered a brand. Meg is looking for a particular kind of coffee and she doesn't see it th ere. The stocker says, “It looks like we’re out of stock.” “To be out of stock” mean s not to have available for sale something that you normally sell. Normally, they se ll this kind of coffee, but everyone came in and bought it, and now they don't have any more. They're out of stock. “Stock,” I should say, refers to the thin gs that the store sells. The

opposite of out of stock is “in stock.” “Do you hav e this in stock?” That means “Do you have that item available for sale?”

The coffee Meg wants is out of stock. The stocker t ells her though that they should get another shipment next week. A “shipment”  (shipment) is when you get a large group of something delivered to your house or more typically, to your business – in this case, to the supermarket. Maybe every day they'll get a new shipment of vegetables, boxes of vegetables that wi ll come in and they will sell. That's a shipment.

Meg says, “Okay, I'll check back.” “To check back” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to come back at a later time to see if you have it. “I'll check back next week” means I will come back next week and see if y ou have it. Meg says, “I'm also looking for the Fructose brand soda but I don' t see it in the soda aisle.” The stocker says, “I'm afraid” – I'm sorry to tell you – “that's been discontinued.” “To discontinue” something is to no longer make it avai lable, perhaps because it isn't very popular. Or maybe it was just too expensive for the store to buy and sell – “to discontinue,” to stop making something availabl e.

The stocker says the “parent company” of the brand that Meg wants “no longer makes soda.” A “parent company” is a large company that owns usually smaller divisions or smaller sections of their company that  make different kinds of products. The parent company is the company that is  in charge of all the other small companies, or in this case, divisions of that  company. Meg says, “Really? I love Fructose soda.” She's disappointed. Then she a sks, “How about the Mushy Bran bread?” “How about” means “Do you have,” in th is case, “the Mushy brand bread.” These are not, I should say, real brands th at you will find in an American supermarket.

Meg says, “I didn't see the Mushy brand bread when I checked the bread aisle.” The stocker says, “We no longer stock the Mushy bra nd.” Here, notice “stock” is used as a verb, meaning to make available, to carry , to keep something available to sell. The stocker is saying the supermarket no l onger stocks this brand. It is no longer available. The company is still making that bread but this sup ermarket no longer stocks it. He says, “There were some quality control issues at  the company so we pulled all of our products from the shelves.”

“Quality control” refers to the process, the steps that a company has to make sure that what they make is good quality, is what i t is supposed to be. The stocker says this company had some quality control issues. He really means “problems.” So, the supermarket pulled their produc ts. “To pull” here means to

stop selling something to your customers, to no lon ger make it available for sale. That's what the stocker means here when he says tha t “We've pulled all their products.” He says, “We’ve pulled all their product s from the shelves.”

“Shelves” is the plural of “shelf” (shelf). A “shel f,” as I mentioned earlier, is a place where the food is put so that you can see it,  and take it, and buy it. That's a shelf. It's a place where you place things, you put  things either for someone to buy or simply to keep them there. Shelves usually h ave three or four different sections in a grocery store and each section has a space in between it so that you can put the products there.

The stocker says, “Can I help you find anything els e?” Meg says, “No. I guess I'll just have to try some new brands. Oh yes, do you ca rry Worm organic apples?” “To carry” here means to sell in your store, to hav e in stock or to normally have in stock. Something that you normally sell is somethin g that you carry. Meg is asking if the supermarket carries a certain kind of  organic apple. “Organic” (organic) refers to food that is grown without any artificial or extra chemicals. Organic food is very popular now in certain parts o f the United States and other countries, of course.

The stockers says, “We normally do” – we normally d o have these kinds of apples in stock – “but they're out of season right now.” “To be out of season” means that this particular food is not being grown or is not available in a certain area. If you only want to buy food that is grown fr om your local area, from your area where you live, there'll be parts of the year when certain kinds of food is not available because it's not being grown in that area  at that time.

In Minnesota, for example, where it’s very cold, yo u can't get any fresh vegetables during the wintertime because they're no t able to grow the food at that time. Of course, you can get vegetables. You c an get them from other parts of the country or other parts of the world and that 's exactly what we do, but if you only want to buy them from a certain area, it's lik ely that that area, at some point during the year, will not have that food available and therefore it will be “out of season.”

The stocker says, “We won't have any of these apple s until early summer.” Meg says, “All of this shopping and I have nothing to s how for it.” The expression “to have nothing to show for it” means “I've done a lot  of work but I don't have any results. I don't have what I wanted to have.” Meg s ays, “I guess I'm going home empty-handed.” “To be empty (empty) - handed (hande d)” means you don't have anything. Literally, you don't have anything in you r hands. Your hands are empty.

“To go home empty-handed” means to go home without have purchased or bought anything.

The stocker says, “We do have chocolate cakes and c ookies on sale.” The stocker is telling Meg that even though they don't have these other kinds of food, they still have cakes and cookies. Meg gets excited  and says, “I'm there.” “I'm there” is a phrase that we use informally to show t hat you plan on doing something and that you are very excited about it. S omeone may say, “Oh, the new Star Wars movie is coming out next year.” And y ou say, “Oh, I’m there,” meaning I am definitely going to be there.

I probably will not be there, but that's how we wou ld use that particular expression.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
