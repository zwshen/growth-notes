This episode is a dialogue between Lily and Omid ab out kinds of apartments. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lily: Thanks for coming with me to meet the rental agent to view an apartment, but I think I’m lost. I’m supposed to be there in 1 0 minutes, but I can’t find it. There are four different apartment complexes locate d next to each other and they look identical.

Omid: Don’t you have the address?

Lily: Yes, but all of the complexes in this subdivi sion look the same, and I don’t see a street number on any of them.

Omid: Are you sure we’re looking for a block of apa rtments? Maybe the apartment is in a mixed-use building, like that one  over there.

Lily: I’m pretty sure. At least I know it’s in a hi gh-rise building and the apartment is on the eighth floor. That mixed-use building is only three stories high.

Omid: Oh, then it’s not a duplex or triplex, like t hose over there.

Lily: No, it’s definitely not one of those. I’d bet ter call the rental agent and get directions.

Omid: Hey, look over there. I see a couple of the r esidents of that building walking out. Let’s ask them. Excuse me. Excuse me! Oh, they didn’t hear me.

Lily: I’ll just make the call.

Omid: Well, you can be sure of one thing if you mov e into one of these complexes.

Lily: What?

Omid: The bill collectors will never be able to fin d you!

Our dialogue begins today with Lily saying to Omid,  “Thanks for coming with me to meet the rental agent to view an apartment.” A “ rental agent” is a person whose job it is to help people find a home or an ap artment to rent. It’s a person who helps people who are renting, also, to find som eone to rent their apartment or home.

The word “agent” (agent), when describing a person,  often refers to someone who represents the interests of another party – ano ther person or organization. We have “real estate agents” who are responsible for buying and selling homes or helping people buy and sell homes.

Lily is going with Omid to meet a rental agent who’ s going to show them an apartment. When we say “apartment” in American Engl ish, we’re usually referring to a room or set of rooms in a building. The rooms are all connected. There’s typically a bedroom and a living room and a kitchen  and a bathroom. Usually the rooms are on one level, or one “floor.” An apartmen t is what someone can rent to live in.

There are other kinds of properties that you can re nt. Condominiums are also one-level, typically, living units or areas. Howeve r, an apartment is rented, whereas a condominium is typically owned by someone . Now, you could own a condominium and then rent it, so the distinction ge ts a little fuzzy – it gets a little difficult to make.

There are a couple of other terms that we use when talking about rental properties. One of them is “townhouse.” A “townhous e” is typically an apartment that’s more than one level, that’s more than one st ory – that has a first level and a second level, possibly even a third level. Here, however, we’re looking at an apartment. Lily says, “I think I’m lost. I’m suppos ed to be there in 10 minutes, but I can’t find it.” Lily says she’s “lost,” meaning s he doesn’t know where she is.

She then says, “There are four different apartment complexes located next to each other and they look identical.” An “apartment complex” (complex) is a set of buildings, usually, that look the same or very simi lar, that are next to each other and usually owned by the same company. An apartment  complex usually implies that there is more than one building – at least two , and often several buildings next to each other.

Because these buildings are all built by the same c ompany, they often look identical. “Identical” (identical) means exactly the same. You can have “identical twins,” two babies born at the same time that look almost exactly alike. I have two brothers who are identical twins. But back to o ur story.

Omid says, “Don’t you have the address?” Lily says “Yes, but all of the complexes in this subdivision look the same and I d on’t see a street number on any of them.” A “subdivision” is an area of land th at is usually divided and developed by a single company. When I say “develope d,” I mean the company that owns the land builds either houses or apartmen t buildings and then sells the houses to people – individual families and people wanting to buy houses – or it owns a set of buildings that have apartments in the m that are rented.

Lily says she doesn’t see a street number on the bu ildings. A “street number” is the numerical part of an address, the numbered part  of an address. So, if the address were 1257 Main Street, the street number wo uld be 1-2-5-7 (1257). Notice we don’t say “one thousand two hundred and f ifty-seven.” We just say either the individual numbers (1-2-5-7) or we group  them in groups of two or three. So, 12-57.

Omid says, “Are you sure you’re looking for a block  of apartments?” A “block” (block) is normally, when we’re talking about a tow n or city, a square or rectangular area that is surrounded by four streets . Some of these apartment complexes are so big that they take up an entire bl ock. Omid says that perhaps the apartment is not in a block of apartments.

“Maybe it’s a mixed-use building like that one over  there,” he says. “Mixed-use” is a building that has both businesses and apartments or condominiums in it. In big cities, it’s often the case that, especially in the  downtown or central area of town, a building will be built where the first and perhap s second floors of the building are businesses – stores, offices – and the upper st ories, the upper levels of the building, are condominiums or apartments. This is c alled a “mixed-use building.”

But Lily says, “I’m pretty sure,” meaning she’s fai rly certain that she’s looking for a block of apartments. She says, “At least I know it’s a high-rise building and the

apartment is on the eighth floor. That mixed-use bu ilding is only three stories high.” A “high-rise (rise) building” is a very tall  building. If it’s a business building and it’s really tall, we might call it a “skyscrape r.”

A “high-rise” could be a tall apartment building. U sually the building is several floors tall. A “floor” is the same as a level. The word “story” is also used to mean level or floor when we’re talking about a building.  Lily says that the apartment she’s looking for is “on the eighth floor.” Now, in  the United States, the ground level – the level that you walk into from the stree t – is considered the first floor. In other countries, the first floor is actually the fl oor that’s one above the ground floor.

That’s why Americans sometimes get confused when th ey go to Europe, for example, and someone says it’s on the first floor, but the floor is not the one that’s on the ground. It’s the one that’s above the  one on the ground. Americans would call that the second floor. We don’t have a f loor zero; we just have a first, second, third, fourth, and so on floor. The mixed-u se building that Omid is pointing out to Lily is a three-story-high building . Lily says the building “is only three stories high.” That means it’s three levels, three floors, high.

Omid says, “Oh, then it’s not a duplex or a triplex , like those over there.” A “duplex” (duplex) is a building with two apartments , usually one on the first floor and one on the second floor. Each apartment has its  own entrance, there’s separate living areas, and they’re rented separatel y. A triplex (you can probably guess from the prefix “tri-”) is a building with th ree apartments. We also sometimes use the word “fourplex” for a building wi th four apartments. Lily says, “No, it’s not a duplex or a triplex.”

She says, “I’d better call” – I ought to, I should call – “the rental agent and get directions.” Omid says, “Hey, look over there. I se e a couple of residents of that building walking out. Let’s ask them.” A “resident”  is a person who lives in a particular area or a particular building. I am a re sident of Los Angeles. That’s where I live. That’s my permanent home.

Omid says that there are a couple of residents walk ing out of one of the buildings, and so perhaps he and Lily should go ove r and ask them. Omid goes over and says, “Excuse me.” “Excuse me” – that’s ho w we get someone’s attention in a polite way. “Oh, they didn’t hear me ,” Omid says. Lily says, “I’ll just make the call,” meaning I’ll just call the rental a gent.

Omid says, “Well, you can be sure of one thing if y ou move into one of these complexes.” Lily says, “What?” Omid says, “The bill  collectors will never be able

to find you.” Omid is making a joke here. He’s sayi ng that it’s so difficult to find these buildings that no one would be able to find t hem, even people who are looking for you, such as bill collectors.

What is a “bill collector?” A bill collector is a p erson who goes and finds people who haven’t paid their bills – money they owe to a company – and gets them to pay them. If, for example, you buy a telephone, and  you use the telephone but then you don’t pay for the minutes that you use, the telephone company will try to find you and get you to pay for them. They will usu ally hire another company – a collection agency – that will go and try to find yo u and call you and go to your house to get the money from you. That is a bill col lector.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
