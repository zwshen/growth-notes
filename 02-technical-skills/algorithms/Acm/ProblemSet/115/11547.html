><FONT size="+1">Last month Alice nonchalantly entered her name in a draw for a Tapmaster 4000. Upon checking her mail today, she found a letter that read: </P
><P 

>&ldquo;Congratulations, Alice! You have won a Tapmaster 4000. To claim your prize, you must answer the following skill testing question.&rdquo; </P
><P 

>Alice&rsquo;s initial feelings of surprised joy turned quickly to those of dismay. Her lifetime record for skill testing questions is an abysmal 3 right and 42 wrong. </P
><P 

>Mad Skills, the leading skill testing question development company, was hired to provide skill testing questions for this particular Tapmaster 4000 draw. They decided to create a different skill testing question to each winner so that the winners could not collaborate to answer the question. </P
><P 

>Can you help Alice win the Tapmaster 4000 by solving the skill testing question? </P
><P 

><FONT size="+2" color="#258234">Program Input </P
><P 

><FONT size="+1" color="#000000">The input begins with <I>t </I>(1 &le; <I>t </I>&le; 100), the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer <I>n </I>(-1000 &le; <I>n </I>&le; 1000) on a line by itself. This <I>n</I> should be substituted into the skill testing question below. </P
><P 

><FONT size="+2" color="#258234">Program Output </P
><P 

><FONT size="+1" color="#000000">For each test case, output the answer to the following skill testing question on a line by itself: &ldquo;Multiply <I>n</I> by 567, then divide the result by 9, then add 7492, then multiply by 235, then divide by 47, then subtract 498. What is the digit in the tens column?&rdquo; </P
