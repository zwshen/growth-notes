I was just in this neck of the woods and thought I would pay you a visit.  Lorraine:  Sure you were.  Of course, I’m glad to see you, but this is just a little out of the blue.  Terrance:  What do you mean?  Lorraine:  I haven’t seen you in over five months, and you just happened to be in the neighborhood?  Terrance:  Well, I wasn’t exactly in the neighborhood, but I wanted to see my favorite sister.  Lorraine:  Your only sister.  Okay, out with it.  What are you doing here?

The performers did a passable job.  It was nothing to write home about.  Claudia:  You are so jaded.  That performance was genius.  It took my breath away.  Javier:  I thought the first number was okay, and none of the dancers embarrassed themselves, but that’s all I can say about it.    Claudia:  I’m sure they’d thank you for that faint praise.  Me?  I’ve never seen anything better.  Javier:  Now how can you say that?  That’s just over the top.    Claudia:  If I can’t be effusive, who can?  How many times will we see our granddaughter in a school play?  Javier:  She’s seven years old and she played a tomato!

It’s an article about our company.  Alex:  Let me see that.  This is outrageous!  How can anybody print such lies?  We’re not on the verge of going under.  How did they get a hold of so much misleading and outright wrong information?  Paige:  What I’m irate about is what it says about you, as the owner.  The article is full of innuendos about your background.  It’s nothing short of character assassination.  We’ll sue the paper for defamation of character.  Alex:  I’m not worried about my personal reputation.  I’m more concerned about the company’s image.  I’m going down to that paper and making them print a retraction. # Talking About Astronomy

However, I was having some trouble figuring out the bus schedule.  Louisa:  Excuse me, could you help me read this bus schedule?  Curt:  I can try.  Where do you want to go?  Louisa:  I want to go downtown, but I’m not sure which bus to take.  Curt:  Let me see that bus schedule.  Here’s a listing of the route numbers on the back of this schedule.  Look for a bus that goes downtown.  Louisa:  Oh, I see.  That’s great.  Tomorrow, I want to arrive at the Podcast Museum at 10 a.m. when it opens.  Which bus will I have to take?  Curt:  Let me look at this bus schedule.  That’s simple.  All you have to do is find the stop closest to the museum, then look down the column to find the arrival time of 10 a.m. or before, and work backwards to see what time that bus passes the stop at your starting point.

Gisele:  Jeanine…Jeanine…Is that the woman you’ve been going out with?  Nobu:  Yeah, it’s her.  I tried to let her down easy, but she’s not taking the hint.    Gisele:  I see.  That’s why you’ve been screening calls.  Why don’t you just talk to her and tell her that you don’t think you’re right for each other, take the direct approach?  Nobu:  I figure if I don’t take her calls for a few more days, she’ll get the message.  Gisele:  Are you sure?  There are 14 new voicemail messages.  How many of those do you think are from Jeanine?  Nobu:  All of them.  I let calls go to voicemail if I see her phone number on caller ID.  I guess I should listen to those messages – sooner or later. # Formatting Text

This episode is called “Formatting Text.”  It’s a dialogu e between Chad and Pamela that is going to be using a lot of vocabulary tha t you might need when talking about preparing a formal document on a word processing program such as Microsoft Word.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chad:  Okay, this report is finally finished.

Pamela:  Oh, not quite.  I’m still working on the for matting.

Chad:  We used the standard formatting for this type of  report.  I don’t think we should play around with the text.

Pamela:  Standard is boring.  I want our report to b e special.  I’m putting a nice border on the cover, adding some shading, and centering some of the text.

Chad:  No, I really think that’s a bad idea.  All of t he text should be flush left, and nobody else puts shading in their reports.  It cuts down on readability.

Pamela:  Readability is secondary to presentation.  Look, I’m just putting some of the titles in caps and underlining them, adding some bu llets, and putting some of the important sections in bold or italics.  This will al l make each page look more professional.

Chad:  I don’t think it’s going to have your intended e ffect.

 Pamela:  Really?

Chad:  Yes, instead of thinking we’re being professional , they’ll think we’ve gone off our rocker.

Pamela:  Don’t be so stodgy.  Hey, I think adding some cli p art would really jazz things up, don’t you?

Chad:  Oh, God!

[end of dialogue]

Chad begins our dialogue by saying to Pamela, “Okay, this report is finished.”  A “report” is a document that summarizes some information about a particular topic, often as a result of research on that topic.  Pame la says, “Oh, not quite (meaning no, it isn’t finished yet – not quite).  I’m  still working on the formatting.” The “formatting” is the ways that words are printed or displayed in electronic documents; it’s the visible style of the words, how they appear on the page. Chad says, “We used the standard formatting for this type of report.”  “Standard” in many business uses typically means the basic, ordinary, norm al, expected type of whatever it is you’re talking about.  So, the “ standard formatting” would be the formatting that their company always uses for these kinds of reports.  Chad says, “I don’t think we should play around with the text .”  “To play around” is a phrasal verb which here means to change without really ne eding to change. “Play around” can often just mean to look at something  closely to try different options.  In this case, it’s used somewhat as a negative to mean that it’s a waste of time.  The “text” are the written words, what you have actually written.

Pamela says, “Standard is boring.”  Standard formatting , she means, is boring; it’s not interesting.  She says, “I want our report to be special (to be different). I’m putting a nice border on the cover, adding some shad ing, and centering some of the text.”  A “border” is a line or some sort of ar tistic design that goes around text or other images, usually it is rectangular in shape.  It’s like a big box that goes around everything else, often a black line.  “Shadi ng” is gray area behind the text – behind the writing or behind objects.  It’s often used for emphasis.  You might make a certain sentence gray, meaning that the ba ckground is gray but the actual type – the actual text is still in black in order to emphasize a particular sentence.  Usually in black and white documents shading is w hat we call the color between black and white, which is gray.  “Shading” has a couple of other meanings however, and those can be found only in our Lea rning Guide.  “To center” (center) means to put the text on the page so th at each sentence is in the

 middle of the page or the middle of the area.  When  you center your text there isn’t a line – a vertical line at the left or right si des of the paragraph.  The paragraph is oddly shaped; each side, both the left and  the right side are going to be slightly different because the sentences are in the mid dle of the page. Sometimes we use this for poetry or perhaps for special i nvitations.  That’s to center.

Well, Pamela wants to put a nice border on the cover, a dd some shading, and center some of the text.  Chad says, “No, I think that’s a  bad idea,” and Pamela says, “Chad, I think you’re ugly!”  No, she doesn’t say that !  Chad continues, “All of the text should be flush left, and nobody else puts sh ading in the reports.”  To be “flush left” means to be immediately next to the lef t hand side of the page. Basically it means that all of the sentences begin on the same vertical line on the left side of the page.  To be “flush right” means that  all of the sentences are on a vertical line on the right side of the page.  Finally, the third possibility, other than centering, is to be justified.  Text that is “justified”  (justified) is text that has two lines, one on the left, one on the right, and all of  the sentences reach those two lines.  So, there are two straight lines of text on the  left and the right if you look at the page.  Most books are written either flush left or justified; you don’t often see a long document flush right or centered.

Chad thinks all the text should be flush left, and says th at to put shading in the report cuts down on readability.  “To cut down on (somet hing)” is a phrasal verb meaning it reduces, it lessens, it makes it less.  In th is case, it makes it less readable because it cuts down on readability.  “Readabi lity” is how easy it is to read something, both because of the words – the grammar , the vocabulary – as well as the way they appear on the page.  You want thi ngs to be very readable in terms of the appearance of the text.

Pamela says, “Readability is secondary to presentation.”  “Secondary” means it is not as important as, or is second most important, but t he most important is presentation.  “Presentation” is the way that you show so mething or share something with other people.  “Presentation” is often also used to mean a speech or a talk in front of a group of people.  Here, howe ver, it mean simply the way that something looks when you give it to someone else.

Pamela says, “Look (meaning I want you to listen to me) , I’m just putting some of the titles in caps and underlining them, adding some bu llets, and putting some of the important sections in bold or italics.”  Several for matting terms there, let’s start with “caps” (caps).  “Caps” refers to – or is short for capital letters.  We sometimes call these upper-case letters; they are the larg e form of the letter.

 You also have lower-case letters; these are smaller form s of the letters.  So in English, sentences always begin with a capital letter.  the first letter, in other words, is in caps – that is, a capital letter.  To put a n entire word in caps would mean to capitalize the entire word, all of the lette rs are upper case.  “To underline” means to put a usually black horizontal line underneath, or below a sentence.  A “bullet” (bullet) in formatting is a small  mark, often a round circle that is used at the beginning of each item in a list.  You o ften will see what are called “bullet points.”  Bullet points are the same as bullet s; they are usually small white or black circles that go in front of a list of things – e ach item, each thing on that list.  “Bullet” has other meanings in English as well,  and those can be found in the Learning Guide.  If you don’t know them, you might wa nt to learn them because it could save your life!  “Bold” (bold) are letters that ar e thicker and darker than the other letters around them, usually we use this to emphasi ze a particular word, to make it, we would say, “stand out,” to make it noticeabl e.  Finally, Pamela talks about italics.  “Italics” is when the letters are printe d at an angle so that it looks more like handwriting.  Again, this is used for emphasis.

So Pamela says that she’s going to put some of the titles in caps and underline them, she’s going to add some bullets or some bullet p oints, and she’s going to put some of the important sections in bold or italics.  “ This will all make each page more professional,” she says.  Chad says, “I don’t thi nk it’s going to have your intended effect.”  The “intended effect” is the re sult that you want to achieve; is what you plan to do or hope to have happen as a resu lt of your actions.  If you walk up to a beautiful woman in a bar and you say to h er, “Do you come here often?” the intended effect is for her to start a conver sation with you.  However, the more probable effect is for her to ignore you or turn the other way.  Well, at least that’s what always used to happen to me!

Chad doesn’t think Pamela’s changes are good ones.  Pam ela says, “Really?” Chad replies, “Yes, instead of thinking we’re being pro fessional, they’ll think we’ve gone off our rocker.”  The expression “to go off yo ur rocker” (rocker), or “to be off your rocker” means to be crazy, to not be able to  think clearly or rationally, to be nuts.  A “rocker” is a word for a “rocking chair, ” which is a chair that has instead of regular legs two semi-circles, almost like part s of a circle, that you can move the chair back and forth easily.  This is sometimes a ki nd of chair we associate in the United States with old people – with e lderly people, who it is sometimes thought don’t always think rationally because the y’re old and their brains are old.  This is certainly true of my old brain!  Well, that’s the association then, the rocker is an old person who may be a little cr azy.  I suppose “to be off your rocker” means that you are up and out of your rockin g chair and causing problems somewhere else.

 In any case, Pamela says to Chad, “Don’t be so stodgy (stodg y).”  “To be stodgy” means to be very old-fashioned, to think the way people  thought 50 years ago or 100 years ago.  It can also mean to be unwilling or u nable to accept new ideas, new ways of doing things.  Pamela says, “Hey, I think ad ding some clip art would really jazz things up, don’t you?”  “Clip (clip) art” (t wo words) refers to small electronic drawings or other images that you can put in electronic documents, like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, that some people thi nk will make the presentation, the way it looks, more interesting.  When personal computers first started to become popular in the 80s and 90s it was very common to see people putting clip art in all sorts of things, including on we b pages.  I think that has become less popular, thankfully, now.

Pamela wants to put some clip art in order to jazz thing s up.  “To jazz (something) up” means to make it more exciting, to make i t more interesting. Pamela says, “I think adding some clip art would really ja zz things up, don’t you?” Chad doesn’t agree, he simply says, “Oh, God!” meaning he  doesn’t agree at all.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Chad:  Okay, this report is finally finished.

Pamela:  Oh, not quite.  I’m still working on the for matting.

Chad:  We used the standard formatting for this type of  report.  I don’t think we should play around with the text.

Pamela:  Standard is boring.  I want our report to b e special.  I’m putting a nice border on the cover, adding some shading, and centering some of the text.

Chad:  No, I really think that’s a bad idea.  All of t he text should be flush left, and nobody else puts shading in their reports.  It cuts down on readability.

Pamela:  Readability is secondary to presentation.  Look, I’m just putting some of the titles in caps and underlining them, adding some bu llets, and putting some of the important sections in bold or italics.  This will al l make each page look more professional.

Chad:  I don’t think it’s going to have your intended e ffect.

 Pamela:  Really?

Chad:  Yes, instead of thinking we’re being professional , they’ll think we’ve gone off our rocker.

Pamela:  Don’t be so stodgy.  Hey, I think adding some cli p art would really jazz things up, don’t you?

Chad:  Oh, God!

This episode is called “Types of Cars and Vehicles.”  It’s a dialogue between Robert and Mary, where we’re going to hear a lot of vocabulary related to types, or kinds, of cars.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Robert:  Hi, I’m Robert.  What are you in the market for today?

Mary:  I want to buy a new car, but I’m not sure what I  want.

Robert:  Well, you’ve come to the right place.  We have a very large selection of cars and trucks – just about any type of vehicle you can think of.  Why don’t I show you around?

Mary:  Okay, that would be great.

Robert:  Over here, we have some nice compacts and mid-si ze cars.  We have two-door or four-door sedans, coupes, and hatchbacks.  We e ven have this beautiful convertible sports car.  What do you think?

Mary:  It’s very nice, but I want something a little big ger for my family.

Robert:  Okay, no sweat.  Walk this way and you’ll see o ur station wagons, minivans, and SUVs.  These seat anywhere from 6 to 10 pe ople.  We even have pickups.

Mary:  I’m not sure if any of these will fit my family?

Robert:  How many children do you have?

 Mary:  Eleven.

Robert:  Eleven?  In that case, you might want to buy tw o!

[end of dialogue]

The scene of this dialogue is a “car dealership,” a place where they sell new cars.  The salesperson is named Robert, and Robert begins our dialogue by saying, “Hi, I’m Robert.  What are you in the market for today?”  “To be in the market for (something)” means to be shopping for somet hing, to be considering a certain kind of something that is available for sale; you’ re deciding which one you’re going to buy.  You might say, “I’m in the market for a new phone.”  I really need a new phone.  I wish the listeners of ESL Podcast w ould give me an iPhone and an iPad.  That’s what I’m in the market for; I’m going to buy them.  Of course, if someone gave them to me, I would not say no!

Well, Mary is in the market for buying a new car, or sim ply in the market for a new car.  She says, “I want to buy a new car, but I’m no t sure what I want.” Robert says, “Well, you’ve come to the right place (you ar e in the right place). We have a very large selection of cars and trucks – just abou t any type of vehicle you can think of.”  A “truck” is a large vehicle used to ca rry things, not just carry people.  Usually there is an open area in the back of the vehicle to put large objects.  The expression “just about” means almost or appro ximately.  “What time is it?”  “It’s just about noon.”  Or, you could say, “We  have just about every kind of dessert here.  Cakes, pies, cookies, ice cream, candy, and so forth.”  So, “just about” is almost or approximately, but there are some ot her meanings you can find in our Learning Guide for these words.

Robert says they have just about any type of vehicle you can t hink of.  “Vehicle” (vehicle) is any large machine with an engine that is used  to carry people or things from one place to another.  It could be a car; i t could be a truck; it could be a motorcycle, anything that has a motor – an engine – th at is used to move people from one place to another.  Robert says, “Why do n’t I show you around?” “Why don’t” here means I think it is a good idea.  “To  show (someone) around” is a phrasal verb meaning to give you a tour of an area or to show you what, in this case, the store has for sale.

Mary says, “Okay, that would be great,” meaning yes.  Rober t says, “Over here, we have some nice compacts and mid-size cars.”  A “compact car”  is a very small car, one of the smallest you can find.  A “mid-size (mid-size) car” is a

 medium-sized car – not too small, not too big, somewhere  in the middle.  Robert says, “We have two-door or four-door sedans, coupes, and ha tchbacks.”  These are three kinds of cars.  A “sedan” (sedan) is usually a ca r with four doors – two in front, two in back – that has room for at least four  people.  A “coupe” (coupe) is a small car with only two doors, and is usually what we would call a “sports car.” It’s a car that goes fast, that looks nice, that will allo w you to attract a lot of beautiful women – well, certain kinds of women!  A “h atchback” (hatchback – one word) is a car that has either two or four doors, but  in the back it has a very large door that opens up, and usually you can put large items in the back of this kind of car.  Often the seats in the back will go down – will f old down so you have more room.  I have a hatchback car; there are four doors and t hen there is a fifth door, a large door that is where you would normally find the  trunk of the car – the back storage part of the car, and that is used just like a t runk but it’s much bigger than a trunk.  So, we have sedans, coupes, and hatchbacks.  Robe rt says, “We even have this beautiful convertible sports car.”  A “converti ble car” is one where the roof – the top of the car folds down or can be removed so that you don’t have anything above you, there’s no roof.  A sports car, as I me ntioned earlier, is often a small car, usually expensive, that can go very fast, so you can  attract the attention of police officers!

Robert shows all these cars to Mary and says, “What do you think?”  What do you think of these cars?  Mary says, “It’s very nice, but I want  something bigger for my family.”  Robert says, “Okay, no sweat.”  “No sweat ” (sweat) means no problem.  It’s an informal phrase we use to let someon e else know that what they are concerned about or what they are worried about is n ot a problem; you have a solution for your problem.

“No sweat,” he says, “Walk this way (come with me) and you’l l see our station wagons, minivans, and SUVs.”  A “station wagon” is a larg e car that has a lot of storage space in the back.  It’s long more than it is tal l.  So, it is a long car, usually four doors, but there is also a hatchback-like door in the back, but there’s a lot more space.  These were very popular in the 60s and  the 70s and the 80s. They’ve become less popular now because there are some oth er kinds of large vehicles that are used such as minivans and SUVs, which we’ll  explain in a moment.  But station wagons were very popular.  My fathe r always drove a station wagon until he was at least in his 70s.  Part of the reason was that he had a big family, and so he needed all of that room.  In fact, I bought his old station wagon and drove it when I was in graduate school.  Tha t really attracted the beautiful women!  “Minivans” are large vehicles that ha ve a lot of room for passengers – for people.  Typically they’ll have seven or e ight seats.  It’s long, but much taller than a station wagon.  A “SUV” is a spo rts utility vehicle.  This is a

 large car, both tall and long, and very heavy.  It was or iginally designed to travel on uneven surfaces, places like the desert or in the countr y where are no roads. But in fact, most people that own these SUVs don’t use them anywhere outside of the regular roads and highways.  They’re very popula r here in Los Angeles and in many other cities.  They are definitely not the ch eapest cars you can buy.

Getting back to the dialogue, Robert says, “These seat anyw here from 6 to 10 people.”  The expression “to seat” (seat) as a verb means i t has enough seats for that many people.  So for example, a stadium – a baseb all stadium that has 55,000 seats would be described as a stadium that seats 55 ,000.  Robert says that these station wagons, minivans, and SUVs seat anywhere  from 6 to 10 people.  The expression “anywhere from…(one number to another – anywhere from 5 to 50)” is simply used to express a range of somethi ng, to give the minimum and the maximum – anywhere from X to Y.  Robe rt also says that they have pickups (pickups – one word).  A “pickup,” or sometimes it’s called a “pickup truck” is a small truck with a large open area in  the back that has low sides.  It’s very similar to other kinds of trucks, except the p ickup truck always, or almost always doesn’t have a cover on the back part where yo u put large objects, the flat part in the back of the vehicle.

Mary says, “I’m not sure if any of these will fit my family? ” meaning will be good enough or big enough.  Robert says, “How many children d o you have?”  Mary says, “Eleven.”  Robert says, “Eleven?  In that case (in that  situation), you might want to buy two (two cars or two trucks or two station wa gons)!”  Of course, some of you know I am the youngest of 11 children, so perh aps this dialogue was written for me – after all, my mother’s name is Mar y!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Robert:  Hi, I’m Robert.  What are you in the market for today?

Mary:  I want to buy a new car, but I’m not sure what I  want.

Robert:  Well, you’ve come to the right place.  We have a very large selection of cars and trucks – just about any type of vehicle you can think of.  Why don’t I show you around?

Mary:  Okay, that would be great.

 Robert:  Over here, we have some nice compacts and mid-si ze cars.  We have two-door or four-door sedans, coupes, and hatchbacks.  We e ven have this beautiful convertible sports car.  What do you think?

Mary:  It’s very nice, but I want something a little big ger for my family.

Robert:  Okay, no sweat.  Walk this way and you’ll see o ur station wagons, minivans, and SUVs.  These seat anywhere from 6 to 10 pe ople.  We even have pickups.

Mary:  I’m not sure if any of these will fit my family?

Robert:  How many children do you have?

Mary:  Eleven.

Robert:  Eleven?  In that case, you might want to buy tw o!

# Preparing to Travel

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 10: Preparing to Travel.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 610.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Blue skies, 72 deg rees, another beautiful day in L.A.

This episode is called “Preparing to Travel.”  It’s a dia logue between Shannon and Ignacio using a lot of vocabulary that you would ne ed before you go on a trip.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Shannon:  It looks like you’re ready for your trip.  You must be psyched.

Ignacio:  Yeah, I am.  I’m almost ready.  I’ve gone to the post office and filled out a form so they’ll hold my mail while I’m gone.

Shannon:  I could pick up your mail for you.

Ignacio:  Thanks, but it’ll just be easier this way.  I’ve also called the newspaper office to have my newspaper delivery suspended.  Tomorrow  I’ll arrange for my bank to automatically pay my bills so I won’t have my utili ties cut off or accrue any late fees.

Shannon:  I could pay your bills for you.  I don’t min d.

Ignacio:  It’s nice of you to offer, but I’ve got it cover ed.  This morning, I took my plants over to my neighbor’s house.  He agreed to water  them for me while I’m gone.

Shannon:  I could have come over and watered your plan ts.  That wouldn’t have been a problem at all.

 Ignacio:  Thanks for being willing to do that.  As alwa ys, you’re so helpful.

Shannon:  Oh, I try my best…

Ignacio:  I was wondering if I could ask just one favor from you.

Shannon:  Of course you can.  Just name it!

Ignacio:  You know my dog, Rex…

Shannon:  Oh, no…

Ignacio:  I could board him at a kennel, but he’s had  bad luck at kennels.  Could you look after him while I’m gone?

Shannon:  No way!

Ignacio:  Why?

Shannon:  Why don’t you ask the people who worked at tho se kennels where Rex has been?  I’m willing to pitch in, but I’m no sucker !

[end of dialogue]

Shannon begins the dialogue by saying, “It looks like you’r e ready for your trip. You must be psyched.”  “To be psyched” (psyched) means to be very excited about something.  It’s a very informal expression; it mean s you are mentally prepared for something, something that you want to d o, that you are looking forward to do.

Ignacio says, “Yeah, I am.  I’m almost ready (I’m nearly ready, not quite).  I’ve gone to the post office and filled out a form (a piece  of paper) so they’ll hold my mail while I’m gone.”  “To hold the mail,” or “hold  your mail” means not to have your mail delivered to your house for a specific period o f time.  In other words, the post office, the local building where the mail is t aken care of, they will keep your mail at the post office while you are on vacation.  The reason people do this is because they don’t want all this mail coming to their house and people would realize they weren’t there and therefore they might tr y to steal something.  So, it’s very common for people to hold their mail when they go on a long vacation, let’s say a week or more.  That’s what Ignacio is doing.

 Shannon says, “I could pick up your mail for you (I could d rive to your house every day or every other day – every second day, and get it f or you).”  Ignacio says, “Thanks, but it’ll just be easier this way.  I’ve also ca lled the newspaper office to have my newspaper delivery suspended.”  “To susp end (something)” means to temporarily – for a short time – stop doing som ething.  You plan on doing it again in the future, but for right now you  don’t want it done.  In this case, Ignacio is suspending his newspaper delivery, where they com e every morning and bring a newspaper to your house.  I have my newspap er delivered every morning.  Well, Ignacio, because he’s going to be gone,  doesn’t want a bunch of newspapers sitting outside his house, which is, again, som ething that if you were a thief – if you were someone who likes to rob or stea l things from houses, you would see that and think the person is not at home and you can break into their house.  It’s the same idea as we mentioned about the ma il.  “Suspend” has a couple of different meanings in English; you can find those in this episode’s Learning Guide.

Ignacio says, “Tomorrow I’ll arrange for my bank (I will call my bank and tell them) to automatically pay my bills so I won’t have my uti lities cut off or accrue any late fees.”  So, Ignacio is calling his bank and tell ing them to automatically pay his bills.  Many banks now, on their websites, allow you  to pay your bills electronically.  And, you can even have it done automatical ly, so you don’t even have to go into the website, they will automatically pay the bill for you, and that’s what Ignacio wants.  He’s especially concerned about his ut ilities.  A “utility” (utility) is a service that is provided by typically the gover nment to you.  We are referring to your water, your gas, your electricity; the se are all things that the government – the local government takes care of, but of co urse, you have to pay for it.  Collectively – that is, as a group – we call th ese utilities.  If you are renting an apartment sometimes it will include utilities, mean ing it would be part of your rent, you don’t have to pay extra.  Sometimes it doesn’t.   Ignacio is concerned that they will cut off his utilities.  “To cut off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop providing a service, usually because you haven’t paid  for it.  So if you don’t pay your phone bill, the phone company will cut of f your service; you will no longer be able to use it.  He’s also concerned about acc ruing late fees.  “To accrue” (accrue) means to have something add up over time,  for something to increase or become larger.  Usually we use this verb when w e are talking about something financial – something related to money.  If you don’t pay your utilities, the utility company may charge you an extra fee – an extra amount of money for being late.  That’s what a late fee is.  Ignacio doesn’ t want to have a bunch of late fees he has to pay, so that’s why he wants his bills pa id automatically.

 Shannon, again, offers to help.  She says, “I could pa y your bills for you.  I don’t mind,” meaning it’s no problem for me.  Ignacio says, “I t’s nice of you to offer, but I’ve got it covered.”  “To have something covered,” or “t o have got something covered” is an informal way of saying that you have alread y fixed the problem or you have taken care of the problem; you have everything under control, we might also say.  Ignacio says, “This morning, I took my plants over to my neighbor’s house,” his flowers perhaps.  Ignacio says the neighbor agr eed to water them for me while I’m gone.  “To water,” here, means to give t he plants water so that they don’t die.  This is the problem I think I have; when I  get a plant I forget to water it and it dies.  I don’t know why the plant doesn’t ask me for the water – tell me it’s thirsty.  I just don’t understand!

Anyway, back to the episode.  Shannon says, “I could have come  over and watered your plants (I could have come over if you had a sked me)…”  This is what we call a conditional clause.  “That wouldn’t have been a problem at all.” Again, there’s an idea of if you do something then I w ould do something else. But Shannon, of course, was not asked by Ignacio, and tha t’s why she’s using the conditional form.

Ignacio says, “Thanks for being willing to do that.  As al ways, you’re so helpful.” Shannon says, “Oh, I try my best (I do my best)…”  Ignacio then says, “I was wondering if I could ask just one favor from you (ask you to  do one thing).” Shannon says, “Of course you can.  Just name it!”  When som eone says, “name it” they mean you are willing to do whatever the other  person wants or needs.  It’s an informal phrase; it’s saying I will do whatever you w ant me to do.

Ignacio says, “You know my dog, Rex…”  Rex is the name of the dog.  Shannon says, “Oh, no…”  Ignacio says, “I could board him at a kennel , but he’s had bad luck at kennels.”  A “kennel” is a place where you can leave your dog or your cat or other small pets while you are traveling.  It’s like a  hotel for animals.  “To board” means, in this case, to pay for the animal to be  at the kennel.  Ignacio says, “Could you look after him while I’m gone?”  “To lo ok after (someone)” means to take care of someone, to keep someone safe or o ut of trouble: “My mother is sick, I need to go to her house to look after her.”

Shannon, however, says, “No way!” meaning absolutely not,  I will not look after your dog.  Ignacio says, “Why?”  Shannon says, “Why don’t y ou ask the people who worked at those kennels where Rex has been?”  In oth er words, if Rex had a problem at the kennel it’s probably because he’s not a  good dog.  Shannon says, “I’m willing to pitch in, but I’m no sucker!”  “To p itch (pitch) in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to help someone do something, to assist with something,

 typically doing a small part of a larger project or job .  If you have a big project at work the boss may ask everyone to pitch in – every one to hel p, or he may use another phrasal verb: “to help out.”

Shannon says she is willing to pitch in, but she’s no sucker – she’s not a sucker (sucker).  A “sucker” is a person who is easily fooled, who is easily tricked.  We might also say a “gullible” person.  In Shakespeare’s pla y Othello , Othello was sort of a sucker.  He was someone who believed everything t hat he was told. Well, this expression is very informal, but it means same th ing: someone who believes what he or she is told and is easily fooled.  the word is sometimes used as an insult: “See you later sucker!”  You shouldn’t say th at typically, however, it’s kind of a mean thing and someone might decide to p ut their fist into your face if you say that!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Shannon:  It looks like you’re ready for your trip.  You must be psyched.

Ignacio:  Yeah, I am.  I’m almost ready.  I’ve gone to the post office and filled out a form so they’ll hold my mail while I’m gone.

Shannon:  I could pick up your mail for you.

Ignacio:  Thanks, but it’ll just be easier this way.  I’ve also called the newspaper office to have my newspaper delivery suspended.  Tomorrow  I’ll arrange for my bank to automatically pay my bills so I won’t have my utili ties cut off or accrue any late fees.

Shannon:  I could pay your bills for you.  I don’t min d.

Ignacio:  It’s nice of you to offer, but I’ve got it cover ed.  This morning, I took my plants over to my neighbor’s house.  He agreed to water  them for me while I’m gone.

# Having an Overbearing Father

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 11: Having an Overbearing Father.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 611.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Having an Overbearing Father.”  S omeone who is “overbearing” is very controlling.  This is a dialogue be tween a father and his daughter, and you’re going to see how the father trie s to control his daughter.  He thinks it’s normal, she thinks it’s too much.  Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Dad:  Where are you going?

Eva:  Out.

Dad:  Out where?

Eva:  Dad, I’m nearly a grown woman.  You don’t need be so overbearing.  You give me the third degree every time I leave the house.

Dad:  As long as you live under my roof, you’ll live by my rules.  Now, where are you going?

Eva:  I’m going over to Damien’s house to hang out.  I’ ll be home before curfew.

Dad:  I don’t like that guy, Damien.  He’s not good en ough for you.  He’s a troublemaker.  Mark my words: That kid is going nowhere fast.  Is this a date?

Eva:  No, Dad, we’re just going to watch a movie.

Dad:  Alone?  With no supervision?  What is this world co ming to?

 Eva:  Dad, we’re not kids anymore.  We’re both 17.

Dad:  That’s exactly the right age to get into the most trouble.

Eva:  What are you doing?

Dad:  I’m putting on my coat.

Eva:  Why?

Dad:  You and Damien need a chaperon.

Eva:  No way, Dad!  I’m not going over to Damien’s wit h you tagging along as our chaperon.  That would be humiliating.

Dad:  Good, then you’ll stay home.  So, what movie shou ld we watch tonight?

Eva:  Huh!

[end of dialogue]

The dialogue begins with the father saying, “Where are  you going?”  Eva says, “Out.”  This is a typical thing that a teenager or young  adult might say; they don’t want to tell the father exactly where they’re going so they say, “Oh, I’m just going out,” meaning I’m leaving the house, but you don’t tel l them where you’re going. So, the father says, “Out where?”  Eva says, “Dad, I’m nea rly (I’m almost) a grown woman.”  “Grown,” here, means an adult, no lon ger a child.  We might also say “grown up.”  She’s a grown woman.  “Grown,” ho wever, has even more meanings in English; those can be found in our Learning  Guide.

Eva says to her father, “You don’t need be so overbearing .”  “Overbearing” is when you are very controlling, you have very strong opinion s about things, you try to control what other people do.  You could be an overbearing husband, an overbearing wife, an overbearing mother-in-law; all o f these are possible – not in my case, of course!

Well, Eva says, “You don’t need to be so overbearing (Da d).  You give me the third degree every time I leave the house.”  “To give (so meone) the third degree” (degree) means to ask someone many questions, often about things that the person doesn’t want to tell you.  So if you say, “Oh, I’m  going out,” and someone

 says to you, “Where are you going?” and you say, “I’m goin g to the store,” and they say “Which store?” and you say, “I’m going to the gro cery store,” and they say “What are you going to buy there?”  They keep asking you  more and more questions; that’s to give someone the third degree.  Yo u might wonder why we use this expression: “the third degree,” you might not wo nder.  But if you do wonder, I’ll tell you.  “Degree” is sometimes used in English as a way of classifying something at different levels.  If you accidental ly put your hand in fire and burn it you might get a first degree burn, if it ’s more serious a second degree burn, and if it’s really bad a third degree burn.  We ll, there was an organization – there still is – called the Masons, it’s sort of a secret organization for men.  It has been around for many centuries.  Here in the United St ates, in order to become a Mason you have to go through different levels, and the final level is called the Third Degree, and it requires that you be asked a bunch of questions – a lot of questions.  That’s the origin, that’s where the expression  comes from.  In the early 20th century, the police would ask people who they thought committed a crime – who did something against the law – a series of questions.  They would “interrogate” them, which means to ask many questions of so meone you think is a criminal.  That’s what Eva is referring to here.

The father says, “As long as you live under my roof (that is, in my home.  Your ‘roof’ is the top of the house, so if you live in it you  are under the roof), you’ll live by my rules.”  “To live by” is a two-word phrasal verb me aning you will follow certain rules or certain ideas.  We might also say you wi ll “comply (comply) with” these rules.  This is something a parent might say: “if you live under my roof, you live by my rules.”  My parents certainly believe that.

The father says, “Now, where are you going?”  Eva says, “I ’m going over to Damien’s house to hang out.”  Damien is a friend.  “T o hang out” is a phrasal verb meaning to spend time with someone having fun, no t doing anything in particular, maybe talking, watching television, etc.  It’s an informal expression: “to hang out.”  Eva says, “I’ll be home before curfew.”  “Cu rfew” (curfew) is, for children and young adults, the time when you must be back home every night; it’s the latest time that you can be outside of the house .  So if you have a 15- year-old daughter, you might say to her, “Your curfew i s nine p.m.”  That means you must be back here at nine o’clock, that’s your rule.  T he government can also have curfews when there is a lot of violence.  Many cities h ave curfews for those who are under the age of 18.  So even if the parent doesn’t have a curfew, the government will sometimes have a curfew for teenagers.

Eva says she’ll be home before curfew.  Dad says, “I don’t like that guy, Damien. He’s not good enough for you.”  “To be not good enoug h” means that they are

 not as good as someone or something else; we might say the y’re “inferior,” they’re less than your level.  Dad says, “He’s a troublemaker .”  A “troublemaker” (one word) is a person who creates many problems, someone who is always causing trouble: a “troublemaker.”  Dad then says, “Mar k my words.”  The expression “mark my words” is used to indicate to the person  listening to you that you are going to say something important.  Usually, you a re making a prediction; you are making a guess as to what will happen in the fu ture.  You might say, “Mark my words.  Someday, a woman will become President  of the United States.”  You’re making a prediction.  The father is ma king a prediction that Damien is “going nowhere fast.”  This is kind of an odd expression.  “To go nowhere” means that you’re not progressing – you’re not  moving from where you are.  How is it possible to go nowhere fast since you’re n ot moving?  Well, it isn’t. But the expression means that you are a person who will never be successful, or this idea is a losing idea.  So Damien is not going to be successful; he’s a loser.

Dad says, “Is this a date (are you going to Damien’s house on a date)?”  Eva says, “No, Dad, we’re just going to watch a movie.”  The father says, “Alone? With no supervision?”  “Supervision” is when someone is wat ching you to make sure that you are following the rules.  In this case, it  would be an adult such as a parent.  The father says, “What is this world coming to? ”  This is an old expression.  “What is this world coming to?” is used to sho w how upset you are, how angry you are about how things are changing over ti me.  You’re saying that things used to be better in the past, but now everything  is changing; the world is changing for the worse: “What is this world coming to?”

Eva says, “Dad, we’re not kids anymore,” meaning we don’t need supervision. She says, “We’re both 17 (17 years old).”  Dad says, “That’ s exactly the right age to get into the most trouble.”  The father means that  that’s an age where you could do a lot things wrong, and therefore you do need  supervision.  Eva says, “What are you doing?”  The father says, “I’m putting on  my coat (my jacket to go outside).”  Eva says, “Why?”  The father says, “You and Dami en need a chaperon.”  A “chaperon” (chaperon) is a person, usuall y an older person who stays with two other people, usually a man and a woman or a boy and a girl, to make sure that they don’t do anything wrong, especially wh en they are on a romantic date that they don’t do things that the pare nt, in this case, would not want them to do.  A “chaperon” can also be just for a single person, say a young woman who was traveling.  This is not common today, but many years ago a young woman traveling by herself might need a chaperon,  someone such as an older sister, a mother, an aunt that would go with th em to keep them out of trouble.  So, the father is going to be the chaperon for this date.  Do American

 parents still insist their children have chaperons on thei r dates when they are in high school?  I would say probably not.

Eva says, “No way, Dad!  I’m not going over to Damien’s wi th you tagging along as our chaperon.”  “To tag (tag – some would pronounce  it ‘tag,’ but I’m from Minnesota so I pronounce it ‘tag’) along” is a two-wor d phrasal verb meaning to go somewhere with someone, especially when that person d oes not want you to go with them.  Your younger brother may tag along wi th you to go to the movies; you don’t really want your younger brother to go with yo u.  Well, Eva doesn’t want her father to be tagging along on her date.  S he says, “That would be humiliating.”  Something that is “humiliating” is ve ry embarrassing, very uncomfortable, something that makes you feel uncomforta ble, even “ashamed” (ashamed), where you feel bad about what you have done .

Dad says, however, “Good, then you’ll stay home (you won’t leave).  So, what movie should we watch tonight?” the father asks the daug hter since she is now not going to go over to Damien’s house.  The daughter,  of course, is very upset, and she just says, “Huh!”  She’s upset; she doesn’t want to talk to the father anymore.  Was the father being overbearing, unreasonabl e?  Well, I guess that depends on the kind of parent you are.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Dad:  Where are you going?

Eva:  Out.

Dad:  Out where?

Eva:  Dad, I’m nearly a grown woman.  You don’t need be so overbearing.  You give me the third degree every time I leave the house.

Dad:  As long as you live under my roof, you’ll live by my rules.  Now, where are you going?

Eva:  I’m going over to Damien’s house to hang out.  I’ ll be home before curfew.

Dad:  I don’t like that guy, Damien.  He’s not good en ough for you.  He’s a troublemaker.  Mark my words: That kid is going nowhere fast.  Is this a date?

 Eva:  No, Dad, we’re just going to watch a movie.

Dad:  Alone?  With no supervision?  What is this world co ming to?

Eva:  Dad, we’re not kids anymore.  We’re both 17.

Dad:  That’s exactly the right age to get into the most trouble.

Eva:  What are you doing?

Dad:  I’m putting on my coat.

Eva:  Why?

Dad:  You and Damien need a chaperon.

Eva:  No way, Dad!  I’m not going over to Damien’s wit h you tagging along as our chaperon.  That would be humiliating.

Dad:  Good, then you’ll stay home.  So, what movie shou ld we watch tonight?

Eva:  Huh!

This episode is called “Introducing a Speaker.”  It is goi ng to use vocabulary you would hear when someone was going to introduce a presen ter, for example at a conference or at a presentation, usually a formal prese ntation.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please ?

It is my great honor to introduce our guest speaker toda y.  Our speaker is actually a person who needs no introduction, since she is we ll known in our field as one of its great innovators.  Edwina Litton has been  called a revolutionary thinker by those in our field.  That’s because she has stri ved to bring attention to those issues that we believe are so important.

Dr. Litton holds four advanced degrees and has an honor ary doctorate from Harward University.  In her much-anticipated speech today, she will address what she sees as the future of our field.

Without further ado, please join me in welcoming Dr. Edwina Litton.

[end of dialogue]

I begin introducing the speaker by saying, “Ladies and Gen tlemen.”  This is a very formal expression we use for formal events.  If you are  trying to get people’s attention, if you are trying to get people to stop tal king and listen to you in a formal situation, say a business meeting, usually a large  meeting where there are

 many people would say, “Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have  your attention, please?”  Your “attention” is what you are focusing on.  You want them to focus on you.  I continue by saying, once again using some forma l phrases, “It is my great honor to introduce our guest speaker today.”  An “ honor” (honor) is something that makes you feel proud, makes you feel respecte d; it’s a good thing, a pleasurable thing even.  The word “honor” ha s a couple of meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.  So I say, “It is my great honor,” a very high honor, if you wi ll, “to introduce our guest speaker.”  “To introduce (someone)” in this case means to tell someone or to tell a group of people about another person whom they are probably meeting for the first time.  So, you bring a friend of yours to a part y, and you meet someone that you know but that your friend does not, you would introd uce your friend to the other person there at the party.  In this case, I’m int roducing the speaker; I am saying this person, who you may not know is...and then I g ive a description.  The “guest speaker” is a person who is invited specifically to ta lk at an event: a meeting, a conference perhaps.

I say, “Our speaker is actually a person who needs no intro duction.”  This expression, “to need no introduction,” means that he or she is very well known by other people, that everyone in the audience listening would already know this person.  It’s sort of a way of saying to the person you ar e very famous; it’s kind of a compliment to that person.  So I say, “Our speaker is a ctually a person who needs no introduction, since she is well known in our fiel d as one of its great innovators.”  “Our field” here means whatever area we a re working in or studying in.  My field when I was professor was applied linguisti cs; that was the area that that I studied and did research in.  The presenter here , the guest speaker, is well known in the field of the people at this meeting as on e of the great innovators. An “innovator” (innovator) is someone who is very creative,  someone who will take risks, someone who invents something new.  An innovator  is often the first person to find new ways of doing things or to do things for the first time.

“Edwina Litton,” that’s the name of the guest speaker,  “has been called a revolutionary thinker by those in our field.”  A “revolut ionary thinker” means, in this case, someone who has many new ideas.  These ideas may b e surprising when you first hear them.  They have new ideas about the way things should be done in the world, in particular whatever field we’re  talking about here.  So, a revolutionary thinker is someone who has very bold, perhaps controversial new ideas about something.

I say that Edwina is a revolutionary thinker, “That’s beca use she has strived to bring attention to those issues that we believe are so i mportant.”  “To strive”

 (strive) means to try to do something that is very difficul t, to do something that is not easy: “I’m going to strive to help all of the peopl e in the world learn English who want to learn English.”  It’s not easy; I’m going t o strive to do it, I’m going to put a lot of effort into it, I’m going to work very ha rd in order to accomplish this thing.  So, Edwina has strived to bring attention to ce rtain issues.  “To bring attention to (something)” means to make many people thi nk about something that perhaps they didn’t know before or that they would norm ally not think about, they would normally ignore.  This can be used in many differe nt ways.  You could say to your boss, “I’d like to bring to your attention (or ‘bring your attention to’) something that was in the newspaper this morning.”  You  are telling him about something that he or she probably doesn’t know, because t hey’re working instead of reading their newspaper at their desk.  So, maybe you should be working too!  But, the idea is that you are telling som eone something they didn’t know before.  Well, Edwina has strived to bring attenti on to certain issues – certain topics that this group believes are important.  I should point out it’s also possible to say “striven” here: she has “striven” (en) instea d of “strived” (ed). They both are acceptable in American English.

“Dr. Litton,” I say, “holds four advanced degrees.”  An  “advanced degree” would be something like a master’s degree or a doctoral level d egree (a doctorate), any academic degree – any academic level of achievement that i s higher than your bachelor’s degree.  So you go to college, you study four ye ars, you get an undergraduate degree: your bachelor’s of arts or bache lor’s of science.  After that if you get an additional degree, that would be an ad vanced degree, one that is higher than the undergraduate degree.  A master’s of science, a master’s of art, a master’s of fine arts, a master’s of business administrat ion, a doctor of philosophy, a medical doctor, a doctor of law (a juris do ctor), all of these are advanced degrees.  Well, Dr. Litton has four, and one o f them is obviously a Ph.D., an MD, or some other doctorate.  She also has an  honorary doctorate from Harward University.  Harward University is kind of like  Harvard University; the biggest difference is the “w” in the middle of the  word.  “Honorary” is when you go to a university, typically at the end of the year ce remony called the commencement ceremony, when everyone who is graduating f rom the university will receive their degree – their piece of paper that  says that they have graduated, they have completed their work.  When you go  to these commencement exercises, as they’re called, these commencement ce remonies, they often have someone who is famous or who has done some thing great and they want to honor that person.  They want that person to receive some recognition and so they give them an honorary doctorate, universities do this.  So that person technically is now a doctor, although that’s not really true, but it is a way of honoring that person.

 “In her much-anticipated speech today,” I continue, “she will address what she sees as the future of our field.”  Something that is “m uch anticipated” – “much- anticipated” in this case – is something that people have  been waiting for and looking forward to a long time.  In this speech – this t ime where she is going to stand up and tell you what she thinks, she will address wh at she sees as the future of our field.  “To address” here means to speak about a particular topic, to discuss a particular issue.  There are other meanings of th is word; you can find those in our Learning Guide.

Finally I say, “Without further ado.”  “Without furthe r (or additional) ado.”  This is a formal phrase meaning that you are going to do someth ing right away; you’re not going to continue, in this case, your introduction; you ar e ending your introduction.  “Without further ado (ado), please jo in me in welcoming Dr. Edwina Litton.”  “To join (someone) in welcoming (someone el se)” means that typically you begin to clap your hands so the person feels welcome as the person comes up from their chair to talk to you.  “Join me in wel coming our guest today,” and every one will clap, and the person will feel welcome; t hey will feel like people want him or her to be there.  That’s the idea.

And so without further ado, let’s listen to the dialog ue at a normal rate of speech.

# Being a First-Time Parent

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 6 13: Being a First- Time Parent.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 613.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

We have a website at eslpod.com.  If you go there, you can  improve your English even faster by downloading one of the 8- to 10-page Le arning Guides that we provide for this episode.  It contains a complete transcri pt of everything I say, as well as lots of other good stuff: vocabulary, cultural not es, that sort of thing.

This episode is called “Being a First-Time Parent.”  It is a dialogue between Ricardo and Zuly.  They’re going to be talking about be ing parents, having a baby for the first time.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Zuly:  Hello.

Ricardo:  Hi, Zuly.  How are you?

Zuly:  Oh, Ricardo, it’s you.  I’m doing okay.  How are you?

Ricardo:  I wanted to call and congratulate you on the birth of your new baby.

Zuly:  Thanks a lot.  Carla was born three weeks ago, and  she was eight pounds, three ounces.

Ricardo:  That’s great!  How does it feel to be a first -time parent?

Zuly:  It’s really overwhelming taking care of a newborn.   I’m learning everything from scratch, everything from how to breastfeed and bot tle-feed, to burping her, to putting her to bed, to using a car seat and a stroll er.

Ricardo:  You sound overwhelmed.  I remember when Ada m, our first child, was born.  There were the feedings in the middle of the night, and all of those diapers!

 Zuly:  Exactly.  I’m exhausted all the time.  In fact, I f ind myself dozing off at all hours of the day.

Ricardo:  I really sympathize with you, but these days will  pass quickly, and then you’ll have such great memories.  Have you had much sleep?

Zuly:  Zzzzzzzz!

Ricardo:  Zuly?  Zuly?

[end of dialogue]

Ricardo calls Zuly on the telephone.  Zuly answers, “Hell o.”  Ricardo says, “Hi, Zuly.  How are you?”  Zuly says, “Oh, Ricardo, it’s you (mea ning she recognizes who is calling).  I’m doing okay.  How are you?”  Ricardo  says, “I wanted to call and congratulate you on the birth of your new baby.”  “ Birth” is when a new child is brought into the world; when a baby comes out of his or her mother’s womb – comes out of her body and begins breathing on its own, w e call that birth.  This is the birth of Zuly’s new baby.

Zuly says, “Thanks a lot.  Carla (the name of her baby) was born three weeks ago, and she was eight pounds, three ounces.”  It’s common  for parents to often tell someone about their baby and include how big it w as – how much it weighed. This baby weighed eight pounds, three ounces.  I weighed , I think, nine pounds, four ounces.  I was a big baby – mostly my head!

Ricardo says, “That’s great!  How does it feel to be a fi rst-time parent?”  “First- time” means, as you can guess, that it is the first event –  the first occasion for this particular thing, in this case for being a parent.   So, they are first-time parents.  It could mean that they are going to have mor e children in the future, we don’t know, but definitely it means that this is the ir first baby.

Zuly says, “It’s really overwhelming taking care of a newbo rn.”  Something that is “overwhelming” (one word) is very strong, too strong, too  powerful, something that makes you feel that you don’t have control, it may b e something that confuses you.  If you go to Phoenix, Arizona in the middle  of summer – and I do not recommend it – you will be overwhelmed by the heat.   It is very hot in Phoenix, Arizona in the summertime.  Zuly says that it is o verwhelming taking care of a newborn.  “Newborn” (newborn – one word) i s a baby that has been born very recently, usually within the past month or perha ps two months.

 Zuly is saying that her child is a newborn; she was born re cently.  She says, “I’m learning everything from scratch.”  The expression “fro m scratch” (scratch) means from the very beginning, without any preparation,  or any knowledge in this case.  The term is often used cooking.  “I’m going to ma ke a cake from scratch,” meaning I’m not going to use any prepared ingredient s, I’m not going to go to the store and buy a box that says “lemon cake” on it.  I’m goi ng to get the lemons, get the flour get the eggs and so forth.  That is to make something from scratch. You can use it for anything; you could make a table from  scratch, taking a bunch of wood and putting it together, I guess.  I don’t m ean I could do that, but you could do that.  And if you want to do that you can give the table to me because, see, I need a new table here in my room.  Anyway, Zuly is learning everything from scratch, from the very beginning.  By the way, “scratc h” has other meanings in English, very different.  Those, you can only find in our Learning Guide…and a dictionary…and on the web…but most importantly in our Lea rning Guide!

Zuly says she’s learning everything from how to breastfeed a nd bottle-feed, to burping her, to putting her to bed, to using a car se at and a stroller.  Well, these are all common words when talking about taking care of a  baby.  Let’s begin with my favorite: “breastfeed” (breastfeed – one word).  “To  breastfeed” as a verb means that the mother feeds the young baby with the mil k from her breasts, which are those two things that make up the chest of a w oman.  The end of the breast is called a “nipple” (nipple); we also use that same word when we have a bottle of milk that we are feeding the baby with.  Th at’s the other way to feed the baby, to “bottle-feed” the baby.  A “ bottle,” of cour se, is a small, usually glass container – could be plastic, I guess.  In any case, these a re the two ways of giving milk to a baby: one is to breastfeed and one is to  bottle-feed.  Some people believe breastfeeding is better for the baby.  In any case, Zuly is learning to do both.

She’s also learning to burp her baby.  The verb “to bur p” here means that you take the baby, so I’m told, meaning I don’t do this, bu t you, again, could take the baby and you very gently, very softly hit the back of the bab y after the baby has drunken milk to help the baby push air out of the stoma ch into his or her mouth. This usually produces what we would call “spit up” (spit up).  This is something that mothers or fathers will do for their baby after t hey have been fed with milk. That’s one of the things Zuly is learning how to do.  S he’s also learning how to put the baby to bed.  “To put (someone) to bed” is a phrasal verb meaning to get a baby or a child ready to sleep, try to calm him or her  until he or she falls asleep. Sometimes mothers and fathers will move the child back a nd forth very slowly, gently.  They may sing a song; we call those songs that you  sing to a baby to put them to sleep a “lullaby” (lullaby).  A common lullaby i n English is called “Lullaby

 and Goodnight,” using music from the classical composer Brah ms:  Lullaby and goodnight .  I don’t know the rest of the words; when my mother sa ng it to me, that’s all I needed and I fell asleep.  Sorry!

Zuly is also learning how to use a car seat.  In the Uni ted States it is the law in most states, you are required to place your baby in a speci al I guess we could call at a chair that goes inside the car.  It is to keep t hem safe in an accident.  So, Zuly is learning how to use a car seat and a stroller.  A  “stroller” (stroller) is also called a “baby carriage.”  Basically, it’s like a small chai r that has wheels on it that you can push in front of you.  So, if you want to t ake a walk you could put the baby in the stroller.  When I was growing up, strolle rs were very small. Nowadays, at least here in the United States, you see so me parents that have strollers that are like the size of a small car – they’re  huge!  And they put all of these things that they think they need for the baby; it’ s kind of amazing.

But anyway, getting back to our story: Zuly is learning to use a car seat and a stroller.  Ricardo says, “You sound overwhelmed.  I rememb er when Adam, our first child (Ricardo’s first baby), was born.  There were the feedings in the middle of the night, and all those diapers!”   “Feeding” (f eeding), a noun, comes from the verb “to feed,” which means to give food to someone, in this case to give the baby milk, either from a bottle or, we would say, “nursi ng,” which is another term referring to breastfeeding.  So there are feedings in  the middle of the night; young babies wake up in the middle of the night and wa nt to eat.  You could tell them just to wait until morning, but they probably won ’t be too happy, and you probably won’t sleep because they’ll be crying, you see!  H e also talks about all of the diapers they needed for their little child.  A “diaper” (diaper) is a small piece of cloth or, more commonly in the U.S. now, paper and plastic that is wrapped around the baby’s bottom in order to hold in – to catch , really, their urine, what we would informally called their “pee” (pee) that come s out the front end; out the back end comes what we technically call their “feces” (feces) , but for a baby informally we would say “poop” (poop), “poop.”  Isn’t t his fun?

Zuly says, “Exactly (she agrees with Ricardo).  I’m exhausted all the time.”  “To be exhausted” means to be extremely tired, typically from doing a lot of physical work.  Zuly says, “I find myself,” meaning sometimes, “I f ind myself dozing off at all hours of the day.”  “At all hours of the day” means anytime during the day, at different times during the day.  “To doze (doze) off” m eans to fall asleep for a short period of time, usually something that you weren’ t planning to do.  You just sort of accidentally, if you will, fall asleep because you a re so tired.  We might also use the verb “to nap” (nap): “I was napping at my d esk the other day when Lucy came into the office and woke me up and said I should  start working again.”

 Zuly says that she finds herself dozing off at all hours of  the day.  Ricardo says, “I really sympathize with you,” I really understand your probl em or your difficult situation; I feel sad for you, “but,” he says, “these days ( these early days) will pass quickly (they will not seem like they took very much time) , and then you’ll have such great memories.”  “Memories” are the things th at you remember. Ricardo then asks Zuly, “Have you had much sleep?” and Zuly is sleeping; she goes, “Zzzzzzzz!”  Ricardo says, “Zuly?  Zuly?” trying to wake her up.

I hope you didn’t doze off during this episode.  Now we ’ll listen to the dialogue at a normal rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Zuly:  Hello.

Ricardo:  Hi, Zuly.  How are you?

Zuly:  Oh, Ricardo, it’s you.  I’m doing okay.  How are you?

Ricardo:  I wanted to call and congratulate you on the birth of your new baby.

Zuly:  Thanks a lot.  Carla was born three weeks ago, and  she was eight pounds, three ounces.

Ricardo:  That’s great!  How does it feel to be a first -time parent?

Zuly:  It’s really overwhelming taking care of a newborn.   I’m learning everything from scratch, everything from how to breastfeed and bot tle-feed, to burping her, to putting her to bed, to using a car seat and a stroll er.

Ricardo:  You sound overwhelmed.  I remember when Ada m, our first child, was born.  There were the feedings in the middle of the night, and all of those diapers!

Zuly:  Exactly.  I’m exhausted all the time.  In fact, I f ind myself dozing off at all hours of the day.

Ricardo:  I really sympathize with you, but these days will  pass quickly, and then you’ll have such great memories.  Have you had much sleep?

# Experiencing an Earthquake

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 14: Experiencing an Earthquake.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 614.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Download a Learning Guide f or this episode that will give you all of the definitions, sample sentences, additi onal vocabulary, comprehension questions, cultural notes, and a complete t ranscript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Jamal and Keisha.  Th ey’re talking about something which is very common to many parts of the world,  including Los Angeles: earthquakes.  We’ll go over some of the vocabula ry related to that topic. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jamal:  Did you feel that?

Keisha:  Was that an earthquake?

Jamal:  Yes, I think so.  Turn on the news.

Newscaster:  “Reports are coming in about an earthquake  that occurred at 4:35 p.m. in the downtown area.  We spoke with a seismologi st at the Earthquake Center and learned that the earthquake had a magnitu de of 3.2 on the Richter scale.  The epicenter was near downtown, along one of t he major faults, and the seismologist warns that there will be some aftershocks.”

Keisha:  Phew!  I’m glad the earthquake wasn’t a high -intensity one.  I wish they could predict more accurately when those earthquakes are go ing to happen.

Jamal:  Yeah, me, too.  I’ve looked around the house an d don’t see any damage, though.  I guess our house won’t be declared a disaster a rea.

Keisha:  Don’t be too sure.  Considering the mess you’ve m ade in kitchen, it could easily be called a disaster area.

 Jamal:  In that case, will you be sending aid?  I think I’m too tired to do the dishes.

Keisha:  You won’t be getting any aid from me.  If you ’re hoping for a relief effort, you’d better ask the UN.

[end of dialogue]

Jamal begins by saying, “Did you feel that?”  Keisha says, “ Was that an earthquake?”  An “earthquake” is a short period of time  when the ground shakes or moves because there is some sort of what we would call g eological movement underneath the ground.  Most places that experience ear thquakes often have earthquakes that are very small or minor.  I feel an ear thquake here in Los Angeles maybe once a year, usually it’s small, maybe twice a  year.  It depends on where you live exactly, but that’s about average, alth ough there are many small earthquakes that most people don’t feel that are taking place all the time, at least that’s what I’ve read.

Keisha asks if it was an earthquake; she wasn’t sure.  Usuall y you can tell. Sometimes if you look over at, for example, a lamp and you see the string that you use to turn on the lamp is moving back and forth, wel l that’s a sign that there was something that moved the whole house or the whole a partment.  Jamal says, “Yes, I think so (I think it was an earthquake).  Tur n on the news,” meaning turn on the radio or the television to see if there i s a news report.  Nowadays, we would probably just turn on the computer and look on the Internet.

Next, a newscaster, who sounds surprisingly like Jamal, gives  us the news.  A “newscaster” is someone on the television or that you hear on radio that reads the news to you – tells you what the news is.  The newscas ter says, “Reports (information) are coming in about an earthquake that  occurred at 4:35 p.m. in the downtown area.”  “Reports are coming in” means we are receiving information from different places.  The earthquake “occurred” (it ha ppened; it took place) at 4:35 p.m., in the afternoon, in the downtown area.  “We spoke with a seismologist at the Earthquake Center and learned that the earthquake had a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.”  A “seismologist”  (seismologist) is a scientist who studies earthquakes – who studies the movemen ts of the earth. Here in Southern California there are seismologists at  California Institute of Technology, or what we call here Cal Tech, and usually af ter an earthquake there is a seismologist that is interviewed from this are a – this university research center.  Here, the seismologist is interviewed and says that  the earthquake had a

 magnitude of 3.2.  “Magnitude” (magnitude) is how bi g or small something is; it’s the size of something, usually used in talking about thin gs like earthquakes.  Or, it can also be used to describe a problem: “The magnitud e of the problem is huge (is large).”  The magnitude of the earthquake is how p owerful it is, and there’s a way of measuring this called the Richter scale.  The “Ri chter,” which is the name of the person who helped invent it, is a system for measur ing the size of earthquakes.  A 3.2 is not a serious earthquake.  If it ’s 5-6-7, these are large and potentially very damaging earthquakes – earthquakes that co uld cause a lot of damage: people getting hurt, buildings falling down,  and so forth.

Well, this was a small earthquake, a 3.2.  “The epicente r,” the newscaster continues, “was near downtown.”  The “epicenter” (epicen ter) is where the earthquakes started; it’s like the center of the earthqua ke, the place in the ground where it started.  Earthquakes are caused, as you probably know, by the movement of what we call tectonic plates.  These are part s of the earth that move back, or can move back and forth and that creates the m ovement, which is the earthquake.  The epicenter was downtown – near dow ntown along one of the major faults.  A “fault” (fault) here means or is short  for a “fault line,” which is a crack or a long hole in the earth, where the earth is m oving away from each other so it opens up the earth.  That’s a fault – that’s the manifestation, I should say, of a fault; that’s how you can see where a fault is, but t here isn’t necessarily a hole in the ground right where the fault is.  There are e arthquake faults – areas that would likely have an earthquake all around Southern Cal ifornia, as well as Northern California – although we’re less interested i n them!  The biggest fault here is called the San Andreas fault.  “Fault” has some other meanings in English, very different meanings, and those can be found  in the Learning Guide.

The newscaster continues by saying that the seismologist warn s that there will be some aftershocks.  “Aftershocks” (one word) are small ea rthquakes that happen after a large earthquake.  So when there’s a l arge earthquake, the earth isn’t done moving – it hasn’t stopped moving completely t ypically, and there are additional earthquakes that could happen an hour, two hours, perhaps even days from the original, large earthquake.

Now we’re back to Keisha and Jamal.  Keisha says, “Phew!” w hich is just a way of expressing relief.  “Phew!  I’m glad the earthquake wasn’t a high-intensity one.”  “High-intensity” means a strong, a powerful one.   It lasts usually a short time, but it is very powerful.  This was not a high-int ensity earthquake.  Keisha says, “I wish they could predict more accurately when those ea rthquakes are going to happen.”  “To predict” means to say what is goi ng to happen in the future.  Seismologists are trying to get better at pre dicting when earthquakes will

 take place so that they can warn people in advance, but un fortunately the science is not yet sufficiently advanced to do that.

Jamal says, “Yeah, me, too,” meaning I agree, I wish also  the seismologists could predict more accurately.  Jamal says, “I’ve looked arou nd the house and I don’t see any damage (any harm).”  “Damage” is what resu lts when things are broken or destroyed.  He says, “I guess our house won’t be declared a disaster area.”  “To be declared” is a formal way of saying to b e officially named something or to be put in a certain category.  A “disast er area” is an area where there has been a lot of damage – people have been hur t; people have died – usually because of what we would call a natural disaster.  A “disaster” (disaster) is when there is a large event that harms or hurts many people or causes a lot of damage.  Sometimes we use “disaster” to describe a situat ion where everything went wrong: “How was your date last night with Julie?” and you say, “Oh, it was a disaster!  She talked about her ex-boyfriend the whole night.”  Here, however, “disaster” is used in the more traditional way.  In the United States when there is a lot of damage due to a natural disaster, which wou ld be an earthquake, a flood, tornadoes, a hurricane, anything that is caused by the for ces of nature, the government will sometimes declare an area a disaster area , and that makes it eligible – that qualifies it – that means that it can  receive additional money and help from the government.

Jamal says that the house is not damaged and will not be declared a disaster area.  Keisha says, “Don’t be too sure.  Considering the mess you’ve made in kitchen, it could easily be called a disaster area.”  Her e, we’re seeing the other use of the word “disaster” to describe a very negative situ ation.  In this case, Jamal has made a mess – he has made the kitchen dirty, and  that, Keisha says, is also a disaster area.  Jamal, joking of course, says, “In that case, will you be sending aid?”  “Aid” (aid) is help.  In a disaster it’ s usually food, medical supplies, other things that a country needs or an area needs after  a disaster: drinking water, money, and so forth.  To “send aid,” then, woul d be to send those things to the disaster area.

Jamal is joking, saying that he needs aid to clean up the  kitchen.  He says, “I think I’m too tired to do the dishes.”  Keisha says, “Yo u won’t be getting any aid from me (I’m not going to help you).  If you’re hopi ng for a relief effort, you’d better ask the UN.”  “Relief” (relief) is a change in  a situation, in a bad situation things get better.  “Relief efforts” are when organiza tions and governments try to organize aid.  They have a committee – they have leaders t hat organize the money, the food, the medical supplies, and other things .  Usually after a major disaster – and there have been unhappily many in recent ye ars – there is a relief

 effort organized by different countries, by organization s such as the Red Cross. The “UN” is the United Nations, which of course is the la rge international organization that tries to solve problems among nations, as well as help when there is a disaster.  Keisha, continuing the joke, says tha t there is going to be no relief effort and that Jamal should ask the United Nat ions to help him with the disaster area he created in the kitchen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jamal:  Did you feel that?

Keisha:  Was that an earthquake?

Jamal:  Yes, I think so.  Turn on the news.

Newscaster:  “Reports are coming in about an earthquake  that occurred at 4:35 p.m. in the downtown area.  We spoke with a seismologi st at the Earthquake Center and learned that the earthquake had a magnitu de of 3.2 on the Richter scale.  The epicenter was near downtown, along one of t he major faults, and the seismologist warns that there will be some aftershocks.”

Keisha:  Phew!  I’m glad the earthquake wasn’t a high -intensity one.  I wish they could predict more accurately when those earthquakes are go ing to happen.

Jamal:  Yeah, me, too.  I’ve looked around the house an d don’t see any damage, though.  I guess our house won’t be declared a disaster a rea.

Keisha:  Don’t be too sure.  Considering the mess you’ve m ade in kitchen, it could easily be called a disaster area.

Jamal:  In that case, will you be sending aid?  I think I’m too tired to do the dishes.

Keisha:  You won’t be getting any aid from me.  If you ’re hoping for a relief effort, you’d better ask the UN.

# Watching Daytime Talk Shows

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 15: Watching Daytime Talk Shows.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 615.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website – well, you know – it’s eslpod.com.  You also know that you can download a Learning Guide from our website.  If you’r e not a member please consider supporting the podcast by becoming one.  You’ll f eel good about yourself, and your English will improve!

This episode is a dialogue between Sally and Jerry.  It’s about daytime talk shows.  These are shows where people are interviewed oft en about rather strange and unusual topics.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sally:  Why are wasting your time on your day off watch ing these daytime talk shows?

Jerry:  I think they’re entertaining.

Sally:  You’ve got to be kidding.  The only people who are booked as guests on those shows are losers or exhibitionists who want attention .

Jerry:  No, they’re not.  These shows are all about human  drama and tragedy, something we can all relate to.

Sally:  Give me a break!  The people who appear on the se shows want fame at any cost and the producers of the shows exploit them for r atings.  They’re full of salacious details that nobody should talk about in public, and that I certainly don’t want to hear.

Jerry:  I completely disagree.  If you get off your high  horse for a minute, you may learn something.

Sally:  Like what?

 Jerry:  Like how to get rid of an annoying wife and ge t away with it!

[end of dialogue]

Sally begins by saying, “Why are wasting your time on your day off watching these daytime talk shows?”  That’s a question for Jerry.  Yo ur “day off” (two words) is a day when you do not have to go to work, altho ugh normally you would work that day.  So if you, for example, had a vacat ion day, you decided to take Friday off, we would say that is a day off.

Well, Jerry has the day off, he’s not working, and he’s spe nding his time watching daytime talk shows.  Daytime talk shows are very popular in  the U.S.  They’re usually on television sometime between 9 o’clock in the mor ning and five o’clock in the evening.  A “talk show” is where you have typically one person, we call that person the “host,” who speaks to different guests who come and visit him or her. Sometimes they’re famous people, sometimes they’re avera ge, unknown people who are coming to talk about some problem.  In the last  20 years or so, daytime talk shows have become more and more controversial.  They tr y to get people to pay attention to them by having all sorts of usual topi cs.  Often there will actually be people who are fighting on the talk shows, although  some of this I think is probably fake, that is, they bring people on who preten d to fight.  In any case, daytime talk shows, and you can tell I don’t watch many of  them, are popular with people watching TV in the daytime.  Now, they’re not a ll bad, but they’re not to be confused with a serious news interview; that is certainly no t what you will find on most daytime talk shows.

Jerry answers Sally’s question by saying, “I think they’re ente rtaining (I have fun watching them).”  Sally says, “You’ve got to be kidding.”  The expression “you’ve got to be kidding” or “you have to be kidding” is used t o show that you think the person you’re talking to is saying something very surprising,  unbelievable, perhaps even a little ridiculous.  Somebody says, “I am go ing to read my horoscope and I will plan my day according to that.”  You r “horoscope” is the idea that events in your life are controlled by the planets a nd the stars.  Another person may say, “You’ve got to be kidding.  Why do you waste  your time on reading horoscopes?”  Well here, Sally is wondering why J erry is wasting his time watching daytime talk shows.  She continues, “The onl y people who are booked as guests on those shows are losers or exhibitionists who want attention.”  “To book (someone)” as a verb means to sched ule a date and time typically when someone will perform in a show or partici pate in a show.  If you have a music band, a group that plays music, you might have a restaurant or a party that wants to book you.  They want to have you come a nd perform on a

 certain day and time.  This verb “to book” is also used wh en the police arrest someone and decide to accuse them or charge them with a cr ime.  I don’t know why we use he same verb, but we do.  Maybe some performa nces are so bad that people think the performer should booked for takin g their money, I’m not sure!  When we use it in relation to the police, it’s u sually with the preposition “for”: “He was booked for murder.”  “He was booked for robbery.”

Anyway, we’re talking about daytime talk shows and Sally is saying that the only people who come on as guests – who are booked as guests a re losers or exhibitionists.  A “loser” is a person who has had littl e or no success in life, who doesn’t seem to be very successful and is not respected by othe r people.  It’s an insulting term, to be sure.  An “exhibitionist” is someo ne who likes to do strange or unusual things because he or she wants other people to  notice them; he or she wants attention, when other people are looking at you and listening to you. So people who, for example – I don’t know, take off t heir clothes in the middle of a shopping center, that could be an exhibitionist, someb ody who wants to have other people pay attention to them.  If you do that, you’ll probably be booked for some crime!  Sally is saying that the people on this kind o f program are losers or exhibitionists, and there’s some truth to that.  If you w atch some of these shows you can see that there are some people on there who just  want other people to pay attention.  They want to be famous, I guess.

Jerry disagrees, he says, “No, they’re not.  These shows are a ll about human drama.”  “Human drama” refers to relationships between  two or more people that are somehow exciting, often more than seems necessary or go od.  Jerry says the shows are also about tragedy.  “Tragedy” is something that is very bad, something that is very sad that has happened, often rela ted to someone dying. Jerry thinks these shows are something we can all relate t o.  “To relate to (something)” is to connect with something on an intellect ual or emotional level, to understand something because it is similar to something th at has happened in your life.

Sally says, “Give me a break!” which is an expression – an inf ormal expression we use when we are telling the person that we don’t b elieve them.  “The people who appear on these shows want fame at any cost.”  “Fame ” is to be well known – famous.  “At any cost” means no matter how difficult so mething is.  These people want to be famous, and it doesn’t matter what  they do to be famous – to get fame.  She says, “the producers of the shows (the peo ple who organize these shows) exploit them for ratings.”  “To exploit (exploit) (someone)” means to use someone, to make someone do something for you, often hu rting or treating the other person unfairly.  So, to exploit something would be to take someone who is

 innocent and, we would use the expression, take advantage of them.  That is, do something because perhaps they are too weak or they are n ot very smart, and you do something that benefits you and usually hurts them.   Well, the producers are exploiting these exhibitionists and losers for ratings.   “Ratings” here refers to how popular a television show is compared to other televi sion shows.  If you say, “The television show has good ratings,” you mean that it ’s very popular, there are a lot people who watch it.  Sally continues, she says these shows are full of salacious details that nobody should talk about in public.  “Salacious” (salacious) means too much interest in sex or sexually related topics, t hings that are perhaps inappropriate, things that you shouldn’t be talking a bout in public with other people.  And that’s certainly true that these shows ofte n have a lot of salacious details that are discussed and talked about.

Jerry says, “I completely disagree.  If you get off your high  horse for a minute, you may learn something.”  The expression “to get off you r high horse,” like the animal, means to stop acting as if you were superior to other people, stop pretending that you are better than others.  It’s a ne gative, insulting thing to say to someone: “get off your high horse.”  You’re saying t o them “You think you are better than everyone else.”

Jerry thinks Sally could learn something from these shows.  Sally asks, “Like what?”  Jerry responds, “Like how to get rid of an annoyi ng wife and get away with it!”  “To get rid (rid) of (something)” is a phr asal verb meaning to no longer have someone or something in your presence or around, t o do something so that you don’t need to have any contact with this person.  Some times it means simply to throw out, to put in the garbage: “I’m going to get rid of this trash that is on my desk.”  It can also be used informally to mean to kill som eone, and that’s the meaning that Jerry is using here, he’s joking of course – I  hope!  He says he can learn how to get rid of an annoying wife.  Someone w ho is “annoying” is someone who is bothersome, someone who is always causing pro blems.

Not only does Jerry want to get rid of his annoying wife , he also wants to get away with it.  The expression “to get away with (somethin g)” means not to be punished for something bad that you have done.  You do something bad but you are not punished; you are not discovered perhaps, no one finds out, or for whatever reason you are not punished for doing somethin g wrong.  That’s to get away with it.  We talk about people getting away with murder.  The most famous case of that here in Los Angeles took place in the 1990s with a former football player by the name of O.J. Simpson.  He, according to mo st people who looked at the evidence, killed his wife and another man, but he was not found guilty. Unfortunately later he committed a robbery and is in pr ison now, not for the

 murder but for another crime he committed.  You can ge t away with things that are less serious, of course.  Children may get away with mi sbehaving in class because the teacher is too busy or too tired to punish the m.  That used to happen to me all time!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sally:  Why are wasting your time on your day off watch ing these daytime talk shows?

Jerry:  I think they’re entertaining.

Sally:  You’ve got to be kidding.  The only people who are booked as guests on those shows are losers or exhibitionists who want attention .

# Having a Business Mentor

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 16: Having a Business Mentor.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 616.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  Download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even faster.  Yo u can also take a look at our ESL Podcast Store, which has some additional courses in English.

This episode is called “Having a Business Mentor.”  A “men tor” is a person who gives you advice.  It’s a conversation between Alex and Kenya.   Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alex:  Where are you going?

Kenya:  I’m going to meet my business mentor.

Alex:  Your business mentor?  What do you do with a busin ess mentor?

Kenya:  Well, my mentor is like an advisor.  We meet reg ularly and I get her feedback and guidance with my ideas on starting a business.

Alex:  Oh, so you’re her protégé?

Kenya:  No, I’m not.  I simply go to her with my ideas a nd she helps me hash them out.  She’s a successful entrepreneur and I’m there  to learn from her experience.

Alex:  How did you get her to be your mentor?  Were yo u already friends?

Kenya:  No, I contacted her out of the blue, actually.  I’ve read about her company and her many successes, and I wrote her a letter te lling her about me and what I hope to accomplish.  She agreed to meet wit h me, and at that first meeting, we really clicked and now we meet once a month.

Alex:  That’s very generous of her.  What does she get out  of it?

 Kenya:  I’m not sure, but I think she enjoys giving me po inters and sharing her expertise.  I’m very appreciative and she says I remind her  a lot of herself when she was my age.  I take that as a huge compliment.

Alex:  You should.  If you’re like her, you’ll be a mult i-millionaire in no time flat.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Alex saying to Kenya, “Where a re you going?”  Kenya responds, “I’m going to meet my business mentor.”  A “men tor,” or “mentor,” (mentor) is a person who provides advice, help to someone for free, usually someone who is either much younger or someone who is less  experienced in a particular area.  So if you decided to become a lawyer –  and I hope you don’t – then you may find an older lawyer, or a lawyer with mor e experience to be your mentor, to help you, to give you advice, and so forth.

Kenya says, “I’m going to meet my business mentor,” so obviou sly this has to do with helping her in her business.  Alex says, “Your business mentor?  What do you do with a business mentor?”  Kenya says, “Well, my mento r is like an advisor.”  An “advisor” (advisor) is someone who also provide s advice to another person, who helps someone make a decision.  A mentor is one kind of advisor. Kenya says that she and her business mentor meet “regularl y,” meaning on a schedule, perhaps at the same time and the same day each  week or each month.  She says, “I get her feedback and guidance with m y ideas on starting a business.”  “Feedback” (feedback) is your opinion about how  something is doing, whether something is working well, whether it is a good  idea.  The verb we use is typically “give” – “to give feedback.”  We appreciate your f eedback on our podcast – your opinions, your advice, and so forth.  Well,  Kenya gets feedback from her mentor.  She also gets guidance (guidance).  “ Guidance” is another word for advice, assistance, help on how to do something co rrectly; in this case, how to start a new business.

Alex says, “Oh, so you’re her protégé?”  “Protégé” (prot égé) is a word that we borrowed from the French.  In English, it means a pers on who receives advice, help, guidance, perhaps even money from someone who is ol der or more experienced.  So, the protégé is the person who is receivi ng – who is getting the advice.

Kenya responds, “No, I’m not.  I simply go to her with m y ideas and she helps me hash them out.”  To “hash (hash) (something) out” or  to “hash out (something)” is

 a two-word phrasal verb meaning to discuss something in g reat detail, to look at every possible piece of information about something, to spend a long time discussing it.  Often we use this expression when two people  have different views – if they have a disagreement about something, and  they’re trying to come to an agreement.  Kenya says that she’s not her business men tor’s protégé, but I think she really is.  Perhaps she just doesn’t like that wo rd, I’m not sure why. You will have to ask Kenya!

Kenya says that her business mentor is a successful entrepreneu r “and I’m there to learn from her experience.”  “Entrepreneur” is anot her word from the French. In English it means someone who takes risks and starts a new  business, usually a small-business owner.  Someone who decides to start thei r own business is an entrepreneur (entrepreneur).

Alex then asks, “How did you get her to be your mentor?  Were you already friends?”  Kenya replies, “No, I contacted her out of the blue, actually.”  Kenya contacted – made contact with her by calling or emailing or sending a bird with a message or throwing a bottle into the water with a me ssage.  All of these are ways to contact people.  You can contact us here in Los An geles.  If you live near an ocean, just put your note into a bottle and throw the bottle into the ocean and eventually we’ll get it – or email!

Where were we?  Kenya – yes.  Kenya had contacted her me ntor out of the blue. The expression “out of the blue,” like the color blue, m eans unexpectedly, something you weren’t expecting, or something you do wi thout planning, without any previous connection to the person.  In this case, it is really the last meaning: without any previous or prior relationship.  “Somebody ca lled me out of the blue and asked me to teach their daughter English.”  I did n ot know this person; they contacted me and I wasn’t expecting it.  Well, Kenya cont acted her mentor out of the blue.  She read about her company and her many succe sses, the things that she was successful at, and so Kenya wrote her a letter telli ng her about herself and what she hopes to accomplish.  To “accomplish” means to do something successfully, especially something that is difficult or unusual.   The noun is “accomplishment.”  Running down the street isn’t an accomp lishment, but running a marathon is.  A marathon is a long race.  So , it has to be something difficult.  The mentor has many accomplishments.  She agr eed to meet with Kenya, and at their first meeting, she says, “we really cl icked.”  When we say that we “click with” someone, or simply “we clicked,” it means tha t we had a good relationship almost immediately with the other person, that we enjoy talking to each other, that it didn’t take long for us to become co mfortable with each other.

 The word “click” (click) has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more information.

Now Kenya says she and her mentor meet once a month.  Ale x says, “That’s very generous of her (that’s very nice of her).  What does she get out of it?”  The expression “to get (something) out of (something else)” m eans to receive some benefit from your action or your participation in someth ing, that you get something too.  So if you help, for example, teach a yo ung child to read, the child learns to read and what you get out of it is the joy, t he satisfaction of knowing that you helped that young child do something.

Alex wants to know what the mentor gets out of this rela tionship with Kenya. Kenya says, “I’m not sure, but I think she enjoys giving me pointers and sharing her expertise.”  A “pointer” (pointer) here means a pi ece of advice, a recommendation, we might say a “tip” (tip).  That’s a p ointer.  There are some additional meanings in the Learning Guide on this wor d as well.  “Expertise” (expertise) – notice that it is spelled with an “i” at t he end, “ise,” but is pronounced like it were an “e,” “expertise.”  Well, “exp ertise” is special knowledge about a certain subject, a certain what we may call fie ld – area of study or interest.  A person who has expertise is called an “expert. ”  Kenya says that she’s very appreciative; she’s appreciative of her mentor.  “ Appreciative” means that you feel thankful, you feel grateful for somethin g that another person has done for you.  We should all be more appreciative of o ur families, our houses, our jobs, and so forth.  There’s always things to be appr eciative for in our world.

Kenya is appreciative of her mentor.  Her mentor says that  Kenya reminds her a lot of herself when she was my age.  “She reminds her  of herself,” meaning she sees something about her own experience in Kenya.  “I t ake that as a huge compliment,” Kenya says.  A “compliment” (compliment) mea ns nice words about someone showing that you respect them, you appreciate the m, you admire them. That’s a compliment.  There’s another word pronounced t he same, “complement,” except there’s an “e” in the middle of the word, that means something very different.  “Complement” with an “e” i s something that goes along with or matches or completes something else.  A “complimen t” with an “i” is a nice thing you say about someone.  If your husband or wife  cooks you a good meal you should compliment them.  In fact, even if it i sn’t good you should compliment them!

Well, Kenya takes the fact that this woman sees herself in Kenya as a huge, or big, compliment.  Alex says, “You should (you should take it  as a compliment).  If you’re like her,” Alex says, “you’ll be a multi-millionair e in no time flat.”  “Multi- (or

 multi-)” (multi-) is a prefix (something that goes in f ront of the word) that means many or more than one.  So, a “multi-millionaire” is someone who makes more than a million dollars – 2 million, 3 million, 10 mi llion dollars a year, let’s say.  The expression “in no time flat” (flat) means very quickly, very soon, in the very near future.  Alex means that if Kenya is like her mentor she will soon be a multi- millionaire.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alex:  Where are you going?

Kenya:  I’m going to meet my business mentor.

Alex:  Your business mentor?  What do you do with a busin ess mentor?

Kenya:  Well, my mentor is like an advisor.  We meet reg ularly and I get her feedback and guidance with my ideas on starting a business.

Alex:  Oh, so you’re her protégé?

Kenya:  No, I’m not.  I simply go to her with my ideas a nd she helps me hash them out.  She’s a successful entrepreneur and I’m there  to learn from her experience.

Alex:  How did you get her to be your mentor?  Were yo u already friends?

# Buying Bathroom Supplies

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 17: Buying Bathroom Supplies.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 617.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You probably know that, but d id you know that you can download a Learning Guide for this episode?  You d id?  Oh, all right!

Well, this episode is a dialogue between Tim and Jan ab out buying things that you would need in your bathroom.  We all need bathroo ms, and there are things you need to buy for them.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jan:  We’re almost done.  We just need to get some bat hroom supplies for Kimberly.

Tim:  Okay, here are some towels, a bathmat and a bath room scale.  Don’t forget the cleaning supplies.  She’ll need some rubber gloves, d isinfectant, bowl cleaner, and a plunger.

Jan:  All right.  We have all that.  Where are you go ing?

Tim:  She’ll need a soap dish and a toothbrush holder .  She’ll need a trashcan, too.

Jan:  Okay, I think we’re all done.  Kimberly is moving in to an apartment with college roommates, not starting her own bathroom suppl y store.  Let’s not go overboard.

Tim:  I just need to get a couple more things.

Jan:  What?

Tim:  I’m buying her 10 packages of toilet paper and 20  boxes of Kleenex.  She’ll be living on her own for the first time and she’ll nee d all that.

 Jan:  Ten packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Kleen ex?!  She can shop for herself, you know.  You don’t need to buy her a six-month  supply.

Tim:  Clearly you don’t know college students.  They’ll go  through that in a week!

[end of dialogue]

Jan begins our dialogue by saying, “We’re almost done,” meaning we’re almost finished; we’ve almost completed our job – our task.  “We  just need to get some bathroom supplies for Kimberly.”  “Supply” (supply) is som ething that you need to do a particular activity or for a particular purpose.  So  if you are going to climb a mountain, you would probably need certain supplies such as food, water, clothing – I hope!

Well, these supplies that Jan and Tim are buying are for Kimberly’s bathroom. Kimberly is, I guess, their daughter.  Tim says, “Okay, he re are some towels, a bathmat and a bathroom scale.”  A “towel” is a large piece of fabric, something that absorbs water and you use it to dry yourself or to d ry something else.  Most towels are made of what we would call cloth; you could a lso have towels made of paper – paper towels, but for the bathroom you probab ly aren’t going to use paper towels.  A “bathmat” (bathmat – one word) is som ething you put on the ground in front of your shower or your bathtub, which i s where you wash yourself. The bathmat helps prevent the floor from getting wet from the water that would, of course, come off of you if you took a shower or a bat h.  A “bathroom scale” (scale) is something you put on the floor, you stand on it , and it tells you how much you weigh – that is, how many pounds or how many kilo s.  I personally like to weigh myself in kilos because it’s always a smaller number  than pounds!

Tim says, “Don’t forget the cleaning supplies,” the thing s you would need to clean a bathroom.  He says that Kimberly will need some rubber  gloves, disinfectant, bowl cleaner, and a plunger.  “Gloves” are things you pu t on your hands that cover your fingers and your hand.  “Rubber gloves” are gl oves made either from a plant or artificially, we would say synthetically.  Rubbe r is what you usually see on tires; tires are made of rubber – tires for your car.   Well, this is rubber gloves to keep your hands dry.  The other things that Tim thin ks they need to buy include disinfectant.  “Disinfectant” (disinfectant) is typi cally a liquid cleaning product, something that will kill bacteria – will kill things that might harm you.  To disinfect something is to remove the bacteria – the germs (germs) that might be on that surface, things that could make you sick.  A bowl cl eaner is also recommended by Tim.  The “bowl” here refers to the to ilet bowl, so a “bowl cleaner” is cleaner that will clean the inside of a toi let.  Finally, he recommends a

 plunger, which is not a cleaning supply.  A “plunger” (p lunger) is something that has a long, typically wooden stick, and at the end of the stick is a round piece of rubber, and you use this if you have a toilet that is no t flushing – that is, the water is not taking away what’s inside the toilet bowl.  You u se a plunger to create pressure to push what is preventing the water from leavi ng the toilet bowl out into the pipes, which take the water from the toilet bowl down into your city’s sewer system.  A “sewer” (sewer) is a system of pipes that take dirt y water away from your house.

So, that’s what a plunger is, and Tim thinks that Kimbe rly needs one.  Jan says, “All right.  We have all that.  Where are you going? ”  Tim says, “She’ll need a soap dish and a toothbrush holder.”  You can buy soap for  your bathroom that is a liquid.  You can also buy a solid form of soap, what w e would call a bar (bar) of soap, but you need a place to put the bar of soap so that it doesn’t slide around – it doesn’t move around.  That little container is calle d a “soap dish.”  “Dish” like you use for food, but this is one for soap.  A “toothbru sh” is what you use to clean your teeth; “tooth” is the singular of “teeth.”  A “t oothbrush holder” is a place to put your toothbrush.  Usually it’s something that has hole s in it that you can put a toothbrush in so that it will hold it – a toothbrush h older.  Tim also says that she’ll need a trashcan.  “Trash” (trash) is another word for g arbage, things that you are throwing away that you don’t want anymore.  A “trashca n” is where you put that garbage – those things.

Jan says, “Okay, I think we’re all done (we’re all finish ed).  Kimberly is moving into an apartment with college roommates,” people tha t she went to college with; her “roommates” are sharing the apartment.  “She’s no t starting her own bathroom supply store,” Jan says.  She’s joking; she thinks T im is buying too many things.  She says, “Let’s not go overboard.”  The e xpression “to go overboard” (overboard – one word) means to do too much of something, to go to an extreme about something, to do too much.

Tim says, “I just need to get a couple more things (I ju st need to get two or three, maybe four things).”  Jan says, “What?”  Tim says, “I’m buyin g her 10 packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Kleenex.”  “Toilet pap er” is soft paper that you use when you are going to the bathroom, when you are usin g the toilet – I think you know how that works!  “Kleenex” (Kleenex) is technically a t ype of what we would otherwise call tissues or facial tissues, but this particular  company’s product has become so popular that people just call facial tissues Klee nex even if it isn’t made by that company.  It’s what you use, for example, if you are going to blow your nose, or if you need to wipe your eyes after you’ve b een crying, then you would want to have some Kleenex.  Notice we typically say “b oxes of Kleenex.”

 We sometimes refer to the toilet paper as “rolls of toi let paper” because the paper is wrapped around in a circle.

Tim says that Kimberly will be living on her own for the  first time and she’ll need all that – all of those things.  “To live on your own” means to live outside of your family’s house, to live by yourself without any relatives.  I t can also mean without any roommates, although that isn’t what Tim means here .

Jan says, “Ten packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Klee nex?!  She can shop for herself, you know (she can buy things for herself) .”  She says, “You don’t need to buy her a six-month supply.”  That is, eno ugh toilet paper for six months.  Tim says, “Clearly you don’t know college students.   They’ll go through that in a week!”  So it seems that Kim is still in colleg e; I said before she was living with people she went – past tense – to college with.  But I guess she’s still in college because Tim says that Jan doesn’t know college stud ents.  She doesn’t have experience – information about them.  Tim says, “They’ll go through that in a week!”  “To go through (something)” is a two -word phrasal verb meaning to use all of something so that there is nothing left.   If you work in an office and you have to print out a lot of letters and reports, you will go through a lot of paper – you will use up a lot of paper.  “Go through” has som e other meanings in English, and those can be found in the Learning Guide .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jan:  We’re almost done.  We just need to get some bat hroom supplies for Kimberly.

Tim:  Okay, here are some towels, a bathmat and a bath room scale.  Don’t forget the cleaning supplies.  She’ll need some rubber gloves, d isinfectant, bowl cleaner, and a plunger.

Jan:  All right.  We have all that.  Where are you go ing?

Tim:  She’ll need a soap dish and a toothbrush holder .  She’ll need a trashcan, too.

Jan:  Okay, I think we’re all done.  Kimberly is moving in to an apartment with college roommates, not starting her own bathroom suppl y store.  Let’s not go overboard.

 Tim:  I just need to get a couple more things.

Jan:  What?

Tim:  I’m buying her 10 packages of toilet paper and 20  boxes of Kleenex.  She’ll be living on her own for the first time and she’ll nee d all that.

Jan:  Ten packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Kleen ex?!  She can shop for herself, you know.  You don’t need to buy her a six-month  supply.

Tim:  Clearly you don’t know college students.  They’ll go  through that in a week!

# Eating at a Casual Restaurant

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 18: Eating at a Casual Restaurant.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 618.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Lear ning Guide for this episode.  If you are serious in improving your English, t hen you’ll want to look at our Learning Guide.

This episode is called “Eating at a Casual Restaurant.”  It’s a dialogue between Russell and Nadia using vocabulary you associate with eating at a casual or less expensive restaurant.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Russell:  Why aren’t you eating?  Is there something the matter with your food?

Nadia:  No, the food is fine.

Russell:  What’s wrong?

Nadia:  I’m not sure how to put this.  I really like go ing to diners and hole in the walls with you, and I love mom and pop restaurants as much  as you do.  For me, it’s the food that counts, not the ambiance, but…

Russell:  I thought you’d love this place.  It’s my favorite  greasy spoon.

Nadia:  I do like it.  It’s just that when you invited m e out for my birthday and said that it would be something really special, I thought you  might take me somewhere else.

Russell:  Is that why you wore that nice new dress?  You t hought I was taking you to a fancy restaurant, with tablecloths, mood lightin g, and snooty waiters.

Nadia:  Well…

 Russell:  This is much better, don’t you think?  We get to  sit in this comfortable booth, listen to the jukebox, and watch our food being  cooked behind the counter.  I can’t think of a better dining experience.  Don’t you agree?

Nadia:  Uh, sure.

Russell:  And don’t think you’re not getting something special for your birthday.  I planned it all ahead of time.

Nadia:  You did?  Really?  What is it?

Russell:  I ordered you a whole pie!

[end of dialogue]

Russell begins our dialogue by asking Nadia, “Why aren’t y ou eating?  Is there something the matter with your food?”  The expression “ something the matter with” means a problem with something, something that isn’t right, something isn’t correct.  This is a very common expression in American English:  “Is there’s something the matter with you?”  That means is there som ething wrong with you, is there a problem.  Or you might say, “There’s something  the matter with the television.  It isn’t working correctly.”  It’s a good expre ssion to know; it is very common in conversational English.

Nadia says, answering Russell’s question, “No, the food is f ine.”  The food is okay.  Russell then says, “What’s wrong?”  Nadia says, “I’m no t sure how to put this.”  The phrase “how to put this” or “how to put it ” is used when you want to say something but you are afraid that what you are goin g to say will hurt the other person’s feelings or that it will make them angry or upset.  So you might say, “Well, I don’t know how to put this, but you should really not wear that dress. It doesn’t look good on you.”  Husbands, I recommend thi s with your wives.  You should just tell them that they don’t look good in thei r dresses.  I’m kidding, of course.  If you believe that you won’t be married very l ong!

Nadia says, “I really like going to diners and hole in the walls with you, and I love mom and pop restaurants as much as you do.”  Nadia describ es three kinds of restaurants, similar kinds of informal, casual, less expensive restaurants.  The first is a diner.  A “diner” typically has a kitchen that i s somewhat in the open; you can see it.  There’s typically a long what we would call a  “counter,” which is a place where people can sit, sort of like a bar where the re’s a long piece of wood – a long piece of furniture that everyone sits in fron t of.  In other words, it’s not

 like a table, where you sit on one side and I sit on the  other.  Now, diners will also have tables.  Sometimes they’ll have a special kind of tabl e, which we call a “booth.”  Actually, what’s special about it is the seats.  Instead of being individual chairs, a booth has sort of like a little couch on each side  of the table.

Well, anyway.  Diners serve informal, inexpensive meals.  D iners are often associated with the 1950s and 60s.  That’s when they were very popular, when America started driving and diners were places you could dr ive to and eat and get a cheap meal.  A “hole in the wall” describes any bu siness, including a restaurant, that doesn’t look very nice, especially from t he outside, and is not expensive or fancy.  A hole in the wall could be a bar, i t could be a restaurant, it’s an informal place.  Somewhat of a negative description:  a hole (hole) in the wall. A “mom and pop” business refers to any business that is typica lly owned by a family, usually a mother and a father.  “Mom” is mother ; “pop” is a old word for father – dad.  But we don’t say “a mom and dad store, ” we say “a mom and pop store,” any business, restaurant, store that is owned by a f amily – a small family. It’s their business; both mother and father, and often children work in the business.

So, Nadia says that she likes going to diners and hole in the walls and mom and pop restaurants.  “For me,” she says, “it’s the food that counts, not the ambiance.”  “The food that counts” is a form of a more  general expression: “it’s the (something) that counts.”  This phrase is used to sho w that one particular thing is what is really important, what really matters.  For some people, if they go on vacation they don’t care about how much it costs, they d on’t care about what kind of room they have at the hotel, it’s the temperatu re – it’s the weather that counts.  That’s the most important for them, that it be  warm for example.  Well that’s what Nadia is saying, the most important thing i s the food at a restaurant, not the ambiance.  I should mention that there are som e other meanings coming from that expression, “it’s the (something) that counts,” and those can be found in the Learning Guide.  Getting back to “ambiance” (amb iance), that’s a general word to describe the environment, or more specifically her e, the way that a place looks, especially a restaurant or a bar.  How it feels, wh at kind of lighting it has, what the furniture is like, all of these things are par t of the ambiance.

So you can get the idea here that Nadia is probably goi ng to complain about the ambiance, even though she says the food is the most import ant thing, because at the end of this sentence she says “but…” – “it’s the food th at counts, not the ambiance, but…” and Russell says, “I thought you’d love thi s place (meaning I thought you would love this place).  It’s my favorite gr easy spoon.”  A “greasy (greasy) spoon,” like the spoon you eat with, is a small r estaurant that serves

 informal foods, so it’s similar to the other expressions we  used, but specifically it often serves fried foods such as hamburgers and French fr ies.  Well, hamburgers aren’t fried, but the French fries are.  That’s what a greasy spoon is.  “Grease” is another word here for “fat.”  It’s usually a negative w ay of describing a restaurant.

Russell says that it’s his favorite greasy spoon, the restauran t where they are now.  Nadia says, “I do like it.  It’s just that” – this i s another way of saying “however” – “It’s just that when you invited me out for  my birthday and said that it would be something really special (really nice), I though t you might take me somewhere else.”

Russell says, “Is that why you wore that nice new dress?  You thought I was taking you to a fancy restaurant.”  “Fancy” (fancy) means ve ry nice, very expensive.  A fancy restaurant would have, for example, “ tablecloths” on the tables.  This is a piece of material – a piece of cloth yo u put on top of the table to make it look nice, typically white.  You might also find m ood (mood) lighting. “Mood lighting” is when the lights are used to create a  certain atmosphere – a certain ambiance.  Often the lights are lower than the y would be, less bright for example.  A fancy restaurant might also have snooty waiter s.  “Snooty” (snooty) is a good word.  Someone who is snooty is someone who th inks they are better than other people, and therefore does not treat the other people very well.  I say it’s a good word not because it’s a good word to describ e someone, it’s a negative way of describing someone, but it’s a common word .  Other words that mean something similar are “snobby” (snobby), and more informally “stuck-up” (stuck-up).  All of these are describing someone who thinks they are better than the other people around them and doesn’t treat them  very well.  So, a fancy restaurant might have snooty “waiters,” the people who co me and ask what you want to eat and bring you your food.

Nadia says, “Well…”  Russell then replies, “This is much bett er, don’t you think? We get to sit in this comfortable booth,” remember the  booth is where you have two something like small couches, although they are usuall y made from plastic, around the sides of the table.  Russell says, “We get to si t in this comfortable booth, listen to the jukebox, and watch our food being  cooked behind the counter.”  A “jukebox” (jukebox – one word) is a large ma chine that you put money into and it will play a song for you.  Some bars a nd restaurants have jukeboxes, especially diners that we talked about earlier.   A “counter,” we also talked about earlier, is like a very long table where t he people sit on one side and on the other side there is usually part of the kitchen, a nd there is a waiter or waitress that works on the other side of the counter, so e veryone is facing the same direction.  That’s a counter.

 Russell says, “I can’t think of a better dining experience ( a better place to eat). Don’t you agree?”  Nadia, of course, does not agree, bu t she wants to be nice to Russell.  She says, “Uh, sure.”  Russell says, “And don’t thi nk you’re not getting something special for your birthday.  I planned it all ahead of time (I planned it all in advance).”  “Ahead of time” means before something  happens.  Nadia gets excited about this special thing she’s going to get.  She says, “You did?  Really? What is it?”  And Russell, very disappointingly says, from  Nadia’s perspective, “I ordered you a whole pie!” (pie), which is a dessert mad e usually by baking fruit in a round container that has what we would call “pastry”  or dough on the bottom and on the top.  There are different ways of making pi es.  Of course, a pie is not really what Nadia was hoping for in terms of a special g ift.  So Russell, we think, clearly needs to understand women better!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Russell:  Why aren’t you eating?  Is there something the matter with your food?

Nadia:  No, the food is fine.

Russell:  What’s wrong?

Nadia:  I’m not sure how to put this.  I really like go ing to diners and hole in the walls with you, and I love mom and pop restaurants as much  as you do.  For me, it’s the food that counts, not the ambiance, but…

Russell:  I thought you’d love this place.  It’s my favorite  greasy spoon.

Nadia:  I do like it.  It’s just that when you invited m e out for my birthday and said that it would be something really special, I thought you  might take me somewhere else.

Russell:  Is that why you wore that nice new dress?  You t hought I was taking you to a fancy restaurant, with tablecloths, mood lightin g, and snooty waiters.

Nadia:  Well…

 Russell:  This is much better, don’t you think?  We get to  sit in this comfortable booth, listen to the jukebox, and watch our food being  cooked behind the counter.  I can’t think of a better dining experience.  Don’t you agree?

Nadia:  Uh, sure.

Russell:  And don’t think you’re not getting something special for your birthday.  I planned it all ahead of time.

Nadia:  You did?  Really?  What is it?

This episode is called “Packing Clothes for a Trip.”  It’s a dialogue between Nick and Mariah using vocabulary you would associate with trave l and clothing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nick:  Aren’t you done packing yet?  We need to leave for the airport in 15 minutes.

Mariah:  I’m almost done.  I just need to finish packing  my garment bag.

Nick:  You’re bringing a garment bag?  What for?

Mariah:  For my dresses, of course.  I don’t want them t o get wrinkles in them.  I have a bag for shoes, belts, handbags, and other accessorie s; two suitcases for clothes, swimsuits, underwear, and socks; and a carry-on for m y makeup and toiletries.

Nick:  What do you need all that for?!

Mariah:  I’m preparing for all contingencies.  You neve r know what situation you’ll be in when you travel, and I want to be equipped wit h anything I’ll need.

Nick:  I should have expected this when I married a clothe s horse.  I’m surprised you didn’t bring your entire wardrobe.

 Mariah:  I was thinking about it.  I’m sure I can make r oom.  All of my bags are expandable.

[end of dialogue]

Nick asks Mariah, “Aren’t you done packing yet?”  “Aren’t you done” meaning aren’t you finished packing yet.  “To pack” (pack) means to  put things in a box or a bag or a suitcase – which you could also call luggage – especially for traveling. So if you are going on a trip, you need to put clothi ng and other things in some sort of bag or suitcase so that you can carry it.  Nick says, “We  need to leave for the airport in 15 minutes (we need to go to the airp ort in 15 minutes).”

Mariah says, “I’m almost done (I’m almost finished).  I just need to finish packing my garment bag.”  A “garment” (garment) is, in the ge neral sense, a piece of clothing, something you wear.  Here, “garment bag” is a special kind of suitcase that is used for dresses or formal jackets that a man or a woman might wear. The top of the garment bag has a “hangar,” which is t hat y-shaped thing you put your clothes on when you put them in a closet for example .  So, a garment bag is used for transporting your clothes so they don’t get all wrinkled in the suitcase. We’re going to talk about “wrinkled” in a moment.

Nick says, “You’re bringing a garment bag?  What for?” m eaning why.  Mariah explains, “For my dresses, of course.  I don’t want them t o get wrinkles (wrinkles) in them.”  A “wrinkle” as a noun, or the verb “to wrin kle,” means in this case to have these lines – thin lines in the material of the clo thing when it isn’t put into the suitcase properly.  When, for example, you would take a shirt and instead of folding it, that is instead of making it smaller and fl at in a neat way, you would take it and just roll it up in a ball and throw it in  your suitcase.  Well, that’s going to result in wrinkles.  So, it’s when your clothing isn’t straight or flat.  “Wrinkle” has a couple of different meanings, and those can be fou nd in the Learning Guide.

Mariah is taking a garment bag so her dresses don’t get w rinkles in them.  She says, “I have a bag for shoes (what she wears on her fee t), belts,” a long piece of leather or fabric that you put around your waist, usual ly to hold up your pants.  So a man would have a belt; I wear a belt with my pants so  they don’t fall down – that would be embarrassing!  “Belt” has a couple of dif ferent meanings, and those, once again, are in the Learning Guide.  So, M ariah has a bag for shoes, belts, handbags, and other accessories.  A “handbag” (han dbag – one word) is also called a “purse.”  It’s a bag that a woman has in h er hand or over her shoulder that she puts her money and her wallet and her  makeup and all sorts of

 mysterious things that men never understand.  That’s called  a handbag. “Accessories” are anything you wear in addition to your basi c clothing (a shirt, pants, a dress), anything extra that makes you, perhaps, loo k more beautiful. Never makes me look more beautiful!  It’s not necessarily a  piece of clothing.  It could be the belt, it could be a hat, it could be a p iece of jewelry.  All of these are possible accessories.

Mariah says she’s also bringing two suitcases for clothes, swimsuits, underwear, and socks.  A “suitcase” is the same as luggage.  We talked a bout a suitcase in the first sentence of the dialogue.  “Swimsuits” are clot hing that you wear while you go swimming.  For a man, it’s usually just a pair of shorts.  For a woman it could be either a one-piece or a two-piece swimsuit; the  two-piece is usually called a bikini.  There’s a part on the top and then t here’s a part around the bottom.  A one-piece swimsuit is just one piece of mate rial that is not broken or separated in the middle.  So you can’t see the woman’s st omach in a one-piece swimsuit, and in a two-piece swimsuit you can – even if you  don’t want to!

Underwear is also something Mariah is bringing.  “Under wear” is what you wear underneath your shorts or pants or dress that covers the bot tom middle.  It covers all of those things that you should keep covered in pu blic!  “Underwear” actually has a broader meaning; it’s not just what you wo uld put on underneath your shorts or dress.  It could also refer to things that yo u would put on your breasts if you are a woman – bras, that is.  It also inclu des just about any kind of clothing you put on underneath another piece of clothi ng.  So a T-shirt, a plain white shirt that you might put on underneath a more f ormal shirt, that would also be considered underwear.

Finally, Mariah says that she has a carry-on (carry-on) for her makeup and toiletries.  A “carry-on” is a small piece of luggage –  a small bag or suitcase – that you can take onto the plane with you.  That is, you don’t have to put it underneath the plane.  When you put luggage undernea th the plane, we say that you have “checked” your luggage.  A carry-on is a bag or a su itcase that you take with you to your seat, putting it either above you or in front of you underneath the seat in front of you.  “Makeup” is what typically women pu t on their faces to make them more beautiful.  “Toiletries” (toiletries) refer s to things that you would use to clean yourself – soap.  It might also include toothpaste.   It might include creams and lotions, other liquid things, typically, that you pu t on your face or body for cleansing or to make them look better.

Nick says, “What do you need all that for (why do you need  all of those things)?!” Mariah says, “I’m preparing for all contingencies.”  A “ contingency” (contingency)

 is a dangerous, difficult situation that might happen i n the future, something you need to be prepared for.  Here in Southern Californ ia we have to be prepared for the contingency of an earthquake, it could happen in the future.  Mariah is preparing for all contingencies, all the things that cou ld go wrong.  She says, “You never know what situation you’ll be in when you tr avel, and I want to be equipped with anything I’ll need.”  “To be equipped”  (equipped) means to have all the necessary things, supplies and tools, for example, that  you need for a particular situation.  We might even say you are “well e quipped.”  Sometimes we use that expression in talking about the capabilities, in tellectual for example, of someone.  It might even refer to training or education  they have received.  We hope the lawyer is well equipped to defend a man accused  of, or said to have committed, a murder.

Nick says, “I should have expected this when I married a cloth es horse.”  A “clothes horse,” like the animal, (two words) is a person  who likes clothing and has too much clothing.  It’s definitely usually a negative way of describing someone.  Nick says, “I’m surprised you didn’t bring your ent ire wardrobe.”  In this case, “wardrobe” (wardrobe) refers to all of your cl othes, all of shoes, all of your accessories.  Everything related to clothing that you ow n, that is your wardrobe.  Someone might say, “When I get a new job I ’m going to have to buy a whole new wardrobe,” meaning all of my clothes need to  be different.

Mariah says, “I was thinking about it (I was thinking abo ut bringing my entire wardrobe she means).  I’m sure I can make room.”  “To make room” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to arrange, to put things in  a certain area so that you have enough space for something else.  You could also ma ke room for a person, for example, in a crowded elevator.  Mariah says that a ll of her bags are expandable.  “Expandable” means you are able to increase  something in size.  It comes from the verb “to expand,” which means to make bigg er.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nick:  Aren’t you done packing yet?  We need to leave for the airport in 15 minutes.

Mariah:  I’m almost done.  I just need to finish packing  my garment bag.

Nick:  You’re bringing a garment bag?  What for?

 Mariah:  For my dresses, of course.  I don’t want them t o get wrinkles in them.  I have a bag for shoes, belts, handbags, and other accessorie s; two suitcases for clothes, swimsuits, underwear, and socks; and a carry-on for m y makeup and toiletries.

Nick:  What do you need all that for?!

Mariah:  I’m preparing for all contingencies.  You neve r know what situation you’ll be in when you travel, and I want to be equipped wit h anything I’ll need.

Nick:  I should have expected this when I married a clothe s horse.  I’m surprised you didn’t bring your entire wardrobe.

Mariah:  I was thinking about it.  I’m sure I can make r oom.  All of my bags are expandable.

This episode is called “Making Quick and Slow Decisions.”  It ’s a dialogue between Courteney and Dante; they’re going to be tal king about some business decisions that they need to make.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Courteney:  Which of these vendors do you think we should g o with?

Dante:  I’m really hesitant to make a decision until we’ ve pondered the options a little longer.  We don’t want to make any rash decisions.

Courteney:  We’ve sat on this for long enough, don’t you  think?  I know you’re of two minds about whether we should be switching vendors in  the middle of the year, but I think it’s the right move.  We had sound re asons for doing this, remember?

Dante:  Yes, yes, I know that it wasn’t a split-second deci sion, but whether it’ll really save us money is debatable.

Courteney:  I have to disagree with you there.  We’ve bo th seen the reports and I don’t think there are any ifs, ands, or buts about it.  We’re going to save money.

Dante:  Okay, I’m willing to make a tentative decision to  go with GreatDeal Corp. as our new vendor, as long as that decision isn’t set in sto ne.  We’ll revisit this decision in six months to see if they’re working out.

Courteney:  I can live with that.  Now, can we discuss my ra ise?

 Dante:  Raise?  That’s definitely something I’ll need t o ponder a lot more.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Courteney asking Dante, “Which of these vendors do you think we should go with?”  A “vendor” (vendor) is a  company that sells things to other companies instead of directly to you, the consume r.  So if you are a business and you need to buy paper, you would buy paper fr om another company that makes paper.  So, that’s when a vendor is.  At the end of Courteney’s question she says, “Which of these vendors do you  think we should go with?”  This is an interesting, two-word phrasal expr ession; “to go with” means to choose a particular a particular product or a particu lar service, to choose to have or use this thing.  You can use this for almost any cas e where there is a choice between two or more things.  Someone says, “Do you  like the chicken or the beef?” and you say, “Oh, I’ll go with the beef.”  That is what I am selecting.

So, Courteney wants to know which vendor they are select ing.  Dante says, “I’m really hesitant to make a decision until we’ve pondered t he options a little longer.” “I’m really hesitant” means that I don’t want to do som ething.  I don’t want to make this decision because I’m not sure; I need to think ab out it some more. “Hesitant” comes from the verb “to hesitate” (hesitate) which means the same thing, not to do something.  There’s an expression: “H e who hesitates is lost,” meaning if you hesitate often you will lose the opport unity to do something.  This is especially true when it comes to romance and trying to f ind a romantic partner. If you see a beautiful woman across the room and you hesi tate, well, someone else may get to her first.  Unless, of course, she’s marrie d; in that case you should find another room!

Dante is hesitant to make a decision until we’ve pondere d the options.  “To ponder” (ponder) is another way of saying to think about  something very seriously, to consider something.  He wants to ponder the  options a little longer – a little more time.  He says, “We don’t want to make an y rash decisions.” Something that is “rash” (rash) is something that is done  or decided very quickly, so quickly that you may easily make a mistake.  That’s “rash”  as an adjective. “Rash” has some other meanings in English, and those you ca n find in this episode’s Learning Guide.

Well, Dante is hesitant but Courteney is not.  She says, “ We’ve sat on this for long enough, don’t you think?”  “To sit on (something) ” here means to spend a lot of time thinking about something before you make your de cision.  It can also be

 used sometimes to mean to purposely not take any action to  prevent something from happening.  So your friend asks his mother if the t wo of you can go to a movie, and your friend’s mother says, “Well, I need to th ink about it.  I’ll tell you tomorrow.”  We could say she’s sitting on that decision; she’s not making the decision because she really doesn’t want you two to be go ing to the movies together.

Well, Courteney thinks they have sat on the decision about  the new vendor long enough.  She says, “I know you’re of two minds about whet her we should be switching vendors in the middle of the year.”  “To be o f two minds” means to be undecided, to be able to see the positive things – the advantages of one option but also the advantages of another option and you can’t decide.  That’s to be of two minds.  “To switch” means to change from one thing to another, to stop using this and start using that.  “I used to jog outside, and then I switched to a treadmill,” which is a machine that goes around that al lows you to run or walk inside.  That’s to switch.

Courteney says Dante is of two minds about whether they sh ould be switching vendors (changing vendors) in the middle of the year.  “B ut, she says, “I think it’s the right move (the right decision; the correct decision).   We had sound reasons for doing this,” she says.  When you say, as an adjective, so mething is “sound,” you mean it’s logical, it’s rational, it is something th at you have thought about for a long time and it makes sense, it’s correct.

Dante says, “Yes, yes, I know that it wasn’t a split-second de cision.”  A “split- second decision” is a decision made very quickly, without havin g a lot of time to think about it.  Dante is saying that this decision was not  a split-second decision. But, he says, he’s not sure if will really save them money.  He says, “whether it’ll really save us money is debatable.”  Something that is “de batable” is something that you can have more than one opinion about; there i sn’t a definite answer, different opinions could be correct; it is something th at you need to discuss more. “Debatable” comes from the verb “to debate,” which is t o argue or talk about something with two people having different opinions.

Courteney says, “I have to disagree with you there.”  The  “there” here means with what you just said.  “I have to disagree with you th ere.  We’ve both seen the reports (the information) and I don’t think there ar e any ifs, ands, or buts about it.” This is an interesting expression: “there are no ifs, ands,  or buts about it.”  This means that there are no reasons for not doing somethin g, there aren’t any reasons for not doing something, there’re no excuses.  Yo u may be going to the store with your friends, and your husband says, “I want you  home by 10:00

 tonight.  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.”  Of course, who listens to husbands, right?

Courteney says that they are going to save money, and ther e are no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Dante says, “Okay, I’m willing to make a t entative decision.” Something that is “tentative” is something that isn’t yet  final; it’s still something you could change later.  It’s almost like a temporary decisi on; you’ll make a final decision later.  Dante says that they are going to go wi th (they are going to select) GreatDeal Corp. (GreatDeal Corporation) as our  new vendor, as long as that decision isn’t set in stone.  The expression “to be set (set) in stone” means to be final, to be clearly determined, clearly agreed upon .  You can’t change it anymore – to be set in stone.  He says, “We’ll revisit thi s decision in six months.” “To revisit” in this case means we will think about this de cision again; we will analyze, discuss, and consider our decision again in six months.   Dante wants to see if this new vendor is going to work out.  “To work o ut” is a two-word phrasal verb that means to be successful, to do what they say they ar e going to do.  This actually is an expression that has different meanings in En glish, and those are, of course, in the Learning Guide.

Courteney says, “I can live with that.”  “To live with ( something)” in this case means to be able to accept a situation even though it’s d ifficult or it’s not exactly what you want; to be able to handle a situation, we m ight also say to be able to tolerate to a situation.  Courteney says, “I can live with  that (I can live with that decision).  Now, can we discuss my raise?”  A “raise” (rais e), as a noun, in this case means an increase in the amount of money that you ma ke – that a company pays you to do a particular job.

Courteney wants a raise.  Dante says, “Raise?  That’s defin itely something I’ll need to ponder a lot more,” meaning he is not going to make a decision about giving her more money until he has more time to think about it.  Sounds like my boss!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Courteney:  Which of these vendors do you think we should g o with?

Dante:  I’m really hesitant to make a decision until we’ ve pondered the options a little longer.  We don’t want to make any rash decisions.

 Courteney:  We’ve sat on this for long enough, don’t you  think?  I know you’re of two minds about whether we should be switching vendors in  the middle of the year, but I think it’s the right move.  We had sound re asons for doing this, remember?

Dante:  Yes, yes, I know that it wasn’t a split-second deci sion, but whether it’ll really save us money is debatable.

Courteney:  I have to disagree with you there.  We’ve bo th seen the reports and I don’t think there are any ifs, ands, or buts about it.  We’re going to save money.

Dante:  Okay, I’m willing to make a tentative decision to  go with GreatDeal Corp. as our new vendor, as long as that decision isn’t set in sto ne.  We’ll revisit this decision in six months to see if they’re working out.

Courteney:  I can live with that.  Now, can we discuss my ra ise?

Dante:  Raise?  That’s definitely something I’ll need t o ponder a lot more.

# Picking a Fight

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 21: Picking a Fight.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 621.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s episode is a story about a man who goes to a bar,  and there is another man at the bar who wants to fight him.  Sounds exciting !  Let’s get started. > I was sitting at my local bar waiting for my friends to a rrive to watch the game. Two guys sitting a few seats away kept giving me strange loo ks, and one of them said, “What are you looking at?”  I looked around to ma ke sure that he was speaking to me, and before I could respond he said, “Yo u want a piece of me? You and what army?  Let’s take it outside.”
> By this time, I realized that this guy was trying to pick a fight with me and I wasn’t sure what to do.  I was hoping that I could make peace w ith him or at least hold him off until my friends got there.
> I said to him, “I’m just sitting over here minding my ow n business.  I’m not trying to get in your face.  I don’t have a problem with you.   Let’s just chill out and I’ll buy you and your friend a drink.”  He didn’t seem to like  what I’d said.
> “Chill out?” he said.  “I don’t need to chill out.  T hose are fighting words.  Let’s take this outside.  I want to see you running with your t ail between your legs.”  He got up and started to walk toward me.
> Just then, my friends arrived.  When the man saw my six frie nds walking toward me, he stopped in his tracks.  I think he was weighing hi s odds and doubting his own chances.  He turned around and said something to his friend, and then they both got up and walked out the door.
> Our story begins with me sitting at a local bar.  A “lo cal bar” would be a bar in my neighborhood, close to where I live.  A “bar” is, of co urse, a place where you can go and get beer and other alcoholic drinks.

I’m waiting at the bar for my friends; we are going t o watch the game.  I don’t say which game; it could be a baseball game, a football g ame, and so forth.  It’s popular in the United States for men, in particular,  to go to what are called “sports bars,” and these are bars that have big televisions that  you can watch sporting events on.

Two guys – two men – are sitting are sitting a few seats away.  They kept giving me strange looks, meaning they kept looking at me, they co ntinued to look at me for a long time with strange looks.  The expression on t heir faces, the way they held their body, it was unusual, odd, strange.  Final ly, one of them said to me, “What are you looking at?”  This expression – this question  could be just a way of asking someone what they are looking at, but it’s the way that you pronounce it that changes the meaning.  There’s a difference between  “What are you looking at?” and “What are you  looking at?”  In the second case, “What are you  looking at?” it’s meant to express a kind of anger.  You think t he other person is looking at you in some critical way, that the other person doesn ’t like you and so you want to defend yourself.  It’s the sort of thing you wo uld say if you wanted to fight someone.  So you wouldn’t want to say this to, say, someone  who is bigger and stronger than you.

Well, this man at the bar doesn’t like me – in the stor y, that is.  I say that I look around to make sure that he is speaking to me, and befo re I can respond he says, again another expression that you would use to start a  fight, “You want a piece of me?”  This is another way of saying do you want t o fight me.  “You want a piece of me?  You and what army?”  “You and what ar my?” is another informal phrase showing that you don’t believe that the other pe rson can beat you in a fight, that this person would need other people – a l ot of other people.  It can be used for anything, not just a fight, any situation wher e you don’t think the person is able to do what they say they can do.  Finally this man  says, “Let’s take it outside.”  “To take (something) outside” is another info rmal expression used to indicate that you want to fight – to physically fight thi s other person.  You want to leave the bar, or leave that room and go outside and h ave a fight.  So, all three of

 these expressions are ones that you would find in situatio ns where someone was trying to pick (pick) a fight.  “To pick a fight” means to try to get another person to fight you, especially someone who isn’t really bothering you, someone who just wants to leave themselves alone, but you’re so angry you feel like fighting someone.  This doesn’t happen to me, but apparently to some men it does.

By the way, the expression “to take (something) outside,”  or words in that expression, can be used in other ways in English.  Take a l ook at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

I continue the story by saying, “By this time (meaning by the time this has happened), I realized that this guy was trying to pick a f ight with me and I wasn’t sure what to do.  I was hoping that I could make peace w ith him.”  “To make peace” (peace) means try to calm down a difficult situatio n, a tense situation, to perhaps forgive the other person so that there are no l onger any bad feelings between you.  I tried to make peace with him, or I was hoping to make peace with him, or at least hold him off until my friends go t there.  “To hold (someone) off” is another two-word phrasal verb meaning to delay someone, to prevent someone from doing something for a certain length of time, usually until something else happens.  This could also be used in a mili tary situation.  The famous group of Spartans in ancient Greece, the soldiers from Sparta, held off the Persians at Thermopylae to allow the Athenians to b uild a better defense and defend the city of Athens.  “Go tell the Spartans, you p asserby, that here, obedient to their word, we lie.”  That is a famous li ne written about the Spartans who died at Thermopylae by one of the great poets of t hat day.  A “passerby” is someone who is just walking by.  And so the soldiers are sa ying go tell the Spartans (our people back in our city of Sparta) that he re (at Thermopylae), obedient to their word (meaning we are doing what t hey asked us to do), we lie. In this case, their bodies are there – they lie there.  “Go tell the Spartans, you passerby, that here, obedient to their word, we lie.”  This has nothing to do with our episode, but it does have to do with the expression “to hold (someone) off.”

Well, I’m hoping to hold off these two men until my friends arrive, so I say to the man, “I’m just sitting over here minding my own business.”   “To be minding your own business” means that you are not bothering anyone el se; you are not interfering or paying attention to anyone else, you ar e just focusing on yourself.  I say that I’m not trying to get in your face.  “To get in  (someone’s) face” is an informal expression meaning to bother, to annoy, to ma ke another person angry often by asking them personal questions or perhaps standing  too close to them. I say that I don’t have a problem with you.  “Let’s just chill out.”  “To chill out” is a phrasal verb meaning to relax, to be calm.  It’s very in formal.

 I tell him that I will buy him and his friend a drink,  but he’s angry.  He says, “Chill out?  I don’t need to chill out.  Those are fighting words.”  In other words, those are things you would say when you want someone to figh t you.  “You want a piece of me?  Let’s take it outside.  What are you lookin g at?”  Those are all examples of fighting words.  Well, this gentleman thinks that telling him to chill out is an invitation to fight.  He says, “Let’s take thi s outside.  I want to see you running with your tail between your legs.”  The expressio n “your tail (tail) between your legs” means that you are scared and frightened, sor t of like a dog who’s running away.  You are a coward; you are not brave.

Then, my friends arrive, and when the man sees my friends he stops in his tracks (tracks).  “To stop in your tracks” means to immediately stop  what you are doing, to stop moving often because you are surprised or shocked.  Well, this man stops in his tracks.  Then I say, “I think he was weighing his odds and doubting his chances.  “To weigh (weigh) your odds” means to think a bout whether you are going to be successful or not, to determine whether you will be able to do what you want to do.  This man is now seeing my six friend s, doubting that he can beat me.  He turns around and says something to his fr iend, and then they leave.

Finally I say, “That was a narrow escape.”  A “narrow escap e” is when you get away from a dangerous or difficult situation without be ing harmed, without injury. But you almost got injured, it was very close – it was a n arrow escape.  I say that I had never been so happy to see my friends as I was at th at moment.  “Needless to say, the first round was on me.”  The expression “need less to say” means it is so obvious I don’t have to say it.  A “round,” in this case , is alcoholic drinks that are purchased by someone; usually one person buys everyone in  the group a beer or a drink.  When everyone in your group orders a drink at approximately the same time, we would call that a “round of drinks.”  So you may have a first round, and then you may have a second round, and a thir d round, and a fourth round.  Well, you should probably stop after maybe the third round!

I say that the first round is on me.  When you say somethin g is “on you,” or “on me,” you mean that I, or you, am going to pay for it.   You say, “Oh, no.  That’s on me.  Dinner is on me.”  I’m going to pay for dinner;  I’m inviting you to dinner. There are actually some other ways of using the prepositio n “on,” especially this saying “on me” or “on you.”  Those can be found in our L earning Guide.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

 [start of story]

I was sitting at my local bar waiting for my friends to a rrive to watch the game. Two guys sitting a few seats away kept giving me strange loo ks, and one of them said, “What are you looking at?”  I looked around to ma ke sure that he was speaking to me, and before I could respond he said, “Yo u want a piece of me? You and what army?  Let’s take it outside.”

By this time, I realized that this guy was trying to pick a fight with me and I wasn’t sure what to do.  I was hoping that I could make peace w ith him or at least hold him off until my friends got there.

I said to him, “I’m just sitting over here minding my ow n business.  I’m not trying to get in your face.  I don’t have a problem with you.   Let’s just chill out and I’ll buy you and your friend a drink.”  He didn’t seem to like  what I’d said.

That was a narrow escape.  I had never been so happy to see my friends as I was at that moment.  Needless to say, the first round wa s on me.

# Having Well- and Badly-Behaved Children

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 22: Having Well- and Badly-Behaved Children.

This episode is a dialogue between Josephine and Ray tal king about children who behave – who act in a nice way, and sometimes in a no t nice way.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Josephine:  Hello.

Ray:  Hi, Josephine, it’s Ray.  We have a meeting today at  10 a.m. and I was wondering if you would mind if I brought my kids with me.  Their babysitter didn’t show up.

Josephine:  Oh, sure.  That’s no problem.  Your children  are so well-behaved. Even at their age, they have impeccable manners.

Ray:  Well, they’re not always little angels, but they’re  not too much of a handful, thank goodness.

Josephine:  You know what they say: Girls are made of sugar  and spice and everything nice…

Ray:  It is probably a little easier with two girls.  I  feel sorry for my mother who raised six boys.

Josephine:  Six boys!

 Ray:  Yeah, and before we were born, my father though t that children should be seen but not heard.  Was he in for a rude awakening!  We were all very unruly. Imagine six boys only one year apart.  We got yelled at a lot for being naughty.

Josephine:  But that’s how boys are, aren’t they?  Girls a re different.  They’re quiet, sweet, and even-tempered.  What’s that noise?

Ray:  That noise is my daughters creating a ruckus fightin g tooth and nail over a toy.  So much for quiet, sweet, and even-tempered!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Josephine answering the teleph one, “Hello.”  Ray says, “Hi, Josephine, it’s Ray (meaning this is Ray calling you).   We have a meeting today at 10 a.m. (10 o’clock in the morning) and I was w ondering if you would mind if I brought my kids with me.”  “I was wondering ( I wasn’t sure) if you would mind (meaning if you care; if it’s important to you; i f it bothers you) if I brought my kids (my children) with me.  Their babysitter didn’t show up.”  A “babysitter” is someone who watches your children while you go and have a nice dinner and a movie.  The expression “to show up” means to arrive, to go  to some appointment that you have, to be somewhere that you are supposed to be.

Well, the babysitter didn’t show up, didn’t come to Ray’ s house, and so now he needs to bring the children to his business meeting.  Josep hine says, “Oh, sure. That’s no problem.  Your children are so well-behaved.”   To be “well-behaved” (behaved) means that you act in a way that is nice, that follows the rules, that doesn’t bother other people.  Typically, it’s a way that we would describe children, not adults.  But, you can say “That child is ver y well-behaved,” meaning they don’t yell, they don’t scream, they are very polite.  Josephine says that Ray’s children are well-behaved.  “Even at their age,” sh e says, “they have impeccable manners.”  “Even at” in this case means surprisin gly.  Their age is obviously young, and yet they still have good manners.  “M anners” describes the way that you act, the way that you behave.  “Impeccable” m eans perfect, no problems.  Someone with impeccable manners is someone who  always says the right thing, who does the right thing, who’s never rud e, who is always polite.

Ray says, “Well, they’re not always little angels, but they’ re not too much of a handful, thank goodness.”  Ray says his children are not alw ays “little angels,” that would be a child who behaved perfectly.  An “angel ” is a spirit in many religions that is usually described as being good, as being  perfect.  Unless, of course, it’s a bad angel, that would be what we would call a devil.  That’s also

 what we call some of the children who live near my house!   But, back to the story: Ray says his children are not always perfect, “they’re n ot always little angels, but they’re not too much of a handful.”  When  we say something is a “handful” (handful) we mean they are a lot of work or  it is a lot of work, something that is difficult to manage.  They’re not much – or too  much of a handful, thank goodness.  By the way, “handful” has some other meanings that you can find in our Learning Guide.  The expression “thank goodness” is u sed to show your appreciation, your gratitude when you want to thank some one.  Often we use it to express relief, meaning you think something bad is going t o happen, and then it doesn’t.  We say you are relieved, you are happy the bad  thing didn’t happen. Well here, Ray says, “thank goodness,” thank goodness that h is children are well-behaved.  He’s appreciating, or he is thankful for that.

Josephine says, “You know what they say: Girls are made of su gar and spice and everything nice.”  “Girls are made of sugar and spice  and everything nice” means that little girls never cause problems.  Ray says, “It  is probably a little easier with two girls.”  Ray obviously has two girls.  He sa ys, “I feel sorry for my mother who raised six boys.”  “To feel sorry for (someone )” means that you are sympathetic; you feel sympathy, you feel sad or bad about  a difficult situation that this other person is in.

Josephine says, “Six boys!”  Ray says, “Yeah, and before we wer e born, my father thought that children should be seen but not heard.”  This is an old expression: “Children should be seen (you can see them) but  not heard (you shouldn’t be able to hear them.”  In other words, the  children should be quiet; they should not talk.  Ray says that his father, unfortunat ely, was in for a rude awakening.  Something that is “rude” is something that is not nice, something that is unpleasant.  An “awakening” is when, literally, you wake up; you’re sleeping and then you wake up.  A “rude awakening,” th en, would be something that surprises you, something very negative.  You thought i t was going to be positive, but then suddenly you find out that it is very un pleasant.  It’s an unpleasant surprise, a not nice surprise.

Ray says that he and his brothers were all very unruly.  “To  be unruly” (unruly) means difficult to manage, difficult to keep calm, uncon trollable.  Again, it’s a way you might describe children, but you could also use this ad jective to describe a group of adults who are acting or behaving very badly, yel ling and shouting and so forth.  It’s often used to describe a crowd – a larg e group of people who are behaving badly, kind of like at a British soccer game – som ething like that!  Ray says, “Imagine six boys only one year apart,” meaning that o ne was born, for example, in 1955, the next one was born in 1956, the  next one was born in 1957,

 and so forth.  They’re only one year apart – one-year di fference in their ages.  He says that he and his brothers got yelled at a lot for bei ng naughty.  “To yell (yell) at (someone)” means to shout at them, to say very negative  things to them. “Naughty” (naughty) is a somewhat old-fashioned word in American English; it means to behave badly.  Typically we use this in describing  children – small children who are not well-behaved.

Josephine says, “But that’s how boys are, aren’t they?  Gir ls are different. They’re quiet, sweet, and even-tempered.”  “To be sweet ,” in describing a person, could mean that they are nice, they are kind, th ey are pleasant.  “Sweet” has several other meanings in English, those can be found in the Learning Guide.  “To be even-tempered” means that you are very ca lm, you don’t get very excited.  You’re not very happy, you’re not very sad; you’re sort of very calm and relaxed.  That’s even-tempered (tempered).

Then Josephine says, “What’s that noise?”  Ray says, “That n oise is my daughters creating a ruckus fighting tooth and nail over a toy.”  So the two daughters are making noise; they’re creating a ruckus (rucku s).  A “ruckus” is a noisy, confusing situation.  Often it’s related to an arg ument – a fight that two people are having.  It could be used to describe adults as well as children. “What’s all this ruckus in here?” a father might say to hi s sons who are in their room fighting about something.  That never happened t o me, of course!

Ray says that the girls are fighting tooth and nail (nai l).  This expression, “tooth and nail,” means very strongly, perhaps violently, maybe th ey’re hitting each, but with a lot of strength – a lot of effort.  Usually it ’s used with the verb “to fight.”  It could be used to describe, for example, a company that is fighting tooth and nail to survive.  They’re fighting very hard – they’re working ve ry hard to survive.  Ray finally says, “So much for quiet, sweet, and even-tempere d!”  “So much for (something)” is a phrase that we use jokingly to show that  something that you thought that was true is not true, or that there isn’t  very much of something when you expected there to be a lot of something.  It’s used, we would say, sarcastically.  Ray is saying here that the daughters are not  the way Josephine described girls, they’re not quiet, sweet, and even-tempe red.  Right after they finished talking about how nice girls are, of course, the  girls have a fight.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Josephine:  Hello.

 Ray:  Hi, Josephine, it’s Ray.  We have a meeting today at  10 a.m. and I was wondering if you would mind if I brought my kids with me.  Their babysitter didn’t show up.

Josephine:  Oh, sure.  That’s no problem.  Your children  are so well-behaved. Even at their age, they have impeccable manners.

Ray:  Well, they’re not always little angels, but they’re  not too much of a handful, thank goodness.

Josephine:  You know what they say: Girls are made of sugar  and spice and everything nice…

Ray:  It is probably a little easier with two girls.  I  feel sorry for my mother who raised six boys.

Josephine:  Six boys!

Ray:  Yeah, and before we were born, my father though t that children should be seen but not heard.  Was he in for a rude awakening!  We were all very unruly. Imagine six boys only one year apart.  We got yelled at a lot for being naughty.

Josephine:  But that’s how boys are, aren’t they?  Girls a re different.  They’re quiet, sweet, and even-tempered.  What’s that noise?

Ray:  That noise is my daughters creating a ruckus fightin g tooth and nail over a toy.  So much for quiet, sweet, and even-tempered!

# A Hit-and-Run Accident

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 23: A Hit-and-Run Accident.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 623.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Flora and Saul.  Th ere has been a car accident.  One car – one automobile has hit another one  and then immediately left.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Flora:  What happened to my car?!

Saul:  I saw it happen.  A car came around the corner a nd hit the back of your car.

Flora:  Didn’t the driver stop?

Saul:  No, it was hit-and-run.  The driver just took of f.  He was driving like a bat out of hell.  It looks like he caused some damage.

Flora:  Some damage?!  My car is totaled.  I hope whoe ver it was gets his license revoked.  Better yet, I hope the judge throws the book a t him and he does jail time.  But how are the police going to catch someone wh o leaves the scene of the crime like this?  That guy must be a real jerk!

Saul:  Take it easy.  Maybe he just panicked.  It’s probabl y his first offense. Maybe he’s young and just learning how to drive.

Flora:  Maybe…Hey, why are you defending the driver?

Saul:  Well…

 Flora:  You know the person driving the car, don’t you ?  You’re not an innocent bystander.  You’re trying to talk me out of calling the police!

Saul:  Well, I have this nephew who sometimes borrows my car, and he drives too fast.  He did hit your car, but it’s a simple fender  bender.

Flora:  Fender bender?!  My car is totaled.

Saul:  I’m sure it’s not as bad as it looks.  If you don ’t call the police, I’ll make sure it’s repaired.  It’ll be as good as new.

Flora:  Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?

Saul:  No, not at all.  I’ll get your car fixed, righ t after I wring my nephew’s neck!

[end of dialogue]

Flora begins the dialogue by saying, “What happened to my car?!”  Saul said, “I saw it happen (whatever happened, he saw it).  A car cam e around the corner and hit the back of your car.”  So, a car was driving on one street, then turned right or left and started to drive down another street .  He came around the corner, and then he hit the back of Flora’s car.

Flora says, “Did the driver stop?” meaning did he stop t his car and get out to see if he had hit anything.  Saul says, “No, it was hit-and- run.”  “Hit-and-run” is a type of car accident where one driver hits a person or hits ano ther car and then leaves immediately, without stopping to see if he has hurt any one or damaged the car because he doesn’t want to get in trouble with the pol ice perhaps or he doesn’t have car insurance, which is required in most states in the U.S.  It’s illegal to hit a car and then leave immediately.  Hit-and-run accidents i n most states will cause you to go to jail if the police find you, so you’d never  want to do that.  Well, that’s what this driver did.

Saul says, “The driver just took off.”  “To take off” is a  two-word phrasal verb meaning to leave a place very quickly, without saying goodbye .  “Take off” actually has several meanings in English; take a look at the  Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Saul says that this driver w as driving like a bat out of hell.  This is an old expression.  A “bat” (bat) is an  animal that flies at night, can bite you, and is often found in dark places.  “Hell”  is the word we describe the place where you go if you are not good in this world – after you die, that is.  So, “a bat out of hell” means that the bat was going very q uickly.  Perhaps the bat is

 escaping hell, I’m not sure.  But it’s an old expression that means to go very quickly and dangerously.  “He was driving like a bat out of  hell.”  It’s an informal expression; it’s not something you would use among childre n perhaps.  I used to hear this expression growing up; it was more common, I sup pose, a few years ago, but you will still hear it.  Saul says that it loo ks like he caused some damage.  The driver caused some damage to Flora’s car.  “ Damage” is when you break something or harm something – injure a person pe rhaps.  It’s something that makes the object in worse condition.  Usually “damag e” is about a thing, not a person, although you could say “I damaged my hand,” bu t you would more likely say “I hurt my hand” or I “injured my hand.”  But you wouldn’t say “I injured my table,” you would say “I damaged my table” or “I dama ged my car.”  So that’s what happened here; the man cause some damage.

Flora says, “Some damage?!  My car is totaled.”  Somethi ng that is “totaled” in this case means completely destroyed, ruined, something you ca n no longer fix, you can no longer use.  We usually use this word in talking  about cars.  “The car was in an accent and it was totaled,” meaning you could n ot fix the car.  Flora says, “I hope whoever it was (whoever hit her) gets his li cense revoked.”  “To revoke” (revoke) means to cancel some official permission tha t you have, or a license.  In the U.S., each state has it’s own driver’s li cense, and you must get a driver’s license from at least one state to drive in the U .S.  If you have an international driver’s license that’s okay, too.  “To revoke  a license” then means that the state says you can no longer drive, we are taking  away your license – we’re revoking it.  Flora says, “Better yet, I hope the judge throws the book at him and he does jail time.”  A “judge” is the person in an  official court of law, where you go if you have committed a crime.  The judge typically determines what your punishment will be.  Flora says she hopes the judge thro ws the book at him. This expression, “to throw the book at (someone),” means t o punish someone very severely, very badly, maybe saying that they committed man y crimes and must spend many years in jail – in prison.  That’s to thr ow the book at someone. Usually we use this when we are talking about a judge; i t could be used in talking about, for example, a principal – the head of a school who has to punish students.  It’s possible.

Well, Flora hopes the judge throws the book at this per son, and that the person does jail time.  “To do jail (jail) time” means to spe nd time in prison – to spend time in jail because you have done something wrong; you h ave broken the law, we would say, you did something against the law.  Flora is, of course, very angry. She says, “But how are the police going to catch (going t o find) someone who leaves the scene of the crime like this?”  The “scene (scene) of the crime” is where the crime happened, where it was committed.  A “crime” is, of course,

 what you do that is against the law.  To steal is a crime ; to kill someone is a crime.  So, the scene of the crime is where the crime hap pened.  Flora doesn’t think the police could find someone who has left the scene  of the crime.  Then she says, “That guy must be a real jerk!”  A “jerk” is an in formal way of calling someone a very stupid or bad person.

Saul says, “Take it easy (meaning calm down, don’t be so excited).  Maybe this man was just panicked.”  “To be panicked” means that you ar e afraid, that you are very anxious, you don’t know what to do.  You often do the wrong thing when you panic.  Saul says, “It’s probably his first offense,” me aning it’s probably the first time that this person has had a problem, has broken  the law, has committed a crime.  He says, “Maybe he’s young and just learning how  to drive.”

Flora says, “Maybe.”  Then she says, “Hey, why are you defe nding the driver?” “To defend (someone)” means to do something or say someth ing that protects the other person, to say the other person is not guilty,  they’re innocent.  Saul says, “Well…”  Flora says, “You know the person driving the car, don’t you?” She thinks Saul knows who the driver is – the name of the  driver.  Flora says, “You’re not an innocent bystander.”  A “bystander” is some one who just happens to be somewhere and see something that has happened.  It’s a person who did not do anything wrong, but they usually saw someone who did do something wrong or were in the same place as the person who did something wrong. “Innocent” is the opposite of “guilty,” meaning you didn ’t do anything wrong.  But Flora doesn’t think Saul is an innocent bystander.  She says, “You’re trying to talk me out of calling the police!”  “To talk (someone) out of (something)” means to convince or persuade another person not to do something,  to make them change their mind about doing something.  “The parents trie d to talk their daughter out of getting a tattoo.”  They tried to convince her not to p ut ink permanently on her skin.  Something you should never do for your boyfriend or  girlfriend, because someday, perhaps, they will not be your boyfriend or girl friend any longer.  I’m not speaking from personal experience, mind you!

Well, Flora says that Saul is trying to talk her out of calling the police.  Saul says, “Well, I have this nephew who sometimes borrows my car, an d he drives too fast. He did hit your car, but it’s a simple fender bender.”  So Saul’s nephew, which is the son of his sister or brother, borrowed Saul’s car and  hit Flora’s car.  He was the person who caused the accident.  But Saul says it’s not  a serious accident; it’s a “fender bender,” a minor car accident, not serio us.

Flora says, “Fender bender?!  My car is totaled.”  I shou ld explain that the “fender” is the front part of your car that usually is wh at hits another car first.  “To

 bend” means to take something that is straight and mak e it so that it is not straight.  So, a “fender bender” would be taking your fender, which is straight, and making it so that it isn’t straight because you hit i t.

Flora says, “Fender bender?!  My car is totaled.”  Saul says, “I’m sure it’s not as bad as it looks.  If you don’t call the police, I’ll make  sure it’s repaired (I will do what is necessary to repair it).  It will be as good as ne w.”  “As good as new” means just like new, as if the damage had never happened .

Flora says, “Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?”  “To pull a fast one on (someone)” means to trick them, to fool them, to make t hem believe something is true that isn’t true.  Saul says, “No, not at all (I’m not trying to pull a fast one on you).  I’ll get your car fixed (repaired), right after  (or immediately after) I wring my nephew’s neck!”  “To wring (wring) (someone’s) neck” lite rally means to choke or strangle someone by putting your hands around their neck.  The neck is, of course, what connects your head to the rest of your body.  “To wring someone’s neck” would mean basically to kill them.  Now of course, Sa ul isn’t going to kill or strangle his nephew, even if he wants to.  It’s a phrase we use to emphasize our anger at someone, to show how mad we are: “If I find the person who hit my car, I’ll wring his neck.”  Or a wife might say, “If my husban d doesn’t come back in an hour, when he does I’ll wring his neck.”  You see, it’s something you would not use about a boss or in a formal situation.  It’s used to express a great deal of anger.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Flora:  What happened to my car?!

Saul:  I saw it happen.  A car came around the corner a nd hit the back of your car.

Flora:  Didn’t the driver stop?

Saul:  No, it was hit-and-run.  The driver just took of f.  He was driving like a bat out of hell.  It looks like he caused some damage.

Flora:  Some damage?!  My car is totaled.  I hope whoe ver it was gets his license revoked.  Better yet, I hope the judge throws the book a t him and he does jail

 time.  But how are the police going to catch someone wh o leaves the scene of the crime like this?  That guy must be a real jerk!

Saul:  Take it easy.  Maybe he just panicked.  It’s probabl y his first offense. Maybe he’s young and just learning how to drive.

Flora:  Maybe…Hey, why are you defending the driver?

Saul:  Well…

Flora:  You know the person driving the car, don’t you ?  You’re not an innocent bystander.  You’re trying to talk me out of calling the police!

# Advantages and Disadvantages in Life

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 24: Advantages and Disadvantages in Life.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 624.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Advantages (which are things that help you in some situation) and Disadvantages (things that hurt you) in Li fe.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Andy:  Doesn’t it make you sick?  We bust our butts around here and the boss brings in his nephew to be the new manager.

Nia:  You never know.  He may be a good boss.

Andy:  I doubt it.  He’s getting this opportunity just b ecause he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.  He didn’t have to pull himsel f up by his bootstraps like the rest of us.

Nia:  I’m going to wait and see how he is as a manager .  I’m hoping to be pleasantly surprised.

Andy:  If you’re a blue blood like he is, born into pri vilege and old money, you can do no wrong.

Nia:  That’s not true.  He’ll be held accountable for how this department performs.

Andy:  But when does somebody like me get a break?  Okay, I  was born on the wrong side of the tracks.  I grew up in a white trash ne ighborhood.  So what? I’ve worked hard to get where I am now.  That guy hasn’ t paid his dues like I have.

 Nia:  You can complain all you want, but it doesn’t chan ge the situation.  He’s the new boss and we work for him.  Get used to it.

Andy:  Get used to it?!  Not on your life!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Andy saying to Nia, “Doesn’t it  make you sick?”  The expression “to make (someone) sick” in this context means to b ecome very angry, to cause very negative emotions in someone.  When yo u see something that you think is very wrong you would say, “That makes me si ck,” or “It makes me sick to think there are children who need food in th is world and don’t have it.” There are a couple of different meanings, however, usin g the words of this expression; those can be found in our Learning Guide.

Andy says, “We bust our butts around here and the boss bri ngs in his nephew to be the new manager.”  The expression “to bust (bust) you r butt (butt)” means to work very hard, to do a lot of work.  Your “butt” is tha t which you sit on; it’s an informal term that is short for “buttocks.”  “To bust” usu ally means to break, and so basically you’re saying you’re working so hard.  However, t he boss brings in his nephew to be the new manager.  The “nephew” woul d be the son of the boss’ brother or sister.

Nia says, “You never know,” which is a general expression me aning you may be wrong, we don’t know.  “He may be a good boss,” this nep hew.  Andy says, “I doubt it.”  Andy is upset because he thinks that one of t he employees should be promoted to manager – should be made manager because  they have been working very hard in the company.  Andy says, “He (this ne phew) is getting this opportunity because he was born with a silver spoon in hi s mouth.”  This is an old expression; “to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth”  means that you were born into a rich family; you grew up in a family that had a lot of money.  It’s usually used to make some sort of negative comment about a person, how they don’t deserve what they have or how they have not worke d very hard.  Andy says that this nephew of the boss’ didn’t have to pull himse lf up by his bootstraps like the rest of us.  This is another old, but common expression : “to pull yourself up (meaning to lift yourself up) by your bootstraps.”  Your  “bootstraps” are literally little round holes that you use to put on your boots; t hey’re in the back of the boot on the bottom.  But the idea of the expression is that you work very hard to improve your situation in life, you work very hard to get  better even though you don’t have very much money or a lot of things to help you  – you don’t have a lot

 of advantages.  Andy says that everyone else in the company h ad to work hard to get what they have; they had to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

Nia says, “I’m going to wait and see how he is as a man ager.”  She’s saying we should wait and see what happens.  “I’m hoping to be p leasantly surprised.”  “To be surprised” means that you are not expecting certain thi ngs to happen. “Pleasantly” means nicely.  So “to be pleasantly surprised”  is to have something unexpected happen that you like.

Andy says, “If you’re a blue blood like he is, born into p rivilege and old money, you can do no wrong.”  Some more expressions here to tal k about social and economic advantages of some people versus others: “blue blo od” refers to a person who belongs to the richest, most wealthy part of a  society – the most powerful, the most respected.  We would call it the “u pper class.”  “Privilege” (privilege) is another word for advantage, something t hat you have that no one else has.  It’s also, for example, used in talking about t hings that you can do if you are a member of a certain group: “One of the privi leges of being a member of the golf club is that you get to play golf for free.”  Well, you don’t have to pay for each game; you have to pay for your membership.  So, privi lege is another word for advantage.  Again, it is often used to describe socia l or economic advantages. “Old money” refers to money that has been in your family for a long time, wealth that your family has had for many years.  Here in the Un ited States, the Rockefeller family would be perhaps considered a family of  old money – not perhaps, they definitely would be!  The Ford family – F ord Motor Company – money has been in their family for many years, many gen erations: the grandfather, the great-grandfather, and so forth.  S o, old money refers to a rich and powerful family that has been rich for many years.

Andy says if you’re a blue blood like this nephew, and you are born into privilege and old money, meaning when you are born you receive im mediately these advantages, you can do no wrong.  The expression “to do n o wrong” means that you are unable to make a mistake.  It also means, more commonly, that when you do make a mistake no one will pay attention; it will  be forgiven or ignored by other people.  Some parents think their children can do  no wrong, so when someone complains to them about their children – for e xample children who are yelling and screaming in the street – when someone compl ains, some parents will say, “Oh, that wasn’t my child, that is impossible.”  Their child can do no wrong.  Well let me tell you, they can!

Moving on: Nia says, “That’s not true.  (The nephew) wil l be held accountable for how this department performs.”  The expression “to hold (someone) accountable”

 means to make someone responsible and accept the results or  consequences of his or her actions.  Basically, it’s another way of saying you  will be punished or rewarded based on what you do.  So if you do a good jo b you’ll be rewarded, but if you do a bad job you will be punished.  Maybe you’ll  lose your job.  That’s to hold someone accountable.

Andy says, “But when does somebody like me get a break?”  “T o get a break” means to get an opportunity to do something, to have som e good luck and to be finally able to do something you want to do.  We often  talk here in Los Angeles about actors and actresses getting a break in the movies or in television; they get the opportunity to work and show how good they are – or  how bad they are! Andy says, “Okay, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks.”   This old expression, again pretty common, “to be born on the wron g side of the tracks” (tracks), means to born in a bad part of the town or cit y where you live.  People who are poor, who don’t have nice houses, where there’ s a lot of crime; this would be the wrong side of the tracks.  “Tracks” here ref ers to the railroad tracks. And railroads, like modern highways and freeways were of ten built in cities and divided the city.  And often on one side of that divide there were people who were poor, and on the other side were people who had more  money.  That’s true here in Los Angeles in some ways.  The major east-west freeway – the 10 freeway, the Santa Monica freeway – does divide the wealthy north  part from the poorer south part, at least in some parts of the city.

So, Andy says he was born on wrong side of the tracks.  “I g rew up,” he says, “in a white trash neighborhood.  So what?”  “White trash ” is an informal and somewhat rude – somewhat not nice phrase to refer typical ly to someone who is white (who is Caucasian), who is poor, has very little e ducation, doesn’t have a good job or does have a job at all.  White trash is a pretty insulting term to refer to someone in that condition.  Andy, however, somewhat u sually describes himself this way, and then he says, “So what?” which is a phrase we use to say that something is not important.  “I don’t have a deg ree from Harvard.  So what?” You’re saying it doesn’t matter; I don’t care.  Andy says t hat he’s worked hard to get where he is now.  “That guy (meaning the nephew) hasn’t paid his dues like I have.”  The expression “to pay your dues” (dues) means to spend a long period of time working in a job that is not very well paid, th at is perhaps not very important.  You do that for a long time so that event ually you will end up with – you will wind up with – you will get a better job at  the end of working so hard at these not so important jobs.  That’s to pay your dues.

Nia says, “You can complain all you want (all you’d like), but it doesn’t change the situation.  He’s the new boss and we work for him.  Get used to it.”  “To get

 used to” (used to – two words) means to become accustomed to something, to see something as normal, as common, as ordinary.  I’m tryin g to get used to the silence outside where I am recording, because school has s tarted and all the lovely children are back in school.  That’s a wonderful thi ng!  Here in the United States, we have what is called “compulsory schooling,” you must go to school between the ages of 6 and 16 approximately.  It’s a won derful thing for me!

Andy says, “Get used to it?!  Not on your life!”  This is a  common expression; informally we say “not on your life” to mean that somet hing is impossible, something will never happened under any circumstances.  “ Are you going to go to John’s party?”  You say, “Not on your life,” meaning absolutely not, that will never happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Andy:  Doesn’t it make you sick?  We bust our butts around here and the boss brings in his nephew to be the new manager.

Nia:  You never know.  He may be a good boss.

Andy:  I doubt it.  He’s getting this opportunity just b ecause he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.  He didn’t have to pull himsel f up by his bootstraps like the rest of us.

Nia:  I’m going to wait and see how he is as a manager .  I’m hoping to be pleasantly surprised.

This episode is called “Being Famous and Anonymous.”  “Ano nymous” is the opposite of “famous,” no one knows who you are.  Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Erik:  Why are you wearing that getup?

Juliana:  I’m trying to stay under the radar.  I don’t want to create a mob by going outside without a disguise.  People are going to recog nize me.

Erik:  So?  Are you trying to tell me that you think you’ re famous after being in one play?

Juliana:  Of course!  I’ve had my name in lights and I ha ve to expect people to know who I am.  Losing my privacy is the price of fame.  E verybody knows that.

Erik:  I think you may be overestimating the size of your ad oring public.  How many people went to see your play?

Juliana:  Enough.  By tomorrow, the newspapers will ha ve my picture plastered across their pages and I’ll have to say good-bye to my anon ymity.

Erik:  If the papers don’t come out until tomorrow, wh y are you going around incognito?

Juliana:  I’m just getting ready to meet my fans.

Erik:  Depending on whether the reviews are good or ba d, you may be famous – or infamous.

 [end of dialogue]

Erik begins our dialogue by asking Juliana, “Why are you we aring that getup?” “Getup” (getup – one word) is an informal way to say a n unusual set of clothing, an unusual what we might call “outfit” (outfit).  You r outfit refers to the clothes that you are wearing.  I could talk about my shirt, my pants, a nd my shoes as being part of my outfit.  My dress could be part of my outfit.  Well not my dress, I mean…well, you know what I mean!  Well, a getup is a ver y unusual outfit, something strange that someone is wearing.

Juliana says to Erik, “I’m trying to stay under the radar ( I’m wearing this getup to stay under the radar).”  This expression means to not be noticed, or to be unnoticed, not to draw attention to yourself.  “He’s tr ying to stay under the radar,” he doesn’t other people to pay attention to him.  Juli ana, who apparently is normally famous and people know who she is doesn’t want p eople to recognize her.  She says, “I don’t want to create a mob by going outside without a disguise.”  A “mob” (mob) is a large group of people, often people who are angry or are very emotional about something, and they’re tog ether in one place and they are making noise or they are causing problems.  That’ s a mob.  “Mob” actually has a couple of different meanings in English; none of them are explained in the Learning Guide however.  But you will  get an explanation of the word “getup.”  That does also have additional explanati ons that are in the Learning Guide.

So, Juliana doesn’t want to create a mob by going outsi de without a disguise.  A “disguise” (disguise) is something that changes the way you l ook so that people don’t know who you are.  “People,” Juliana says, “are go ing to recognize me (they’re going to identify me if I don’t wear this di sguise).”  Erik says, “So (meaning so what, why is that important)?  Are you tryin g to tell me that you think you’re famous after being in one play?”  “To be famous ” means that you are very well known; people know who you are.  If you walk down  the street, they’ll say, “Hey, there’s Lucy Tse!  I saw her picture on the Interne t.”  Really?  Well, it’s just an example.  So, Juliana thinks that she’s going to be fa mous because she was in a “play,” which is a performance – a public performa nce at a theater typically. You could be in one of Shakespeare’s plays for example.

Well, Juliana says that she is in fact famous because she was i n a play.  She says, “Of course!  I’ve had my name in lights and I have to  expect people to know who I am.”  The expression “to have your name in lights” means literally that your name is being displayed typically on a large board – a la rge area in front of a

 theater so that people can see your name, people know who is performing in that play or movie.  That’s to have your name in lights, to be  a famous actor or actress and for people to know who you are because you’ve ha d your name in lights.  She says, “I have to expect people to know who I  am.  Losing my privacy is the price of fame.  Everybody knows that.”  Your “privacy ” (privacy – what in Britain they would pronounced as privacy) refers to keepin g information about yourself secret, not letting other people know about you r personal information. “Fame” (fame) means being famous, it’s when people know  who you are.  That’s to have fame.  There was a popular television show many ye ars ago called Fame about young students who were trying to become famous in the world of dance and theater.  There was a song from that show that ma ny people would recognize: Remember my name.  Fame!  I’m gonna live forever.  I’ m going to learn how to fly.  High!  “Remember my name,” meaning I am going to be famous.  “Fame!  I’m going to live forever.”  The idea  is that if you are famous people will always know who you are, even after you die.   “I’m going to live forever.  I’m going to learn how to fly.  High!”  If you could learn how to fly by yourself, you would definitely be famous – and I don’t mean smoking marijuana people!

Back to the dialogue: Juliana thinks that she is now famou s.  Erik says, “I think you may be overestimating the size of your adoring public.”   “To overestimate” means to think something is bigger or larger than it re ally is.  “To adore” (adore) someone is to show them a lot of love.  So, “adoring p ublic” refers people who would love you, your “fans,” people who think that you a re a celebrity.

Erik says, “How many people went to see your play?”  Juliana  says, “Enough,” sufficient numbers to be famous.  She says, “By tomorrow (b efore tomorrow), the newspapers will have my picture plastered across their page s and I will have to say good-bye to my anonymity.”  When we say something is “pla stered” (plastered) in this context we mean displayed in many plac es, easy for people to see because it is everywhere.  Here in Los Angeles when the re is a new movie, many times the movie companies will put up big signs annou ncing the movies. They plaster them everywhere – they put them everywhere.  “Plastered” has a very different meaning – a couple of different meaning s, and those can be found in the Learning Guide.

Well, Juliana thinks that she’s going to be famous, and t herefore she will have to say good-bye to her anonymity.  “Anonymity” (anonymity) mea ns that no one knows who you are, to be anonymous in other words.  She’s saying that I will no longer be anonymous; people will know me.  Erik says, “If  the papers (meaning the newspapers) don’t come out until tomorrow (meaning  they won’t be published

 – they won’t be released until tomorrow), why are you g oing around incognito?” “Incognito” (incognito) is another way of saying in disgu ise, without letting people know who you really are.

Juliana says, “I’m just getting ready to meet my fans,” the  people who love me so much.  Erik says, “Depending on whether the reviews are go od or bad, you may be famous – or infamous.”  “Reviews” here refers to an a rticle in a newspaper or a magazine that tells why someone likes or didn’t like a p articular book, or TV show, movie, song, restaurant, play.  Reviews are any descr iptions of someone’s opinion about a certain thing.  People often look at the reviews for books and movies before buying them; they want to know what other  people think.  Well, Erik says that depending on whether the reviews of the pl ay are good or bad, you may be famous if they are good reviews, or if they are ba d reviews you will be infamous (infamous).  “To be infamous” means to be fam ous in the sense that you are well-known, but for bad things that you have don e.  Everyone knows who you are, but they know about the bad things you did.  S o if you say someone is infamous, you mean that they are well-known but they ar e well-known for having done something wrong or something bad.  A similar wor d would be “notorious” (notorious), which is the same thing, to be famous for so mething that is bad or negative typically.  Although, I’ve noticed in recent years many people using notorious to mean the same as famous instead of infamous,  so the meaning is changing in the language, but the dictionary definitio n would tell you that it is being famous for something bad.

We hope you’re not famous for anything bad.  In either  case, even if you are, let’s listen now to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Erik:  Why are you wearing that getup?

Juliana:  I’m trying to stay under the radar.  I don’t want to create a mob by going outside without a disguise.  People are going to recog nize me.

Erik:  So?  Are you trying to tell me that you think you’ re famous after being in one play?

Juliana:  Of course!  I’ve had my name in lights and I ha ve to expect people to know who I am.  Losing my privacy is the price of fame.  E verybody knows that.

 Erik:  I think you may be overestimating the size of your ad oring public.  How many people went to see your play?

Juliana:  Enough.  By tomorrow, the newspapers will ha ve my picture plastered across their pages and I will have to say good-bye to my an onymity.

Erik:  If the papers don’t come out until tomorrow, wh y are you going around incognito?

Juliana:  I’m just getting ready to meet my fans.

Erik:  Depending on whether the reviews are good or ba d, you may be famous – or infamous.

# Wiring Money to Another Country

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 26: Wiring Money to Another Country.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 626.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Wiring Money (or sending money el ectronically) to Another Country.”  It’s dialogue between Mahmoud and Sharon using a lot of vocabulary you would need to know in sending wires.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mahmoud:  My brother emailed about an emergency situati on.  He needs $300 by tomorrow, but how can I get cash to him within 24 ho urs if I’m here in Mexico City and he’s in New York?

Sharon:  That’s easy.  You can wire him the money from here and he can pick it up immediately there.

Mahmoud:  You mean wi re him money through the bank?  I already checked with my bank and it’ll take at least five days for them to proce ss the wire.

Sharon:  You can just use a private wire service like We stern Union and the money will be available to him immediately.  I wire m oney all the time using Western Union.  Here is a blank form.  I can help you fi ll it out if you want me to.

Mahmoud:  That would be great.  Hey, this form is for a money transfer.  Is that the same thing as a wire?

Sharon:  Yes, it’s the same thing.  Fill out the receive r or recipient information here and the sender information there.

Mahmoud:  Can I pay in local currency?  I don’t have tha t much cash in U.S. dollars.

 Sharon:  Sure.  When you go to the Western Union off ice, they’ll calculate how much you’ll have to pay according to the current exchange rate.

Mahmoud:  Is there a fee?

Sharon:  Yeah, there is, and it’s a little higher if you want the money to be available immediately.  If you have more time, you could save a little by using the slower service that makes the money available in three busi ness days.  All done?

Mahmoud:  Yeah, I think so.  Now what?

Sharon:  Now you take this to the nearest Western Union office.  They’ll give you a copy of this form with a control number.  Your brothe r can use that control number to pick up the money from any Western Union office  in New York.

Mahmoud:  Sharon, you’re a lifesaver.

Sharon:  So, what’s the emergency?

Mahmoud:  Tickets go on sale tomorrow for my favorite ba seball team.  My brother and I have to get tickets.

Sharon:  That’s the emergency?!

Mahmoud:  For us, it’s a matter of life and death.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Mahmoud saying, “My brother em ailed about an emergency situation.”  “Emergencies” are unexpected situati ons or events, things that require that you have an immediate response; you ha ve to take care of them right away because they are very serious or dangerous.  Mah moud says that his brother needs 300 dollars “by tomorrow,” meaning befor e the end of tomorrow. He asks, “how can I get cash to him within 24 hours if I’ m here in Mexico City and he’s in New York?”  So our dialogue today is in Mexico Ci ty.  “Cash” is money that you put in your wallet or your purse.  It usually consists of either “coins,” round metal objects, or piece of paper we call “bills” ( bills).  The term is used more generally to mean money.

Mahmoud is wondering how he can get this money to his br other in one day if they are in different cities.  Sharon says, “That’s easy.  You can wire him the

 money from here and he can pick it up immediately there .”  “To wire” as a verb means to send something, usually money, electronically; it could also mean sending someone a message.  In the old days, we had tele graph messages that were sent electronically.  With the Internet and better  phone service we don’t do that very much.  I don’t think they do it all anymore; I  might be wrong about that. But nowadays the word is used to refer to sending money e lectronically either through a bank directly or through another private comp any such as Western Union, which we’ll talk about in a minute.  The word “wire” has several meanings in English, and those can be found in, of course, our Le arning Guide.

So Sharon says that Mahmoud can wire his brother money.  Mahmoud says, “You mean wire him money through the bank?  I alrea dy checked with my bank and it’ll take at least five days for them to process the wire.”  “To process” is a general verb meaning to do all the necessary actions, oft en things that require what we would call “paperwork” – forms to fill out, p ermissions to get.  To process, for example, an application means that you look at  it, you give it to the appropriate people, they review it, they give it back to you, and so forth.  So, taking care of the ne cessary steps is what this verb is meant to convey – is meant to communicate to you.

Mahmoud says that it will take at least five days to wire m oney through his bank. That, by the way, is generally true internationally; it takes a longer time to use your bank to wire money, a longer time than a private service and that’s what Sharon recommends.  She says, “You can just use a privat e wire service like Western Union and the money will be available to him i mmediately.”  “Western Union” is the name of a company that lets you send money electronically almost anywhere in the world, and the person you are sending it can pick it up usually within a day, sometimes less.  Sharon says, “I wire money all the time using Western Union.  Here is a blank form.”  Boy, Sharon is p retty amazing; she actually has the form for wiring money to Western Union  with her!  I guess she carries those around.  Anyway, she gives him a blank form.  A “blank form” would be an empty form, one that doesn’t have anything writte n on it yet.  So the place where you put your name is empty – it’s blank; in genera l “blank” means empty. “Blank” has a couple of other meanings however, and those  are also in our Learning Guide for this episode.

Sharon says, “Here’s a blank form.  I can help you fill it  out if you want me to.” “To fill (something) out,” or “to fill out (somethin g)” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to write or type information where it is requ ested on a form.  So, when you come to the United States you have to fill out a fo rm for a visitor: you need to put your name, the country where you live, where you are going in the U.S., how

 long you will be there, and so forth.  That’s to fill out something or to fill something out – to put the information onto the docum ent, paper, or form.

Mahmoud says, “That would be great.  Hey, this form is for a money transfer.  Is that the same thing as a wire?”  “Yes” is the answer.  A “money transfer” is money sent electronically from one person to another; it is the same as a wire. Sharon says, “Yes, it’s the same thing.  Fill out the re ceiver or recipient information here and the sender information there.”  She’s obviously pointing or indicating on the form where Mahmoud should put this i nformation.  There are two kinds of information: the first is for the recipient .  A “recipient” (recipient) is someone who receives something, someone who gets somethin g from someone else.  If you give someone a gift, the person you give t he gift to is the recipient. Or you could win, for example, a prize; we would talk ab out the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.  Those are the people who have receive d prize.  The recipient of the money is Mahmoud’s brother.  Mahmoud i s the person sending the money, and so we call him the “sender.”  Remember in English we sometimes add an “er” at the end of a verb to make it the person who does that thing.  “To play” becomes “player” when we talk about t he person who plays, and so forth, and that’s what is going on here.

Mahmoud says, “Can I pay in a local currency?”  “Currency”  is the type of money that you use in a particular country.  In the United St ates we use the dollar, in most of Europe – Western Europe they use the euro, in Ja pan they use the yen, and so forth.  “Local currency,” then, is the currency of the place where you are sending your money.  Mahmoud wants to know if he can pay i n local currency, meaning can he pay in Mexican pesos even though the pers on is going to pick up the money in dollars, and the answer, of course, is yes.   Sharon says, “Sure (meaning yes).  When you go to the Western Union office,  they’ll calculate how much you’ll have to pay according to the current exchange rate.”  “To calculate” means to add, subtract, multiply, or divide; that is, to use mathematics, or math, to find the answer to something.  The “exchange rate” i s the price of one currency in another currency.  It’s what, for example, if  you come to the United States with a euro – one euro, and you go to a place –  a bank where they exchange money (they give you the local currency of that count ry), they would give you say $1.20 or $1.30 – 1 dollar and 30 cents.  Tha t’s the exchange rate – that’s the price of a dollar in euros or the price of a  euro in dollars.

Mahmoud says, “Is there a fee (fee)?”  A “fee” is the am ount of money that you pay a business, an organization, or the government for a  particular purpose.  If you want to, for example, play golf at a public golf co urse – a government-owned golf course in Los Angeles – you have to pay a fee.  That’ s money that you pay

 for that particular thing.  This is somewhat different than taxes; “taxes” are usually a percentage of some other amount of money that you either make or spend.  A fee is a particular price of doing something t hat only that one person would pay.

Sharon says, “Yes, there is  (a fee), and it’s a little higher if you want the mo ney to be available immediately.”  If you are sending money by Western Union and you want the person to be able to pick up the money today in stead of tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, they charge you more money; they charg e you a higher fee. Notice we use “high” and “low” in talking about fees be cause they represent money, which is represented or counted by numbers which ca n be high or low. “If you had more time,” Sharon said, “you could save a l ittle by using the slower service that makes the money available in three business days.”   A “business day” is typically Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Fr iday.  The weekends, Saturday and Sunday, are not considered business d ays since many businesses are closed.  So if someone says, “We will send that  to you in five to seven business days,” and today is Wednesday, they mean that th ey will send it to you not by Sunday, which is five normal or calendar days,  but five business days, which would be next Wednesday, or possibly even Friday if it is seven days.

Sharon says to Mahmoud, “All done?” meaning all finishe d – are you finished? Mahmoud says, “Yeah, I think so.  Now what (now what do I do)?”  Sharon says, “Now you take this to the nearest Western Union office.  They’ll give you a copy of this form with a control number.”  When you send a wire with Western Union they give it an official number that they use to keep tra ck of – to put it into their computer, and that control number is what you give the o ther person, the recipient.  They put that control number – it’s called a  “money transfer control number” – on the form that they fill out, and that’s how they can find it easily in the computer.  So that’s a control number specifically for a wire “via,” or using, Western Union.  Sharon says, “Your brother can use that control number to pick up the money from any Western Union office in New York.”   Western Union will also ask you for your name and your address and your phone n umber, but the control number is the most important piece of informati on.

Mahmoud says, “Sharon, you’re a lifesaver.”  When we say som eone’s a “lifesaver” we mean that person has helped us a great d eal.  They’ve saved our life – they prevented us from dying.  Of course, that’s n ot literally true – it’s not actually true, but we say that when someone has helped u s a great deal: “You’re a lifesaver.”

 Sharon said, “So, what’s the emergency?”  Why do you need  to send this money to your brother?  Mahmoud says, “Tickets go on sale for my  favorite baseball team.”  They go on sale, meaning they will start sellin g them, tomorrow. Mahmoud says, “My brother and I have to get tickets.”  Shar on says, “That’s the emergency?!”  She cannot believe that the emergency is the  fact that Mahmoud’s brother has to buy some baseball tickets.  Mahmoud says, “F or us (meaning for my brother and me), it’s a matter of life and death.”   When you say something is “a matter of life and death” you mean it is very impo rtant, it is very serious. Sometimes you mean that literally – you mean the person could die if something doesn’t happen.  Often however, just like the term “lif esaver,” we use it as an exaggeration really, to say it’s very important, it’s very se rious.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mahmoud:  My brother emailed about an emergency situati on.  He needs $300 by tomorrow, but how can I get cash to him within 24 ho urs if I’m here in Mexico City and he’s in New York?

Sharon:  That’s easy.  You can wire him the money from here and he can pick it up immediately there.

Mahmoud:  You mean wire him money through the bank?  I already checked with my bank and it’ll take at least five days for them to proce ss the wire.

Sharon:  You can just use a private wire service like We stern Union and the money will be available to him immediately.  I wire m oney all the time using Western Union.  Here is a blank form.  I can help you fi ll it out if you want me to.

Mahmoud:  That would be great.  Hey, this form is for a money transfer.  Is that the same thing as a wire?

Sharon:  Yes, it’s the same thing.  Fill out the receive r or recipient information here and the sender information there.

Mahmoud:  Can I pay in local currency?  I don’t have tha t much cash in U.S. dollars.

Sharon:  Sure.  When you go to the Western Union off ice, they’ll calculate how much you’ll have to pay according to the current exchange rate.

 Mahmoud:  Is there a fee?

Sharon:  Yeah, there is, and it’s a little higher if you want the money to be available immediately.  If you had more time, you could save a little by using the slower service that makes the money available in three busi ness days.  All done?

Mahmoud:  Sharon, you’re a lifesaver.

Sharon:  So, what’s the emergency?

Mahmoud:  Tickets go on sale tomorrow for my favorite ba seball team.  My brother and I have to get tickets.

Sharon:  That’s the emergency?!

Mahmoud:  For us, it’s a matter of life and death.

# Being Spontaneous or Well-Planned

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 27: Being Spontaneous or Well-Planned.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 627.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.

This podcast has a website at eslpod.com.  Consider suppor ting this podcast by becoming a member, you can get more information on ou r website.

This episode is called “Being Spontaneous or Well-Planne d.”  These are opposite things, as we will learn from Mariela and Wil l.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mariela:  Wow, it looks like you’re working on a big pro ject.  What are all these pages and pages of notes for?

Will:  I’m preparing for my date with Christine.  I w ant everything to be well- planned and to go without a hitch.

Mariela:  Okay, but I still don’t understand why you’re  making such detailed plans.

Will:  I want to be ready for every contingency.  For in stance, I planned a picnic, but if it rains, I’ll take her to lunch at the Garden  Café instead.

Mariela:  Don’t you think you’re taking the spontaneity o ut of your date?  Why don’t you play it by ear?  I know you don’t like to fly by the seat of your pants, but maybe she’ll have some ideas about what she’d like to do.

Will:  Oh, I’ve taken her preferences into account.  If sh e wants to do something active, we can go bowling or take a long walk.  If she p refers something more passive, we’ll go to a movie.

Mariela:  Well, it sounds like you’ve mapped out every possi ble alternative.  Hey, what’s this?

Will:  Give me that!

 Mariela:  I see you’ve mapped out more than just your d ate.  You mapped out the entire trajectory of your life together: Get married in two years, have your first child two years after that…

Will:  That is not meant for you.  And plus, it’s just a tentative plan…

Mariela:  You mean Christine will have some say in it?

Will:  I may let her pick our children’s names.  Now, get  out of here, will ya?!

[end of dialogue]

Mariela begins by saying, “Wow, it looks like you’re workin g on a big project (a large task).  What are all these pages and pages of not es for?”  “Notes” is information that you write down sort of informally whe n you are thinking about an idea or are listening to someone.  We use the expression “to take notes,” for example at a meeting somebody takes notes – somebody writes down everything that is discussed and decided.  Or a student can  take notes in school, writing down what the teacher or professor says.

Well, Mariela sees pages and pages, which is a way of sayin g a lot of pages of notes, and wants to know what they are for – why does he have them?  Will says, “I’m preparing for my date with Christine.”  A “da te” is, of course, a romantic appointment where you meet someone you are romanticall y interested in.  He says, “I want everything to be well-planned and to go wi thout a hitch.”  “To be well-planned” means you know exactly what’s going to happe n sometime in the future.  You know what you’re going to do first, second,  and third.  Most people don’t think about romantic dates as being well-planned.   Planned perhaps, you have an idea, but well-planned gives the idea that it’ s almost going to be a schedule that you will follow.  But Will says he wants his date to go without a hitch (hitch).  “Without a hitch” means without any pro blems, without any difficulties.

Mariela says, “Okay, but I still don’t understand why you’re  making such detailed plans,” plans that include exactly everything that is going  to happen.  Will says, “I want to be ready for every contingency.”  A “contingency”  is something that might happen in the future and could change your plans because it causes problems or difficulties.  So if you have a contingency for rain when  you are planning, say, a party outside, that means that if it rains you have somet hing you’re going to do to prevent the party from being cancelled.  Perhaps you are going to move

 everyone into your garage or inside of your house or insid e of your neighbor’s house – you probably should ask them first!  That’s a conti ngency, a plan for something that might go wrong in the future.  Will sa ys, “For instance, I planned a picnic, but if it rains, I’ll take her to lunch at the Garden Café instead.”  See, if it rains he has a plan about what he’s going to do instead  of the original plan.

Mariela says, “Don’t you think you’re taking the spontane ity out of your date?” “Spontaneity” (spontaneity) is the opposite of well-pl anned; it’s doing things without planning them first, just doing them right at  that moment.  Mariela thinks that Will is taking the spontaneity out of his date, mea ning he’s eliminating.  “To take out of” means to eliminate, to get rid of.  She says, “Why don’t you play it by ear?”  The expression “to play (something) by ear” (ear)  means to be spontaneous, to have spontaneity, to decide at the moment  what you’re going to do without making plans.  This expression actually has anoth er meaning in English, and that can be found in our Learning Guide for this episode.  Mariela says, “I know you don’t like to fly by the seat of your pant s, but maybe she’ll have some ideas about what she’d like to do.”  “To fly by the seat of your pants” is another way of saying to be spontaneous, to have spontanei ty, to decide without making plans in advance.  Sometimes we use this expression  in a negative way to describe someone who should have planned but didn’t.

Will responds, “Oh, I’ve taken her preferences into accoun t.”  “Preferences” are your desires, the things that you want.  “To take (somethi ng) into account” (account) means to consider what someone else is saying or to  consider that other thing.  “To take someone’s preferences into account”  means to think about what they want and make that part of your plan.  He says,  “If she wants to do something active, we can go bowling or take a long walk.”   “Active” here means with a lot of physical movement; not just sitting or stand ing around and talking, but actually doing something, perhaps some sport or somet hing athletic.  The opposite of “active” is “passive,” this is when you just let  things happen; you don’t try to change things, you don’t get up and walk around o r do a lot of things.  Will says if his date, the women he’s going on the date with,  prefers something more passive, we’ll go to a movie.  Mariela says, “Well, it soun ds like you’ve mapped out every possible alternative.”  By the way, I should ment ion that “active” can have other meanings in English, and those you can find in  the Learning Guide. Now, “to map out (something)” is a two-word phrasal ver b which means to decide or determine something: “I’m going to map out my pla ns for tomorrow.”  I’m going to write them down; I’m going to make some decisions.  S o when Mariela says, “it sounds like you have mapped out every possible alterna tive,” she means that Will has planned for every possible alternative.  “Altern ative” is possibility, choice, or option.

 Then Mariela sees something, she says, “Hey, what’s this?”   Will says, “Give me that!”  He’s obviously angry at Mariela for taking it.  M ariela says, “I see you’ve mapped out more than just your date (what you’re goin g to do on your romantic date).  You mapped out the entire trajectory of your l ife together.”  A “trajectory” is the direction that something follows over time.  We usually use this, for example, when talking about a ball that you throw, or a rocket – a rocket engine that goes up into the sky – a missile.  The trajectory is the path that it takes. Well, it can also be used to talk about the events or thi ngs that will happen in the future in someone’s life, and Mariela sees that Will has mapped out or planned the entirety trajectory of his life together with his da te: Get married in two years, have your first child two years after that.  Of course th is is very unusual, especially since this appears to be the first date that Wil l has with this woman!

Will says, “That is not meant for you.”  “To be meant fo r” means to be intended for, with you wanting something to happen.  “This is m eant for you,” this is intended for you, I’m doing this for you.  Well, the n ote is not intended for – it’s not meant for Mariela to look at; she’s not supposed to  see it.  Will says, “And plus (meaning in addition), it’s just a tentative plan. ”  “Tentative” (tentative) means possible but not yet final, not definite, not cert ain.  This is what I think will happen but it may change – my plan may change.

Mariela says, “You mean Christine will have some say in it ?”  “To have a say in (something)” or “to have some say in (something)” means t o be participating in a decision, to have your opinions and your ideas matter in t he decision.  You’re part of the decision.  Will clearly thinks he will make mo st of the decisions.  He does say, “I may (meaning it’s possible) let her pick our chi ldren’s names,” select the names for the children.  That’s the decision that Wi ll’s date Christine will be given.  He then says to Mariela, “Now, get out of here,  will ya?!”  “Get out of here” means leave.  We use this expression “will you,” often spell ed and pronounced “will ya” (ya), to ask someone to do something.  It’s an informal, very informal way of asking someone to do you a favor – to do something for you.  “Will ya give me that pen?” meaning please give me that pen, that is what I want you to do. Will is using it at the end of the sentence, and that so metimes indicates that you are angry with the other person: “Stop talking to me, will ya?”  You’re telling the person something you don’t like about what they are doin g; you’re indicating, that is, that you are not happy.  And Will is not happy that Mariela saw this note that he wrote for himself, planning out his entire life wi th his date Christine.  Poor Christine!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Mariela:  Wow, it looks like you’re working on a big pro ject.  What are all these pages and pages of notes for?

Will:  I’m preparing for my date with Christine.  I w ant everything to be well- planned and to go without a hitch.

Mariela:  Okay, but I still don’t understand why you’re  making such detailed plans.

Will:  I want to be ready for every contingency.  For in stance, I planned a picnic, but if it rains, I’ll take her to lunch at the Garden  Café instead.

Mariela:  Don’t you think you’re taking the spontaneity o ut of your date?  Why don’t you play it by ear?  I know you don’t like to fly by the seat of your pants, but maybe she’ll have some ideas about what she’d like to do.

Will:  Oh, I’ve taken her preferences into account.  If sh e wants to do something active, we can go bowling or take a long walk.  If she p refers something more passive, we’ll go to a movie.

Mariela:  Well, it sounds like you’ve mapped out every possi ble alternative.  Hey, what’s this?

Will:  Give me that!

Mariela:  I see you’ve mapped out more than just your d ate.  You mapped out the entire trajectory of your life together: Get married in two years, have your first child two years after that…

Will:  That is not meant for you.  And plus, it’s just a tentative plan…

Mariela:  You mean Christine will have some say in it?

Will:  I may let her pick our children’s names.  Now, get  out of here, will ya?!

# Introducing a New Product

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 28: Introducing a New Product.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 628.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Lear ning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English – and yo ur looks – even faster.

This episode is called “Introducing a New Product.”  It’s a dialogue between Augie and Lillian.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Augie:  Today’s the day.  I’m giving you the heads up.  O ur company is rolling out its new line of cell phones.

Lillian:  I can see you’re excited about it.  What’s so spe cial about the new products?

Augie:  This line of phones has state-of-the-art techno logy and never-before- seen features.  It’s been in development for over a year and it’s been really hard keeping it under wraps.

Lillian:  I thought information was leaked weeks ago.

Augie:  Those were just rumors, and the company put a cl amp on those pretty quickly.

Lillian:  Wasn’t the new line supposed to come out next month?

Augie:  That was the original plan, but since McQ Corp.  is coming out with its own line of phones soon, we wanted to get a jump on t hem.

Lillian:  And steal their thunder.

 Augie:  Yes, and steal their thunder.  We had to scramb le to get the phones ready ahead of schedule, but I think it was worth it.  T hey’re really going to make a splash.

Lillian:  I hope so.  I hope all of this hype has been justified.

Augie:  Oh, it will be.  I’ll know soon enough.

Lillian:  How?

Augie:  You’ll be begging me to get you one.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Augie saying, “Today’s the day.  I’m giving you the heads up.  Our company is rolling out its new line of ce ll phones.”  To give (someone) the heads up” means to let someone know someth ing is going to happen in the future, to give someone information bef ore other people may have it; you’re letting them know early about something.  “M y friend in the accounting department gave me a heads up about how the company wa s doing this year.” He gave me some information before other people got i t.  In this case, Augie is giving Lillian the heads up about the fact that their company is rolling out its new line of cell phones.  “To roll (roll) out” is a two-wo rd phrasal verb meaning when a company introduces and begins selling a new product or ser vice.  We use this verb, “to roll out,” meaning to launch, to begin a n ew product, start selling something different.  “Line” here, as in “new line of  cell phones,” just means a new group or a new set of cell phones.  “Roll” has severa l meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lillian says, “I can see you’re excited about it.  What’s so special about the new products?”  Augie says, “This line of phones has state-of- the-art technology and never-before-seen features.”  “State-of-the-art,” with  hyphens in between each word, means very modern, very advanced, the newest and the  best technology – state-of-the-art technology.  We use state-of-the-art t ypically to talk about machines or computers, something mechanical.  “Never-befor e-seen,” also with hyphens in between the words – never-before-seen – mean s that no one has ever seen or experienced something like this; it’s complet ely new, it never existed before in the past.

Augie thinks their cell phones have never-before-seen feat ures.  He says, “It’s been in development for over a year (for more than a year) and it’s been really

 hard keeping it under wraps.”  When something is “in de velopment” we mean that it is being worked on by a company but it isn’t fini shed yet.  We use this expression a lot here in Los Angeles in talking about movi es and films, and when I say “we,” I mean people who work in films and movies – not me.  When they say “in development,” they’re referring to something tha t is not yet produced, often not even yet filmed, but something that they are working on.  In fact, there’s even an expression “a development deal” (deal), or a de velopment agreement. When one of the big media companies decides to do someth ing about a particular series or idea, they make an agreement with a  person and they develop the idea – they work on it.

Augie says that it’s been really hard to keep this new cell  phone under wraps. “To keep (something) under wraps” (wraps) means to keep something secret, not to share information about it to other people.  Lill ian says, “I thought information was leaked weeks ago.”  The verb “to leak” (leak) in this ca se means to share secret information with the newspaper or with the gene ral public or on the Internet about your company or about your organization.   Typically, it’s secret information that you are not supposed to tell anyone e lse.  There are leaks all the time of information from the government.  Somebody te lls the media – tells the newspapers about some secret, that’s called a leak.

Augie says, “Those were just rumors.”  A “rumor” is somethi ng that is unofficial, and may or may not be true but many people are talking about it.  There are rumors that Brad Pitt is considering making a movie abou t my life.  Actually, I’m starting that rumor.  If you could tell other people,  then we would have a rumor; people would be talking about it.  It’s not necessarily t rue, however.  I’ll let you guess whether it is true or not!  Augie says, “the company put a clamp on those pretty quickly.”  “To put a clamp (clamp) on (something)”  means to stop something from happening or to stop it from continuin g to happen, typically by doing something drastic – that is, with a lot of force, power, or strength.  Well, the company put a clamp on those rumors pretty, or very, quickly.

Lillian says, “Wasn’t the new line supposed to come out n ext month?”  The phrasal verb “to come out,” in this case only, means to be  released, to be introduced to something, to be made available to the p ublic.  So a company that has a new thing it is selling will say the new phone, for example, is coming out in July, meaning that’s when you can buy it – in July.

Augie says, “That was the original plan, but since McQ Cor p. is coming out with its own line of phones soon, we wanted to get a jump on them.”  “To get a jump on (someone)” means to do something before someone else does it before you,

 to do something faster or sooner than another person, o ften when you are competing with that other person.  You may decide to ge t a jump on your schooling by taking classes in the summer, when everyone else will start in the fall.  You’re doing it before everyone else.  Lillian  says, “And steal their thunder.” So, Augie is saying that their company is releasing their  phone now, before the McQ Corp. releases their new phone.  The reason, Lilli an says, is to steal their thunder.  “Thunder” is normally the sound that is made when there is a big storm and there is what is called lightning, which are very po werful electrical charges that appear sometimes in a big storm.  In this case, ho wever, “to steal (someone’s) thunder” means to take attention away from s omeone else, or to get the praise of other people before the other person can .  It’s normally something you don’t want to do, unless you don’t want to be nice to someone.  In this case, the company wants to make sure that its new product gets pu blicity before McQ Corp.’s new phone.

Augie says, “Yes, and steal their thunder.  We had to scr amble to get the phones ready ahead of schedule, but I think it was worth it.”  “To scramble” here means to do something very quickly, to do it faster than you wou ld normally do it. “Scramble,” however, has a couple of different meanings in English, and those are in the Learning Guide.  They were scrambling to ge t the phones ready “ahead of schedule,” meaning before the deadline, bef ore the day that it was supposed to be done.  If your schedule says you’re finishing  the product or the project next Tuesday, and you decide you want to finish it  on this Friday, you are finishing it ahead of schedule, before the original p lan.

Augie says the new phones are really going to make a splash  (splash).  “To make a splash” means to do something that attracts a lot of attention, that many people look at or notice.  Lillian says, “I hope so.  I h ope all of this hype has been justified.”  “Hype” (hype) is things that are said about a product that make people more interested in wanting to buy it, often before it  is even available.  You could talk about the hype over a new movie: people are talking  about it; people are saying how good it is.  Hype is always a positive thing – at  least positive things being said about this new thing that is not yet availabl e.  However, it’s also sometimes used to mean that people are exaggerating – a re saying things that are better about it than it really is.

Lillian says she hopes the hype has been justified, meaning  something that you can support, something for which there’s evidence, somethin g that shows that it really is what it says it is.  Augie says, “Oh, it will be.   I’ll know soon enough,” meaning very quickly, soon.  Lillian says, “How?”  Augie says,  “You’ll be begging

 me to get one.”  “To beg” (beg) means to plead, to ask someone to do something in a very urgent way.  “Please help me.”  You’re beggin g for help.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Augie:  Today’s the day.  I’m giving you the heads up.  O ur company is rolling out its new line of cell phones.

Lillian:  I can see you’re excited about it.  What’s so spe cial about the new products?

Augie:  This line of phones has state-of-the-art techno logy and never-before- seen features.  It’s been in development for over a year and it’s been really hard keeping it under wraps.

Lillian:  I thought information was leaked weeks ago.

Augie:  Those were just rumors, and the company put a cl amp on those pretty quickly.

Lillian:  Wasn’t the new line supposed to come out next month?

Augie:  That was the original plan, but since McQ Corp.  is coming out with its own line of phones soon, we wanted to get a jump on t hem.

Lillian:  And steal their thunder.

Augie:  Yes, and steal their thunder.  We had to scramb le to get the phones ready ahead of schedule, but I think it was worth it.  T hey’re really going to make a splash.

Lillian:  I hope so.  I hope all of this hype has been justified.

Augie:  Oh, it will be.  I’ll know soon enough.

# Being Hungry and Full

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 29: Being Hungry and Full.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 629.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Steve and Brandy abou t being hungry.  Let’s eat – I mean let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Steve:  I’m finally home and I’m hungry.  What’s for di nner?

Brandy:  I’m making a new dish.  I think you’re really g oing to like it.

Steve:  Oh, good.  Bring it on.

Brandy:  Well, I miscalculated the cooking time a little  and it’s going to take longer than I originally planned.  I know you’re famish ed.  Here’s a snack for you to munch on while you wait.

Steve:  I’m half-starved.  I skipped lunch and had to w ork late.

Brandy:  I know, but I also know you’re dying for somethin g really good.  I promise that it’ll be worth the wait.

Steve:  Okay, but I could eat a horse right now.  Bring me something else to snack on.

 Brandy:  Don’t be too greedy and eat too much.  I don ’t want you to spoil your appetite.  I know that what I’m cooking is something you’ ve been craving for a long time, and you want to save your appetite for it.

Steve:  All right.  I’ll wait.  How much longer will it be?

Brandy:  Oh, maybe another hour or a little longer…

Steve:  Another hour?!  I’ll be dead and buried by th en!

[end of dialogue]

Steve begins by saying, “I’m finally home and I’m hungry (I want to eat).  What’s for dinner?”  Brandy says, “I’m making a new dish.  I th ink you’re really going to like it.”  “Dish” here means a type of food, food that is part of what you are eating for your dinner or lunch or any meal.  “Dish” has a coupl e of meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional  explanations.

Steve says, “Oh, good.  Bring it on.”  This phrase, “brin g it on,” is used to show that you are very interested in something, you’re very anxi ous, excited about something happening; you want it to happen right away.   Sometimes it’s used in a competition, when somebody says, “I’m going to beat you  at basketball,” and you say, “Bring it on,” meaning okay, I accept your challen ge.  I think I can beat you, that’s the general idea.

Brandy says, “Well, I miscalculated the cooking time a littl e and it’s going to take longer than I originally planned.”  “To miscalculate” i s the opposite of “to calculate” in some way; it means to make a mistake in your calculations – to make a mistake in your math, in adding or subtracting.  O r in this case, really, in estimating the amount of time it will take for the f ood to cook.  So miscalculate, not actually the opposite, but really means to calculate p oorly, to do a bad job at calculating.

Brandy did a bad job of calculating the “cooking time,” the amount of time needed for the food to cook, so it’s going to take longer than she had planned.  She says, “I know you’re famished.”  “To be famished” means to be extremely hungry, to be very, very hungry.  We sometimes use this word to talk abou t a situation where a country or an area doesn’t have enough food for the peo ple to survive; we would call that a “famine” (famine).  “To be famished,” alt hough it appears to be a related word, usually just means in normal conversation to be extremely hungry, to be very, very, very hungry.

 Brandy says that she knows Steve is famished.  She says, “Here’s a snack for you to munch on while you wait.”  A “snack” (snack) is a sm all amount of food that you eat in between your meals.  Usually it’s somethin g sweet – something good to eat.  In this case, Brandy gives Steve a snack to mu nch on.  “To munch (munch) on (something)” means to eat food, sometimes ve ry noisily – very loudly, and typically it’s used when we are talking abou t snacks.  So you invite some friends over to watch a movie at your house, and you get some popcorn and maybe some pretzels, other kinds of snacks, and people watch the movie while munching on the snacks.  You’re eating the snacks slowl y, but it’s not a formal meal.

Steve says, “I’m half-starved.”  This is the same as famished;  I am extremely hungry.  He says, “I skipped lunch and had to work late.”  “To skip” (skip) means not to do something you would normally do.  “I’m going  to skip my exercise this morning because I got up late.”  I normally exercise in the morning, but because I was late I’m going to skip it today.  “Skip” has several me anings in English, all of which – well, some of which can be found in the Learnin g Guide.

Brandy says, “I know (I know that you are half-starved), but  I also know you’re dying for something really good.”  When somebody says, “I ’m dying (dying) for (something)” they mean they want something, they desire so mething a lot, with a very strong emotion.  “I’m dying for some pizza.”  I rea lly want pizza.  So, you want something very badly.  You could be dying for a new  car or dying for a new dress.

Steve is dying for something really good to eat.  Brandy says, “I promise that (the meal; the food) will be worth the wait.”  When someo ne says something is “worth the wait” (wait) they mean it’s so good that it is somet hing you’ll want to wait perhaps a long time for.  You don’t really want to wa it, but it’s so good that you will wait and you will be happy when you are able, in this case, to eat the food. But many things could be worth the wait: a movie, a bo ok that you have been waiting for to be published, and so forth.

Steve says, “Okay, but I could eat a horse right now.”  Th is is an informal expression, “I could eat a horse,” to show that you are v ery hungry and could eat a lot of food.  A “horse,” of course, is an animal that  you ride on; it’s a large animal, I think that’s the idea.  Most people don’t ea t horses actually here in the United States.  I’ve never had horsemeat.  I hear it ta stes like chicken!

 Brandy says, “Don’t be too greedy and eat too much.”  Ste ve has asked to have something else to snack on – to eat as a snack, but Brandy says, “Don’t be too greedy” (greedy).  “To be greedy” means to want too much  of something, to want more than what you actually need.  That’s to be greedy.   Brandy says, “I don’t want you to spoil your appetite.”  “To spoil (spoil) yo ur appetite” means to eat a lot of things before the main meal so that when the m ain meal comes you’re not hungry anymore.  If you have some snacks and some fruit, an d you eat some things at, say, three o’clock in the afternoon, well whe n you go to dinner at six or seven o’clock you may not be hungry – you’ve spoiled your appet ite.  “Appetite” is the desire to eat food.  “To spoil” means to ruin, t o make something go bad.

Brandy says, “I know that what I’m cooking is something you’ ve been craving for for a long time.”  “To crave” (crave) means to want somet hing very much, to want something very badly, especially food.  We talked about “I ’m dying for (something),” “to crave” means the same thing but is usu ally used when talking about food: “I crave a piece of pumpkin pie.”  Brandy says,  “you’ll want to save your appetite for” what she’s cooking.  “To save your appe tite” means you’re not going to eat something now so that later you have what we would call a big appetite; you have a strong desire to want to eat a lot  of food later.  It’s in some ways the opposite of spoiling your appetite.  You’re savi ng your appetite; you’re not eating so that you will be hungrier in the future .

Steve says, “All right.  I’ll wait.  How much longer wil l it be?”  How much longer will it take until the food is ready?  Brandy says, “Oh, maybe another hour or a little longer.”  Steve says, “Another hour?!”  He’s not very happy.  He says, “I’ll be dead and buried by then!”  This expression, “to be dead and buried,” is used to emphasize that something will take too long, so long t hat I will have died by the time it is completed.  Of course, Steve won’t actually be dead and buried; it’s just an informal way of saying a very long time.  “To bury” h ere means to put the body in the ground.  Of course, Steve should be thankful that  he has such a good wife that will spend all that time and make sure that he h as a good dinner.  Instead of complaining, he should be thanking her.  Am I right la dies, huh?  Thank you!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Steve:  I’m finally home and I’m hungry.  What’s for di nner?

Brandy:  I’m making a new dish.  I think you’re really g oing to like it.

 Steve:  Oh, good.  Bring it on.

Brandy:  Well, I miscalculated the cooking time a little  and it’s going to take longer than I originally planned.  I know you’re famish ed.  Here’s a snack for you to munch on while you wait.

Steve:  I’m half-starved.  I skipped lunch and had to w ork late.

Steve:  Okay, but I could eat a horse right now.  Bring me something else to snack on.

Steve:  All right.  I’ll wait.  How much longer will it be?

# Making a Medical Diagnosis

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 30: Making a Medical Diagnosis.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 630.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Making a Medical Diagnosis,” when you go to a doctor and he or she tells you what your medical problem is.  Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Terrell:  Where have you been?

Sally:  At the hospital, again.  My doctor is putting me  through another battery of tests.

Terrell:  She still hasn’t been able to zero in on the cause of your pain and make a diagnosis?

Sally:  No, she hasn’t.  Part of the problem is that my symptoms are intermittent, and they seem to flare up only when I’m not under obse rvation.  The symptoms themselves are ambiguous, so finding the root cause hasn’t  been easy.

Terrell:  I can see how that would be mystifying and fr ustrating.  Are you still in a lot of pain?

Sally:  The mild pain in my legs seems to be chronic, bu t the severe pain in my back is occasional.

Terrell:  I guess you’re not up for going out tonight .

Sally:  After a day of being poked and prodded like a g uinea pig, all I want to do is to curl up with a hot cup of tea and a good book!

 [end of dialogue]

Terrell begins by asking Sally, “Where have you been?”  Sally says, “At the hospital, again.  My doctor is putting me through anoth er battery of tests.”  Her doctor is putting her through, meaning making her do s ome things that are perhaps not very pleasant, not very nice, or require a lot  of work.  What she needs to go through – what her doctor is putting her through is another battery (battery) of tests.  A “battery” is a series of things, a group of things.  It’s often used with the word “test.”  A battery of tests could be  used to determine which classes you will take at an English language school.  They m ay give you a speaking test, a writing test, a listening test; we would  call those a “battery of tests.”  This is a battery of medical tests.  A few years ag o I went to the doctor because I was having problems with my allergies.  My nose w ould start to run, my eyes would water, my throat would sometimes make me coug h; all of these things were related to allergies.  So my doctor put me through a battery of allergy tests to determine what the problem was.  You can tell  today that I still have allergies because my voice is what we would say a little “ hoarse” (hoarse). When your voice is hoarse you don’t sound normal; your voice  is often lower, more difficult perhaps to understand.

That’s enough of my medical problems!  Now back to the di alogue: Sally has gone through a battery of tests.  Terrell says, “She (mea ning her doctor) still hasn’t been able to zero in on the cause of your pain an d make a diagnosis?” “To zero in on (something)” means to identify one thing , one explanation that solves a problem or that gives you an answer, eliminating all of the other possibilities.  The doctor is supposed to zero in on the ca use of Sally’s pain and make a diagnosis.  “To make a diagnosis,” or simply “to dia gnose” as a verb, is when a doctor identifies what your illness or medical pr oblem is.  Sally’s doctor has not been able to make a diagnosis.  Sally says, “No, she  hasn’t (she hasn’t zeroed in on the cause yet).  Part of the problem is tha t my symptoms are intermittent, and they seem to flare up only when I’m not under observation.”  A “symptom” (symptom) is some usually physical sign that shows yo u have some illness or disease.  So for example if your head starts to  hurt and you start to get a fever, where the temperature of your body goes up, th at is a symptom perhaps that you have some illness – some disease.  Sally’s symptoms are  intermittent. Something that is “intermittent” comes and it goes; it ’s not constant.  It will happen sometimes but then sometimes it won’t happen, so it’s difficult to determine what is going on.  “To flare up” is a two-w ord phrasal verb meaning for a disease or an illness to become worse, often without an y warning.  Suddenly my nose starts to run, I start to sneeze, I might say my alle rgies are flaring up;

 they’re getting worse suddenly.  The word “flare” has several meanings in English, some of those are found in your Learning Guid e for this episode.

Sally’s symptoms seem to flare up – get worse – only when she’s not “under observation,” meaning only when she isn’t being watched carefully.  She isn’t being monitored, we might say.  So when the doctor isn’ t looking, basically, her symptoms get worse.  “The symptoms themselves,” she continues, “are ambiguous.”  Something that is “ambiguous” has more th an one possible explanation.  It’s also a word we use to describe somethin g that is confusing, unclear, difficult to understand.  Often when somethin g could have more than one meaning and it isn’t clear which meaning is meant, we say that thing is ambiguous.  A question could be ambiguous, for example.   Sally’s symptoms are ambiguous – it’s hard to tell what they mean, so findi ng the root cause hasn’t been easy.  The “root (root) cause” of something is the m ain cause, the main reason why something is happening.

Terrell says, “I can see how that would be mystifying and  frustrating.”  When something is “mystifying” it is related the idea of a myste ry, something we don’t understand.  In more general terms, something that is confusing, something that is not clear to you.  Terrell asks, “Are you still in a lot  of pain?”  Sally says, “The mild pain in my legs seems to be chronic, but the severe pa in in my back is occasional.”  We have two different kinds of pain: we have  “mild” pain, which is not strong, not too bad, not serious; and we have “sever e” pain, which is very strong, very serious, the opposite of mild.  We also have t wo different descriptions of when this pain occurs – when it happens.  “Chronic” (chronic) pain continues for a long time, especially when it is re lated to a disease that doesn’t have a cure – there’s no way to make the illness go  away.  “Occasional” pain is pain that happens every once in a while.  Maybe  once a day, twice a day, maybe every other day, that would be occasional pain.

Sally says, “The mild pain in my legs seems to be chronic, bu t the severe pain in my back is occasional.  Terrell says, “I guess you’re not up for  going out tonight.” A couple of phrasal verbs there: “to be up for (somethin g)” means to have the energy to do something, to be interested in doing somet hing.  “To go out” means to leave your house and have a good time: go a movie, g o to a nice restaurant, have fun with someone outside your house.

Sally says, “After a day of being poked and prodded like a guinea pig, all I want is to curl up with a hot cup of tea and a good book!”  “T o be poked (poked) and prodded (prodded)” means that you are being touched ma ny times, usually by a doctor or someone who’s examining you for some medical pr oblem.  It could be

 part of a test that they are doing; they could be takin g your blood, they could be checking your temperature, lots of things that would requ ire that you are touched many times.  The idea of “poked and prodded” is that i t is somewhat painful, although it isn’t always necessarily that way.  It’s usuall y used in talking about medical exams that require a lot of tests and that requi re that you be at the doctor’s office or the hospital for a long time.  A “ guinea pig” is a small animal; it’s like a hamster.  It’s used here, however, because guinea p igs traditionally have been used in medical experiments and biological experimen ts.  It’s now a general term to talk about people who are being used to test so mething new, especially a new kind of medicine.  It’s often used in a negative way,  meaning that the person who is giving them this medicine or doing something to t hem is using them without really knowing whether that thing is going to  work or not; it’s an experiment.

Sally says, “After a day of being poked and prodded like a guinea pig, all I want is to curl up with a hot cup of tea and a good book!”  “T o curl up with” here means to relax comfortably, sitting on a couch or a sofa perhaps with a book or a magazine and/or something to drink.  “I want to curl up  with a good book” is a common expression meaning I want to go home, sit in a co mfortable chair, and read a good book.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Terrell:  Where have you been?

Sally:  At the hospital, again.  My doctor is putting me  through another battery of tests.

Terrell:  She still hasn’t been able to zero in on the cause of your pain and make a diagnosis?

Sally:  No, she hasn’t.  Part of the problem is that my symptoms are intermittent, and they seem to flare up only when I’m not under obse rvation.  The symptoms themselves are ambiguous, so finding the root cause hasn’t  been easy.

Terrell:  I can see how that would be mystifying and fr ustrating.  Are you still in a lot of pain?

 Sally:  The mild pain in my legs seems to be chronic, bu t the severe pain in my back is occasional.

Terrell:  I guess you’re not up for going out tonight .

Sally:  After a day of being poked and prodded like a g uinea pig, all I want to do is to curl up with a hot cup of tea and a good book!

# Customizing a Personal Webpage

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 31: Customizing a Personal Webpage.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 631.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Lear ning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even fast er.

This episode is called “Customizing a Personal Webpage.”  Many people have their own pages – their own websites.  We’ll talk about  some of the vocabulary that might be related to that, especially on social net working sites such as Facebook.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Keiko:  The layout of your webpage is so lame.  Why do n’t you customize it?

Al:  Why bother?  I don’t want to spend the time or the energy.

Keiko:  Let me show you my page.  Check out this background.   Don’t you think it’s great?

Al:  Yeah, it’s great.  Can I get back to my book now?

Keiko:  You haven’t even looked at my page.  Look at this.   You can add all kinds of graphics and you can use the profile editor to list i nformation about yourself: your hometown, your likes and dislikes, your relationship status, your mood, everything!  You can link to or upload photos and videos, too.  I even have a custom cursor and this scrolling text across the top

Al:  Yeah, it’s all great, but kind of dizzying.

Keiko:  You haven’t even seen my animated gifs.  This funn y baby will dance across the page, look!

Al:  Thanks for the suggestions, but I think I’ll stick to a simple, uncluttered page. How long did it take you to do all of that?

 Keiko:  How long?  Maybe a few hours.

Al:  I’d rather spend a few hours reading a good book.

Keiko:  Suit yourself.  Maybe that’s why you have 22 “frie nds” and I have 200.

Al:  Clearly your time has been better spent.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Keiko saying to Al, “The layout  of your webpage is so lame.”  The “layout” is the position of things either o n a piece of paper or here on the computer screen: where you have your photos, where yo u have your writing – your text.  The position of things on the screen or on  a page, in this case a webpage, is the layout.  “Lame” (lame) used to mean, a nd still does, someone who has injured themselves, someone who is handicapped, w ho hurt their arm or their leg.  Now it’s used more informally as meaning un interesting, boring, not cool.  “Lame” is a little bit dated now, it was more p opular I think in the 90s, but it’s still used.  Keiko says, “Why don’t you customize it?” me aning the webpage. “To customize (something)” is to change something so that i t is unique; it is unlike anything else.  Here it means also, I think, to pe rsonalize, to make the page reflect the person behind it.  That is, the page will somehow show you who this person is.

Al says, “Why bother?”  “Why bother?” is an informal phra se used to show that you think the suggestion that someone is giving you is a wa ste of time; you don’t want to do it.  You can use it by itself, “Why bother?”  or you can be more specific and say, “Why bother customizing my website?”  Notice that the verb after the word “bother” is an “ing” form.  “Why bother going to  the movies when you can watch the movie for free here on television?”  Al says, “I  don’t want to spend the time or the energy.”

Keiko says, “Let me show you my page.  Check out this backgro und.”  “Check out” means take a look at; investigate.  “Background” is t he large area of a piece of paper or a computer screen behind what you are looki ng at.  Normally it’s just white, but you could have different colored backgrounds.  The background is what everything else is on, if you will, in this case.  “B ackground” has a couple of different meanings, however; take a look at the Learn ing Guide for some additional explanations.  She says, “Don’t you think it’s g reat?”  Don’t you think my page is great Keiko means.  Al says, “Yeah, it’s great.   Can I get back to my

 book now?”  “Can I get back to” means I want to return to doing what I was doing before.  We often say it when we are trying to indicate  to the other person that they are bothering us, they are taking up our time.

Keiko says, “You haven’t even looked at my page.  Look at t his.  You can add all kinds of graphics and you can use the profile editor to li st information about yourself.”  “Graphics” are small pictures or symbols that a re used to make something more interesting looking, a design, pattern t hat also can sometimes make the writing clearer; it indicates what is going on in the writing part of a piece of paper or a page on the web.  The “profile editor ” is something that you will find in social networking websites such as Facebook or Twitter th at allows you to control the information that other people see about you.  It will allow you to select information that you want to tell other people, and who gets to see that information.  The information on this profile editor , according to Keiko, includes your hometown, your likes and dislikes, your relationship status, and your mood. Your “hometown” (one word) is the place where you were  born, the place where you grew up.  My hometown is St. Paul, Minnesota.  Your  “likes and dislikes” are, obviously, the things that you like and the things that you  don’t like.  Your “relationship status” is whether you are married; whet her you are single; whether you are dating, you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend; it could that you are engaged, you are going to get married; it could be th at you are divorced, you used to be married; or it could be that you are widowe d, your husband or wife died.  That’s your relationship status.  Your “mood” (mo od) is the way you feel at a particular moment in time.  I’m in a good mood mea ns I’m happy, I’m in a bad mood means I’m sad or angry.

Keiko says, “You can link to or upload photos and videos, t oo.”  “To link to (something)” means to make your webpage – a part of yo ur webpage such that when you click on it, it takes you to a different page or  a different part of a page. We call these “hyperlinks,” usually they are underlined on a website, and often a different color, blue is most common.  That is to link to something.  “To upload” means to put a file, like a picture or a music file, ont o another computer called a “server,” and that server is connected to the Internet so  that other people can look at or download that file.  Download is the oppo site of upload.  Upload you put it up to a server – you put it on a server; to dow nload means you take it off – you make it part of your own computer.

Keiko says, “I even have a custom cursor and this scrolling text  across the top.” Something that is “custom,” as we learned earlier with the verb “customize,” is something that is special to you, something that is unlike other things.  A “cursor” (cursor) is a special graphic on your computer screen that t ells you where the

 mouse is or where whatever you may be typing will appear.   Keiko says she has a custom cursor and scrolling text.  “Text” is just another word for words. “Scrolling” is something that moves across the screen or up and down the screen, usually somewhat slowly.  At the end of a movie or  a television program, for example, there are what are called “credits,” the list of names of all the people who worked on that movie or show, and these usually “scroll ,” meaning they move slowly.  Especially for a movie you see this more often , the names will go from the bottom of the screen slowly up to the top of t he screen almost as if they were on a wheel, turning around.  That’s scrolling text .

Al says, “Yeah, it’s all great, but kind of dizzying.”  “Di zzying” (dizzying) means something that makes you feel dizzy.  “To feel dizzy” means th at your head is sort of spinning; you are not exactly sure where you are p erhaps.  If someone hits you on the back of the head or spins you around in a  circle, around and around, you may get dizzy.  You won’t be able to walk stra ight, at least for a few minutes.  Here, “dizzying” means that it’s too complicated,  it’s too much, and it is confusing to Al.

Keiko says, “You haven’t even seen my animated gifs (or jif s).”  The word (gif) is actually an acronym.  It is a word that comes from differ ent words – the first letter of three different words; (gif) stands for graphics inte rchange format.  It’s pronounced by some people as “jif,” other people prono unce it “gif.”  I think “jif” is the original pronunciation.  In any case, it is a small f ile that is a picture or a photo or a design of some type.  “Animated” means that it is moving somehow; there is movement in the little picture.  These were ver y popular when the web first got started in the 1990s.  I remember in 1993 or  4 when I first started using the Internet you would see a lot of these.  They are no t quite as common, fortunately, anymore, but that’s what Keiko has on her w ebpage.  She says, “This funny baby will dance across the page, look!”

Al says, “Thanks for the suggestions, but I think I’ll stick t o a simple, uncluttered page.”  “To stick to” means I’m going to stay with what  I have right now, or I am going to only do this.  He’s going to stick to an unclutte red page.  “Uncluttered” means that it isn’t messy; it’s the opposite of confusing, it’s the opposite of too much, of disorder.  Uncluttered would be very simple, wit hout anything unnecessary on the page.

Al says, “How long did it take you to do all of that?”  Keiko says, “How long? Maybe a few hours.”  Al says, “I’d rather spend a few hou rs reading a good book.”  Keiko says, “Suit yourself (meaning you do what you  want to do; if that’s what you like).  Maybe that’s why you have 22 (quote unq uote) ‘friends’ and I

 have 200.”  On Facebook you can get friends, people who  are able to look at your website.  A friend isn’t necessarily a friend; it’s o ften just somebody who knows who you are.  Many people try to get as many friends as they can; that’s often a sign of what we call “narcissism,” which is the be lief that you are the most important thing in the world.  We have a lot of that  nowadays!

Anyway, Keiko has 200 friends on her social networking site,  probably Facebook, and Al only has 22.  Al says, “Clearly your time has been b etter spent.”  “Better spent” means used in a better way, in a more productive way.  However, Al is being sarcastic; he’s making a joke.  He means the opposite  of what he says. He’s saying that Keiko has wasted her time getting these webpages customized and having all of these quote unquote friends.  When we say “quote unquote” we mean in this case that they’re not really friends.  Once a gain it’s the opposite, in some ways, of what you are saying.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Keiko:  The layout of your webpage is so lame.  Why do n’t you customize it?

Al:  Why bother?  I don’t want to spend the time or the energy.

Keiko:  Let me show you my page.  Check out this background.   Don’t you think it’s great?

Al:  Yeah, it’s great.  Can I get back to my book now?

Keiko:  You haven’t even looked at my page.  Look at this.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 32: Negotiating a Business Deal.

This episode is called “Negotiating a Business Deal” (a b usiness agreement).  It’s a dialogue between Gia and Logan.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gia:  Why are the negotiations on this deal taking so long?  I thought we would be putting the finishing touches on it by now.

Logan:  The other side is holding out for more concession s.  I don’t know what they’re thinking.  They made some pretty big demands at t he start and I think we’ve given in to most of them.  Now they’re countering  with even more demands.

Gia:  They probably know that they have us over a barrel .  After all of the time and money we’ve put into this deal, they know that we do n’t want to walk away.

Logan:  That’s true and that’s why we’re still at the table, but they may be pushing too hard.  In the end, I don’t think we’ll cave  on those additional concessions.

Gia:  So the entire thing is touch-and-go right now?

Logan:  That’s how I would characterize it.  If I were  you, I wouldn’t make any long-term plans.

Gia:  Duly noted.  I won’t run out and buy that new h ouse and those three new cars.

 [end of dialogue]

Gia begins by asking, “Why are the negotiations on this d eal taking so long?” “Negotiation” is the process of trying to reach an agree ment – trying to agree with another person or another business, when each side “compr omises,” that is, each side gives in a little.  For example I want to buy a  new car and the person selling it says, “It’s 20,000 dollars,” and I say, “Oh, th at’s too much.  How about 18,000 dollars?” and the person selling – the seller – says, “Oh, no.  I could only go as low as 19,000 dollars,” and you say, “I’ll give you 18,500 cash.  I have the money with me,” and he says, “Okay, I’ll take it.”  That’ s a negotiation. Negotiations are always about time, power, and knowledg e.  That is, if you have a long time to wait or you need something done right away, if you have knowledge about what the other person wants, and fina lly if you have some other sort of influence or power over that person, all those t hings will affect your negotiation.

Gia wants to know why the negotiations on this deal (thi s agreement) are taking so long – are lasting such a long time.  She says, “I thou ght we would be putting the finishing touches on it by now.”  The expression “to put the finishing (or final) touches on (something)” means to be making small changes i n order to finish something so that it’s perfect.  The idea is that most o f the important work has already been completed.

Logan says, “The other side (the people they are negotia ting with) is holding out for more concessions.”  “To hold out” is a two-word phra sal verb meaning to delay agreeing to something because you are waiting to receive something more; usually we say you “hold out for” something.  For example,  someone wants to offer you a job and they offer you 50,000 dollars a yea r, and you say, “Uh, I’m not too sure.  Let me think about it,” and you wait, and yo u wait.  You are holding out for more money.  The boss may call you back and say, “Well, I’m sorry.  I need to make a decision, it’s been a week,” and you say, “Just one more day,” and he says, “Okay.  Just one more day.”  As time goes on the boss be comes more and more desperate.  He need to hire someone, and so you m ay get what you want because you have made him wait; you have used time to your advantage in the negotiation.  The same is true when you go to buy, for example, a new car at a place that sells a lot of cars.  The more time you can take with the salesperson, the more likely they will be to negotiate with you.  B ecause they’ve spent all that time with you they don’t want to have you walk away, and they having wasted an hour for example on trying to sell you a car.  Well, the  other side is holding out for concessions.  “Concessions” are things that you agree to do in order to reach an agreement.  It’s like a compromise; you say, “Well, okay.  I can’t give you more

 than 50,000 dollars (as the boss), but I can give you an extra week of vacation time.”  That would be a concession.

Logan says, “I don’t know what they’re thinking (the othe r side).  They made some pretty big demands at the start and I think we’ve gi ven in to most of them.” “Some pretty big demands” means some very large demands, where “demand” is something that you say you must have – I cannot do this dea l without it.  Logan says their company has already given in to most of their dem ands.  By the way, the word “demand” has a couple of different meanings;  the other meanings you can find in our Learning Guide.  “To give in” is a two -word phrasal verb meaning to agree to do what someone else wants you to do even t hough you don’t really want to do it.  So the parent who has a child who says, “Mommy, Mommy, I want to go to the store!  I want to go to the store!  I wa nt to!  I want to!  I want to!  I want to!”  Mommy can either say, “No, go to your room.   I’m not letting you go to the store,” or she can give in; she can say, “Okay.  You can  go to the store.” Nowadays, most parents just give in, or so it seems – so it  appears to me.  You know, when I was young…oh, never mind!

Logan says the other side is countering with even more dem ands.  “To counter” is when someone makes you a proposal: “I will sell you this car for 20,000 dollars,” and you say, “No.  I…I only want to pay 18,000 dollars.”  Your proposal is a counter proposal: he says 20,000; you say something diff erent.  That something different that the other person says is their counter proposal.  The verb is “to counter,” to offer something else instead of the original proposal.

Gia says, “They probably know that they have us over a barr el.”  The expression “to have (someone) over a barrel” (barrel) means to be in a situation where someone is very uncomfortable, or to be in a situation where you can beat the other person or take advantage of them knowing that you  will win.  For example, you live in an apartment and the person who owns the a partment raises your rent, but if you don’t have anywhere else to go or if you need to stay in that apartment he has you over a barrel; he has you in a situa tion where he can get what he wants because you don’t have the power to move.   In this case, the other side has knowledge about the situation of Gia and  Logan’s company, and they have power – they have them over a barrel.

Gia says, “After all of the time and money we’ve put int o this deal, they know that we don’t want to walk away.”  This is the idea I was tal king about earlier.  Gia and Logan’s company has spent a lot of time and money negotia ting this agreement, so they don’t want to waste that time and money – they d on’t want to walk away.

 “To walk away” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop  the negotiations, to end the discussion.

Logan says, “That’s true and that’s why we’re still at the  table.”  “To be at the table” means to be continuing to participate in the ne gotiations – to continue to talk to them.  Logan says, “they may be pushing too hard ( meaning they may be trying to do too much – trying to get too much).  In the end, I don’t think we’ll cave on those additional concessions.”  “To cave” (cave) as a verb  means to agree to do what the other person wants you to do just so you can reach an agreement; “to give in” or “to give up” are also ways of saying same  thing.  Gia says, “So the entire thing (the entire negotiation) is touch-and-go  right now?”  “Touch-and-go” is something that could fall apart at any time; it’s some thing, we would say, that is very fragile.  “To be fragile” means you could break it e asily.  Well, the negotiations are fragile – they’re touch-and-go.

Logan says, “That’s how I would characterize it (meaning t hat’s how I would describe it).  If I were you, I wouldn’t make any long-t erm plans (plans into the future).”  Gia says, “Duly noted.”  That phrase, “duly (d uly) noted,” is used to show that you have heard and understood what the other person has said and will think about it.  We use this phrase especially if we  need to make a decision about something.  Gia says, “Duly noted.  I won’t run ou t and buy that new house and those three new cars.”  “I won’t run out” means I w on’t go immediately and buy a new house and three new cars.  She’s joking, of cou rse.  She’s saying that she will not spend a lot of money because they still don’t  know how the negotiations are going to end up; that is, how they ar e going to come to a final result, what that result will be.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gia:  Why are the negotiations on this deal taking so long?  I thought we would be putting the finishing touches on it by now.

Logan:  The other side is holding out for more concession s.  I don’t know what they’re thinking.  They made some pretty big demands at t he start and I think we’ve given in to most of them.  Now they’re countering  with even more demands.

Gia:  They probably know that they have us over a barrel .  After all of the time and money we’ve put into this deal, they know that we do n’t want to walk away.

 Logan:  That’s true and that’s why we’re still at the table, but they may be pushing too hard.  In the end, I don’t think we’ll cave  on those additional concessions.

Gia:  So the entire thing is touch-and-go right now?

Logan:  That’s how I would characterize it.  If I were  you, I wouldn’t make any long-term plans.

Gia:  Duly noted.  I won’t run out and buy that new h ouse and those three new cars.

This episode is called “Moving Out of a Home.”  It’s a di alogue between Andre and Ellie.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

[A knock on door.]

Andre:  Hello.  Is anyone here?

Ellie:  Yes, can I help you?

Andre:  I saw your door open and I just wanted to make  sure everything was okay.  Did you just move in?

Ellie:  No, I’m moving out.  As you can see, I’m doing l ast-minute packing.  I think I’ve used up 10 rolls of packing tape!

Andre:  This looks like a major undertaking.  Are you movi ng yourself?

Ellie:  No, the movers are coming with the moving van to morrow morning.  I’m moving a few things into storage, and I’ll take a few o f the perishables and essentials in my car, but they’ll be doing the heavy lifti ng.  No loading for me. Before they come, though, I need to disassemble this de sk and this bookcase. It’ll be a long afternoon.

Andre:  I can see that.  Are you moving far?

 Ellie:  No, I’m only moving about a mile from here to  another apartment.

Andre:  Oh, so you’re not moving out of the area.

Ellie:  No, I’m not.

Andre:  I’m glad to hear that.  Let’s make a deal: I ’ll help you disassemble your furniture if you’ll promise to invite me over to your n ew place sometime.

Ellie:  Really?  Are you sure you’re willing to do that ?

Andre:  Sure.  Hand me those tools and I’ll have it d one in no time.

Ellie:  Boy, am I glad I left my door open.

Andre:  Yeah, so am I.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Andre knocking on a door.  He says, “Hello.  Is anyone here?”  Ellie says, “Yes, can I help you?”  Andre says, “I sa w your door open and I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.”  Andre a pparently lives near this house, saw the door open, and for some weird reas on decided to go and find out who was there.  He says, “Did you just move in?”  “To move in” is a two-word phrasal verb that means to begin living in a new place, when you move all of your things to a new apartment or a new house.  Ellie says, “ No, I’m moving out.”  “To move out” is the opposite of “to move in,” it’s when you are leaving a place: your apartment or your house.

Okay, so Andre doesn’t know this woman, and he doesn’t kn ow that she’s been living there, so maybe Andre isn’t from the neighborh ood.  Maybe Andre is a thief – a crook, a criminal.  Let’s find out!

Ellie continues, “As you can see, I’m doing last-minute packing.”  To do anything “at the last minute” means to do it right before the  deadline, right before it has to be done, to wait until there is no more time left.  “To pack” (pack) means to put your things in boxes, in suitcases so you can move them.  So,  “last-minute packing” (“packing” here is a noun) means the process of put ting all your things in boxes to move them at the very last possible opportunity.   Ellie says, “I think I’ve used up 10 rolls of packing tape!”  “To use up” mea ns to complete, to finish,

 to have no more of.  In this case, she’s used up 10 roll s of packing tape. “Packing tape” is wide, thin plastic tape – tape is sticky on  one side – and you use it to close a box to make sure it stays closed.  The ta pe typically comes on a “roll,” that’s a circle that you can then pull the tape  off of.

Andre says, “This looks like a major undertaking.”  Anythin g that is “major” is large or important, big.  An “undertaking” is a task, a  job to do, often a long and difficult one.  So you will often see these words toget her, “a major undertaking,” meaning a big job to do.  “Are you moving yourself?” An dre says, meaning are you doing this alone, is no one helping you.  Of course, we think Andre is interested in stealing her stuff and so, of course, he wants to know if anyone else is coming over.

Ellie, unhappily, says, “No, the movers are coming with the moving van tomorrow morning.”  The “movers” are the people whose job it is to come and help you pack.  You can actually hire people, pay them to come to yo ur house and help you put all your things into boxes if you have a lot of th ings, or perhaps if you’re old and don’t have the strength – or if you’re just lazy!   Ellie is having the movers come over tomorrow with the moving van.  By the way, I sho uld mention “mover” has a couple of different meanings in English, and those  are in the Learning Guide.  A “van” is a large truck that is used usually to m ove things from one place to another.  A “moving van” is usually a large what we w ould call “semi” or “semi truck.”  She says, “I’m moving a few things into storage, a nd I’ll take a few of the perishables and essentials in my car, but they’ll be doin g the heavy lifting.” “Storage” is a place where you can keep your boxes and oth er things, perhaps because you don’t have room in your house, perhaps because you are moving to a smaller house, or because you just hate to throw anythi ng away – to get rid of anything – and you have too much stuff.  We all have too  much stuff I think!

Ellie says, “I’ll take a few of the perishables and essenti als in my car.” Something that is “perishable” (perishable) is something , usually food, that you need to keep in a freezer or refrigerator.  If you d on’t, the food will, we would say, go bad; you won’t be able to eat it anymore.  So meat , for example: you can’t keep the meat outside of a refrigerator for two days, t he meat will go bad.  In fact, the recommended amount of time I think is two hours maxi mum.  So, she’s taking these perishable with her.  She’s also taking oth er “essentials,” things that she absolutely must have, things that she can’t wait to use : her toothbrush, or perhaps her favorite pillow.  The movers, however, will be doing the heavy lifting. “To lift” (lift) means to take something very heavy and move it off of the ground or off of a table.  You are picking it up; you are lifti ng it.  So, “heavy lifting” as a noun is when you have a lot of very heavy things – things that w eigh a lot that need to

 be moved.  Sometimes we use this expression just to mean a difficult task, something that is difficult or hard to do.  She says, “ No loading for me.”  “To load” (load) means to put the boxes into the moving van; “to load” is usually use when you are moving or going from one place to another and you are taking things with you.  If you are going to the airport, you will need t o load your luggage – load your suitcases into your car.  She needs to load the boxes i nto the moving van but she’s not going to do it herself, that’s why she says, “ No loading for me.” “Before they come,” she says, “I need to disassemble this de sk and this bookcase.”  “To disassemble” is the opposite of “assemble.”  “To assemble” is to put something together; “to disassemble” is to take someth ing apart.

Ellie says, “It’ll be a long afternoon,” meaning I have  a lot of work to do Andre, what do you want.  Andre says, “I can see that.  Are you moving far?”  Ellie says, “It’s none of your business buddy!”  No, she doesn’t say th at, does she?  No, she says, “No, I’m only moving about a mile from here to ano ther apartment.”  Andre says, “Oh, so you’re not moving out of the area,” meaning  away from this city. She says, “No, I’m not.”  Andre says, “I’m glad to hear t hat.  Let’s make a deal.” “To make a deal” means to reach an agreement with some one, when both people get something out of your agreement.  Well her e’s the agreement: Andre says, “I’ll help you disassemble your furniture (your desk and  bookcase) if you’ll promise to invite me over to your new place sometime.”  Now we see that Andre is not a criminal; he’s someone who is trying to start a romantic relationship with Ellie, you see.  He says, “I’ll disassemble your furniture i f you invite me over,” meaning if you ask me to come to your house for dinner, and Ellie says, “Really? Are you sure you’re willing to do that?”  So Ellie obvi ously likes Andre.  She probably shouldn’t since she has a boyfriend.  Oh, you d idn’t know that?  Yeah, she does!

Andre says, “Sure.  Hand me those tools (meaning give me those tools) and I’ll have it done in no time.”  “Tools” are things that you use to help you do something else.  You could have a hammer, you could have  a screwdriver; those are tools that you would use, perhaps to disassemble somet hing.  Andre says, “I’ll have it done in no time,” meaning very quickly, very soon.  Ellie says, “Boy, am I glad I left my door open so that any strange man  could come in and start talking to me.”  She really just said, “Boy, am I glad I left my door open,” but she meant what I said!  Andre says, not surprisingly, “Yeah, so am I.”  Nice job Andre – if that’s your real name!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 [A knock on door.]

Andre:  Hello.  Is anyone here?

Ellie:  Yes, can I help you?

Andre:  I saw your door open and I just wanted to make  sure everything was okay.  Did you just move in?

Ellie:  No, I’m moving out.  As you can see, I’m doing l ast-minute packing.  I think I’ve used up 10 rolls of packing tape!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 6 34: Resembling One’s Parents.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 634.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about how people look like th eir parents – seems pretty obvious.  But, we’ll be using some phrases and expre ssions related to your family and looking like members of your family.  Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Khaled:  Hi, what are you looking at?

Susanna:  Your photo albums.  Your roommate let me in  and said I could make myself comfortable while I waited for you.

Khaled:  There are some really incriminating pictures in  there.  You’d better give those back to me.

Susanna:  Not yet!  I’m looking at your baby pictures and  your family portraits. You’re the spitting image of your mother.

Khaled:  That’s not my mother.  That was our neighbor.

Susanna:  Oh, now that I look a little closer, I can see that you resemble your father.  You’re a chip off the old block.

Khaled:  That’s not my father.  That’s my father’s frie nd.  Now, why don’t I take those…

Susanna:  Wait!  These candids of your birthday parties a re so cute!  You were so adorable!

Khaled:  Right.  When I was a kid, I had a face only a  mother could love.

 Susanna:  That’s not true!  You have a great profile.  I’d expect to see your likeness in paintings and on statues.

Khaled:  Okay, enough with the brown-nosing.  What do you really want?

Susanna:  I don’t want anything…okay, just one little th ing.  My cousin is in town. I want to go out with Rick tonight and I thought we co uld double date.  Me, Rick, my cousin…and you.  What do you say?

Khaled:  I knew it had to be something.  Does she look l ike you?

Susanna:  We are like two peas in a pod.

Khaled:  Then, forget it!

Susanna:  Hmph!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue opens with Khaled saying, “Hi, what are you looking at?”  Susanna says, “Your photo albums.”  A “photo (or photography) a lbum” (album) is a book you use to keep your photographs in; usually they have plas tic that you put over the photographs to protect them.  Susanna says, “Your ro ommate let me in and said I could make myself comfortable while I waited for you.”  “Your roommate” would be the person that Khaled lives with.  He let S usanna in, meaning he opened the door and said, “Sure, come in,” and probab ly left.  The roommate said that Susanna could make herself comfortable, meanin g could sit down, could relax while she waited for Khaled.

Khaled says, “There are some really incriminating pictures  in there.” “Incriminating,” literally, is when you are made to loo k guilty of something.  If you come out of a room and there is blood on your hands and  you have a gun in your pocket and someone has been killed in the next room, the gun and the blood are incriminating; they show that you did something wrong.  In this case, however, Khaled means that the pictures are embarrassing, that t hey are ones that he does not want other people to see.  He says, “You’d be tter give those back to me,” meaning I want them back now.

Susanna says, “Not yet!  I’m looking at your baby pictures a nd your family portraits.”  “Baby pictures” are, of course, photograp hs of a very young child,

 usually less than one year old.  Many of us have baby picture s; I have a baby picture, that was the first picture my parents took of me  back in 1963.  They took another photograph again in 1973, and there aren’t very many photographs in between those 10 years.  But I have one picture: my baby picture.  Do I look cute?  I won’t tell you!  “Family portraits” are when yo ur whole family gets together and they take a picture of your whole family t ogether.  This we did a couple of times when I was growing up.  Unfortunately, there weren’t cameras big enough to take a picture of I and my 10 brothers a nd sisters!

Anyway, Susanna says to Khaled, “You’re the spitting image  of your mother.” When someone says you’re the “spitting (spitting) image of  (someone)” that means that you look almost exactly like that person.  The ot her day I was at the coffee shop, someone came up to me and said, “You are th ese spitting image of Brad Pitt,” and I said, “No, George Clooney, not Brad  Pitt!”  Actually, I’m the spitting image of Chewbacca from Star Wars !  By the way, the verb “to spit” usually means that you take some liquid from your mouth and you use your mouth to put it onto something else.  That’s to spit.  Why we say “spitting image” I’m not exactly sure.

Khaled responds to Susanna, “That’s not my mother,” mea ning the picture that she’s looking at is not a picture Khaled’s mother.  He says,  “That was our neighbor,” who could have been your mother – you don’ t know, really!  Susanna says, “Oh, now that I look a little closer, I can see that you resemble your father.” “To resemble (someone)” means to look like someone: “My n eighbor resembles his dog.”  Susanna says, “You’re a chip off the old blo ck.”  This is an old expression; “a chip off the old block” means that you are very similar to your parents, either by the way you look or by what you do – b y your actions.  If your father was a good football player, and you’re a good football player, someone might say, “You’re a chip off the old block.”

Khaled says, “That’s not my father.  That’s my father’s fr iend.  Now, why don’t I take those…”  Susanna says, “Wait!  These candids of your bi rthday parties are so cute!”  A “candid” picture or photograph is something that is taken without you, typically, realizing it.  Someone is taking a picture of yo u reading or a picture of you talking and you don’t know that they are taking a pict ure of you, that would be a candid picture.  “Candid” has a number of differe nt meanings, some of which are found in the Learning Guide.  Susanna thinks these pictures of Khaled’s birthday parties when he was younger are “cute, ” meaning they’re nice to look at, attractive, pretty.  We often use this word – this adjective to describe young children or small animals – or the children of sma ll animals, or the animals of small children!  All of these could be described as cut e – except my neighbors’

 dog, of course!  Susanna then says, “You were so adorable! ”  “Adorable” is like “cute,” it means very pretty, very attractive to you.

Khaled says, “Right,” meaning wrong.  He uses the word s arcastically: “Oh, yeah. Right!”  It depends on the way it is said.  Here, Khal ed is saying that’s not true. He says, “I had a face only a mother could love.”  This is an old expression; “to have a face only a mother could love” means that you are really ugly, that you are the opposite of cute and adorable, and that the o nly person who would love you because of the way that you look would be your own mot her, because a mother, we usually think, loves all of her children – reg ardless of how ugly they are!

Susanna says, “That’s not true!  You have a great profile .”  Your “profile” is the way your face looks from the side – with someone looking a t it from the side. “Profile” has several meanings in English, some of which are in our Learning Guide for this episode.  Susanna continues, “I’d expect to  see your likeness in paintings and on statues.”  He’s so beautiful, Susanna is saying of Khaled, that he could be in a painting or on a statue.  She says she w ould expect to see his likeness on a statute.  “Likeness” is a similarity in the way that something appears; it’s what something looks like.  A “statue” is a l arge piece of sculpture made of stone or metal, usually of a famous person or a nimal.  In Minnesota, they makes sculptures out of butter for the Minnesota Sta te Fair.  Bet you didn’t know that; well it’s true!

Khaled says, “Okay, enough with the brown-nosing.”  “To brown-nose (someone)” is to be very nice to someone because you want that person to help you.  We use that term sometimes in school.  “He’s a brow n-noser with the teacher.”  He says nice things to the teacher; he gives the  teacher things so that the teacher will give him a good grade.

Khaled then says, “What do you really want?”  Susanna says,  “I don’t want anything…okay, just one little thing.”  So course, Khaled was right.  She says, “My cousin is in town (meaning my cousin is visiting – is in the city where I live, she’s from somewhere else).  I want to go out with Rick t onight (presumably her boyfriend) and I thought we could double date,” meani ng you have a man and a woman who are dating – romantically involved – and then  another couple who are romantically involved, and the four of you go to di nner or to a movie or whatever.  That’s “double dating.”  She says, “Me, Rick, my cousin…and you.” Notice she says “me” instead of “I,” informally that’s very co mmon.  She says, “Me, Rick, my cousin…and you.  What do you say?” meaning wh at is your opinion, what do you think.  Are you interested, is what  she’s asking.

 Khaled said, “I knew it had to be something.  Does she l ook like you?” meaning does your cousin have a similar physical appearance as you do.   Susanna says, “We are like two peas in a pod.”  “Peas” are small gre en vegetables that come in – or grow rather in something called a “pod” – a “pe apod.”  Kind of like a podcast! Actually nothing like a podcast.  So, “two peas in the p od” means two things that are very similar.  She’s saying that she and her cousin rese mble each other; they look alike.

Khaled, when he learns that the cousin looks just like Su sanna says, “Then, forget it!”  Khaled is insulting Susanna, saying that she  isn’t pretty enough for him to go out with someone who looks like her.  That’s not n ice Khaled!  You shouldn’t say that sort of thing to a woman.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Khaled:  Hi, what are you looking at?

Susanna:  Your photo albums.  Your roommate let me in  and said I could make myself comfortable while I waited for you.

Khaled:  There are some really incriminating pictures in  there.  You’d better give those back to me.

Susanna:  Not yet!  I’m looking at your baby pictures and  your family portraits. You’re the spitting image of your mother.

Khaled:  That’s not my mother.  That was our neighbor.

Susanna:  Oh, now that I look a little closer, I can see that you resemble your father.  You’re a chip off the old block.

Khaled:  That’s not my father.  That’s my father’s frie nd.  Now, why don’t I take those…

Susanna:  Wait!  These candids of your birthday parties a re so cute!  You were so adorable!

Khaled:  Right.  When I was a kid, I had a face only a  mother could love.

# Arranging Airport Transfer

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 35: Arranging Airport Transfer.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 635.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Arranging Airport Transfer.”  Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

My wife and I bought a vacation package and we thought that it included everything.  We should have double-checked that it include d airport transfer to our hotel as well.  Hindsight is 20/20, they say.

My wife wanted to take a taxi, but I nixed that idea.  It would cost an arm and a leg.  I wanted a cheaper option so we went to ask abou t it at the airport information desk. …

Don:  Hello, my wife and I need to get to our hotel downtown.  What are our options?

Clerk:  Well, you could take a taxi.

Don:  We’re hoping to find a cheaper option.

Clerk:  Okay, in that case, a limo service would be out, too.  There are private shuttle services, but since you’re so far from downtown, yo u’ll be making a lot of stops and it will take a long time to get there.  You  could also take public transportation – the bus or the subway – but that’ll ta ke even longer.  Doesn’t your hotel have a courtesy shuttle?

Don:  I never thought of that.

 Clerk:  Many downtown hotels do.  Call your hotel and t hey’ll be able to tell you. They’ll probably have the best suggestion on how to get there, too, if they don’t have their own shuttle.  If you decide on a private shut tle service or to take public transportation, come back and I’ll give you more informat ion.

Don:  Thanks a lot.  I’ll give the hotel a call right n ow. …

Lucky for us, the hotel had a courtesy shuttle and it was o n its way.  Good thing, too, since I didn’t relish spending any more time at the  airport after a long red- eye!

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins: My wife and I bought a vacation package  and we thought that it included everything.  A “vacation package” is when a company sells you airplane tickets, your hotel, transportation, often your meals; all  of this is part of one price. He says, “We should have double-checked that it included air port transfer to our hotel as well.”  “To double-check” means to make sure tha t something is correct. To go back again to check something is to make sure it’s corr ect, or to inspect – to look at something.

They should have double-checked that their vacation package  included airport transfer.  The “airport” is where the planes fly in and  out of.  “Transfer” is taking someone from one place to another.  So, “airport tran sfer” is transporting, or taking you in a car or a bus from your airport to the ho tel.  Many hotels that are near the airport have free what are called “shuttles,”  which are small buses or vans that pick you up from the airport and take you back t o the hotel so you don’t have to pay for a taxi.  That’s true in a lot of big ci ties in the U.S.

“Hindsight is 20/20,” he says.  This is an old expression.  “ Hindsight” means looking back at what has happened in the past, considerin g what has already taken place.  “20/20” refers to the system that we use to determine how good your eyesight or your seeing ability is.  20/20 is what we  call perfect vision; you can see perfectly, you don’t need glasses.  I am definitely not 20/20, but hindsight is always 20/20, meaning it’s always easy to unde rstand something that has already happened.  The difficult part is seeing what  is going to happen in the future!

The story continues: My wife wanted to take a taxi (a taxica b), but I nixed the idea.  A “taxi,” or a “cab,” or a “taxicab” – they’re al l the same – is when you have a driver that you pay, usually based on how long you are in the car or how far the

 car travels, or both.  The taxi idea, however, was nixed by this man, Don we later learn his name is.  “To nix (nix) (something)” means to s ay no to it, to refuse to do it, to make sure it does not happen.  He says, “It wou ld cost an arm and a leg.”  Taking a taxi, that is, would cost an arm and a l eg.  This expression means very expensive, something that costs a lot of money, too much money.  He says, “I wanted a cheaper option (a cheaper choice) so I went to ask about it at the airport information desk.”  Many airports have informat ion desks.  I’m not sure if they would give you information about this, but maybe.

Don says, “Hello, my wife and I need to get to our hote l downtown.”  He’s talking to the woman who works at the information desk in the a irport.  “What are our options?”  The clerk says, “Well, you could take a taxi.”  Don says, “We’re hoping to find a cheaper (less expensive) option.”  The clerk says, “Okay, in that case (meaning if that’s what you are looking for), a limo se rvice would be out, too.” “Limo” is short for “limousine.”  It’s a very large, usua lly black car that is very long.  You often see limousines at expensive parties.  Whe n there are award shows here Los Angeles – and there are lots of them – th ere are always limousines that take the stars – the celebrities – to the  event.  There are also limos or limousines that are not long, that are more l ike a regular car, but very nice and comfortable.  A “limo service” is a company that w ill send a car to you – a nice car, not a taxi – and you pay typically one price; th ey charge you a certain amount and you know what that is in advance.  With a taxi  you may not know, because it depends on how long or how far it is that yo u ride in the taxicab.

Anyway the clerks says, “a limo service would be out.”  “To be  out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning not to be a possibility, to be impo ssible, to be eliminated as a choice.  She says, “There are private shuttle services, bu t since you’re so far from downtown, you’ll be making a lot of stops and it will take a long time to get there.”  A “shuttle service” is a company that arranges to  drive groups of people from one place to another, normally in a large car – a  large van.  What happens here in Los Angeles, and in some other cities, is you can ca ll up one of the shuttle services and they will come by and pick you up at your  house just like a taxicab would.  But they’ll also, on their way to the ai rport, stop and pick up other people, and so there, all of you go together.  It take s a longer time, then, to go from your house or your hotel to the airport because the shuttle may be stopping at three or four more places to pick up more people.  H owever, a shuttle is cheaper than a taxi, for sure, but you’ll be making a l ot of stops if you take it.  A “stop” is one of the places where the vehicle – the van st ops to pick up someone or to leave someone at their hotel or house.

 I should mention also that the word “shuttle” and the  expression “be out” have additional meanings, which can be found only in our Lea rning Guide.  Well, you can find them other places, too, but most especially in o ur Learning Guide!

The clerk says, “You could also take public transportation. ”  “Public transportation” is something that the government provide s.  Usually buses, subways, some trains are part of what we call public tran sportation.  She mentions two of these: the bus and the subway.  The “su bway,” of course, is a type of train that goes typically underground, although  sometimes it may be an elevated train, what is called in cities that have elevat ed trains an “el,” short for elevated, meaning up above the ground.  Subways, however , such as the one in New York, at least in the main part – the downtown Ma nhattan – are underground.  Even Los Angeles now has a subway.  Unfort unately, it doesn’t go very far from downtown and isn’t really very useful to you – but we have one! The clerk says, “Doesn’t your hotel have a courtesy shuttle?”   We talked earlier about how the hotels have their own shuttles – their ow n cars or vans that go and pick people up from the airport and bring them back to the hotel.  That’s called a courtesy shuttle.  “Courtesy” means, in this case, free; it doesn’t cost you any money.

Don, who’s not exactly an intelligent man, says, “I never thought of that.”  Hmm, Don, wake up!  The clerk says, “Many downtown hotels do (me aning many of them do have courtesy shuttles).  Call your hotel and they’ ll be able to tell you. They’ll probably have the best suggestion on how to get there, too, if they don’t have their own shuttle.  If you decide on a private shut tle service or to take public transportation, come back and I’ll give you more informat ion.”  So the clerk is telling Don, the idiot, to call his hotel, see if they have a free shuttle, if they don’t ask them what’s the best way to get from the airport to downtown where the hotel is located.  In Los Angeles, the downtown and the airp ort – the main airport are several miles apart.  Driving it takes, with no other cars on the road, probably about 25 to 30 minutes to get downtown.  So, this is a  big problem if you don’t have cheap transportation.

Don says, “Thanks a lot.  I’ll give the hotel a call righ t now.”  “To give (someone) a call” means to call them on the telephone.  Don says, “ Lucky for us, the hotel had a courtesy shuttle and it was on its way.”  Something that is “on its way” is something that is moving toward you, something that is com ing to you but is not yet there – not yet arrived.  He says, “Good thing, too (which means it was a good thing, it was a lucky or fortunate thing), since I  didn’t relish spending any more time at the airport after a long red-eye!”  “To  relish” (relish) means to enjoy, to look forward to.  Don says he did not relish – he di d not look forward to spending more time at the airport after a long red-e ye.  A “red-eye” (eye), like the

 eye you use to see, is an airplane flight that travels dur ing the night.  So for example, there’s a plane that leaves Los Angeles at midn ight that flies to New York City.  It takes six hours to get there roughly, and b ecause New York is three hours ahead of Los Angeles – the time difference is thr ee hours – if you leave at midnight from Los Angeles you’ll arrive in New York City at nine o’clock in the morning.  The plane flies all night, normally when you  would be sleeping.  What happens if you don’t get enough sleep?  Sometimes you w ill wake up and your eyes will be red, that’s why we call that kind of plane a  red-eye.  Strange but true!

Now let’s listen to the story and dialogue, this time a t a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

My wife and I bought a vacation package and we thought that it included everything.  We should have double-checked that it include d airport transfer to our hotel as well.  Hindsight is 20/20, they say.

My wife wanted to take a taxi, but I nixed that idea.  It would cost an arm and a leg.  I wanted a cheaper option so we went to ask abou t it at the airport information desk. …

Don:  Hello, my wife and I need to get to our hotel downtown.  What are our options?

Clerk:  Well, you could take a taxi.

Don:  We’re hoping to find a cheaper option.

Clerk:  Okay, in that case, a limo service would be out, too.  There are private shuttle services, but since you’re so far from downtown, yo u’ll be making a lot of stops and it will take a long time to get there.  You  could also take public transportation – the bus or the subway – but that’ll ta ke even longer.  Doesn’t your hotel have a courtesy shuttle?

Don:  I never thought of that.

Clerk:  Many downtown hotels do.  Call your hotel and t hey’ll be able to tell you. They’ll probably have the best suggestion on how to get there, too, if they don’t have their own shuttle.  If you decide on a private shut tle service or to take public transportation, come back and I’ll give you more informat ion.

 Don:  Thanks a lot.  I’ll give the hotel a call right n ow. …

Lucky for us, the hotel had a courtesy shuttle and it was o n its way.  Good thing, too, since I didn’t relish spending any more time at the  airport after a long red- eye!

# Being Lazy and Energetic

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 6 36: Being Lazy and Energetic.

This is ESL Podcast episode 636.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff M cQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in bea utiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Carmen and Elias.  I t uses a lot of vocabulary related to the ideas of laziness and being ener getic.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carmen:  Wake up!  You’re supposed to be working.

Elias:  Shhh, I’m trying to sleep.  The boss is out of the office today, so I consider it a holiday.  Today, I can be a little out of it if I  want to be.

Carmen:  Out of it?  You’re sleeping on the job – li terally!

Elias:  So what?  Aren’t you feeling a little tired o n a Monday morning?

Carmen:  I admit I’m a little sluggish, but that’s no reason to fall down on the job. We both have work to get done and I’m doing it.

Elias:  What’s wrong with you?  Why are you so hyper?  I’ m as hard working as the next guy, but I’m not going to jump through hoops when the boss is away.

Carmen:  You, hard working?  Don’t make me laugh!  Yo u’d better get back to work or when the boss gets back, he’ll call you a slacker aga in.

Elias:  Okay, I’m learning by your example.  I’m now as energetic and productive as you are.

Carmen:  Yeah?  Doing what?

Elias:  Telling my co-worker she’s a pain in the neck!

 [end of dialogue]

Carmen begins by saying, “Wake up!  You’re supposed to b e working.”  “Wake up” means stop sleeping; awaken.  Elias says, “Shhh, I’m tr ying to sleep.” “Shhh” means, of course, stop making noise.  Elias says he’s trying to sleep. “The boss is out of the office today (meaning his boss is no t there), so I consider it a holiday.  Today, I can be a little out of it if I  want to be.”  “To be out of it” means that you are not aware of what is happening arou nd you; you’re thinking of something else.  You may be talking to your wife or y our husband or your child and the other person doesn’t seem to be paying attenti on; they’re thinking about something else.  You ask them a question and they said, “ Oh, I’m sorry.  I was out of it.  I wasn’t paying attention.”  There are som e other meanings for this expression, and those can be found in the Learning Guide .

Elias says he’s a little out of it.  Carmen says, “Out of i t?  You’re sleeping on the job – literally!”  The expression “to sleep on the job” means that you are sleeping instead of working; that’s the most obvious or literal me aning – the actual meaning of the words is the meaning of “literally.”  B ut also we use this expression to mean someone isn’t doing what they’re suppose d be doing at work; they’re not doing their job; they’re not paying a ttention.

Elias says, “So what?”  “So what?” is an informal phrase  meaning I don’t care, or it’s used to show that you think whatever the other person  is talking about is not very important.  Elias says, “So what?  Aren’t you feeling  a little tired on a Monday morning?”  Carmen says, “I admit I’m a little slu ggish.”  “To be sluggish” (sluggish) means to be moving very slowly, without a lot of  energy.  She says, “that’s no reason to fall down on the job.”  The expre ssion “to fall down on the job” means to do poorly, not to do what you are expected  to do.  Carmen says, “We both have work to get done and I’m doing it.”  S o, Elias is obviously the lazy one in this dialogue and Carmen is the energetic one.  She has lots of energy; she works hard even on a Monday morning.

Elias then says, “What’s wrong with you?  Why are you so hyp er?”  “To be hyper” (hyper) means that you are very excited, overly excited we m ight say, too excited.  You have lots of energy, lots of enthusiasm, but  it’s almost too much. We often say that about, for example, young children, b ut it could also be said about an adult.  Not about me, I am never overly energ etic – trust me!  Elias says, “I’m as hard working as the next guy, but I’m not go ing to jump through hoops when the boss is away.”  The expression “to be hard w orking” means that you work hard; you are very serious about your job, you make sure you do the best job that you can do.  Elias says he is as hard working as the next guy.  This

 expression, “to be as (something – in this case hard worki ng) as the next guy,” or “to be as lazy as the next guy,” is used to compare peopl e, showing that you are normal – you are like other people; you don’t have anyth ing less about that quality than other people do, you might even have more of it.  So, when Elias says he is as hard working as the next guy, he means that he works just as hard as everyone else.  “But,” he says, “I’m not going to jump through hoops when the boss is away.”  The expression “to jump through hoops” (ho ops) means to work very hard to make someone, usually your boss, happy.  The wo rd “hoop” refers to something that is basically a big circle with a hole in  it.  In basketball, for example, the hoop is what you put the ball into and th rough.  Sometimes we’d say that we’re going to go play hoops, or play some hoops;  that means we’re going to play some basketball.  And when I say “we,” I m ean other people because I don’t really play basketball.  Although, I was on my seventh grade basketball team in junior high school, so if the Los Ang eles Lakers, our professional basketball team here, ever needs some help, I’m there to help them!

Elias is saying that he’s not going to jump through hoop s.  This expression actually refers to a different kind of hoop.  You may ha ve heard of Hula Hoops, where you have a round circle of plastic that you put and  you move your hips very quickly, and the circle – the hoop goes around your bod y.  We also use those kind of hoops, for example, in animal shows, especia lly dog shows.  You would make the dog jump through the hoop.  Well, tha t’s what Elias says he’s not willing to do; he’s not willing to put on a show – he ’s not willing to perform for anyone if the boss isn’t there, because there’s no one to  perform for.

Carmen says, “You, hard working?  Don’t make me laugh! ”  When someone says “don’t make me laugh” they’re saying that they don’t bel ieve you.  It’s a rude, informal phrase that is used to indicate that the othe r person is being ridiculous, that they are saying something stupid that you don’t beli eve.  Carmen says, “You’d better get back to work (you better start working  again) or when the boss gets back, he’ll call you a slacker again.”  A “slacker” (slacke r) is a lazy person, someone who doesn’t do anything unless you tell them or ask them, someone who doesn’t really have a clear goal in his life, someone  who doesn’t work hard. It’s an insulting term to use about someone.

Elias says, “Okay, I’m learning by example,” meaning I’m ob serving you; I’m learning by your example and I am getting that inform ation and it is changing the way I think or what I do – I’m learning by your example.   What is he learning? Well, he says he’s now as energetic and productive as Carmen  is.  “To be energetic” means to not become tired, to have lots of e nergy.  “Productive” means you get a lot of things done in a very short amoun t of time – a short period

 of time; you use your time very effectively.  We all want t o be productive when we’re at work – or at least we should want to be produ ctive!

Carmen says, “Yeah?  Doing what?” meaning how are you  being productive. Elias says, “Telling my co-worker she’s a pain in the neck!”  His “co-worker” is someone that he works with, in other words Carmen, and he’s being productive by telling Carmen that she’s a pain in the neck.  “A pa in in the neck” is someone who is very annoying, very irritating, someone who bother s you.  It could also be a thing; you could say “This class I’m taking is a pain in t he neck.”  It’s difficult; it bothers me; I don’t like it.  So, Elias ends our dialog ue by insulting Carmen, saying that she is a pain in the neck.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carmen:  Wake up!  You’re supposed to be working.

Elias:  Shhh, I’m trying to sleep.  The boss is out of the office today, so I consider it a holiday.  Today, I can be a little out of it if I  want to be.

Carmen:  Out of it?  You’re sleeping on the job – li terally!

Elias:  So what?  Aren’t you feeling a little tired o n a Monday morning?

Carmen:  I admit I’m a little sluggish, but that’s no reason to fall down on the job. We both have work to get done and I’m doing it.

Elias:  What’s wrong with you?  Why are you so hyper?  I’ m as hard working as the next guy, but I’m not going to jump through hoops when the boss is away.

Carmen:  You, hard working?  Don’t make me laugh!  Yo u’d better get back to work or when the boss gets back, he’ll call you a slacker aga in.

Elias:  Okay, I’m learning by your example.  I’m now as energetic and productive as you are.

Carmen:  Yeah?  Doing what?

Elias:  Telling my co-worker she’s a pain in the neck!

# Planting Flowers and Trees

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 37: Planting Flowers and Trees.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 637.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Download a Learning Guide f or this episode that will help you improve your English – and make the sun shine br ighter in the morning! It’s true!

This episode is a dialogue between Zuly and Eric about f lowers and trees.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Zuly:  Hurry up!  Mom will be home any minute and we’r e not done planting.

Eric:  Whose idea was it anyway to plant a garden for M om for her birthday? We’ve been working under this hot sun all day and the s mell of the fertilizer is really getting to me.

Zuly:  It was our idea, remember?  We both wanted to give Mom something special this year.  Look, we’re almost done.  We’ve alrea dy picked the weeds, prepared the soil, and dug the holes for the new seeds and flowers.  I’m taking the flowers out of their pots now and I’ll have them i n the ground in a minute. After that, all we have left to do is to plant the ne w tree.  Keep digging!

Eric:  Are you sure the hole needs to be this deep?

Zuly:  Yes, the book says that the roots need to have room  to grow.  That’s the perfect place for it, too.  It’ll get a lot of direct sunlight.

Eric:  Great, but my arms are so tired, they’re about t o fall off.

Zuly:  Move over.  I’ll dig for a while.  Why don’t you  water the new flowers?

Eric:  Sure, right after I take a little break.  In t he meantime, I’ll supervise.  Come on.  Keep digging.  You’re almost there…

 Zuly:  I think you’d better keep your mouth shut, or I’ ll think of some new uses for that fertilizer!

[end of dialogue]

Zuly and Eric are brother and sister.  Zuly says to Eric, “ Hurry up (go faster)! Mom will be home any minute (meaning very soon) and we ’re not done planting.” “To plant,” as a verb, means to put seeds or plants into  the ground so that they can grow, either to produce a flower or some kind of fo od typically.  A “seed” is a very small part of a tree or plant that when you put i t in the ground grows another tree or plant.  It’s how – one way how trees and plant s reproduce, how you get more of them.  The verb, then, is “to plant” seeds, fl owers, or trees – to put them in the ground.

Eric says, “Whose idea was it anyway to plant a garden for Mom for her birthday?”  A “garden” is an area often near your hou se where you grow plants, either flowers or food.  Many people grow certain kinds of food in gardens.  When I was young we had a small garden where we had tomatoe s and carrots and, I think, green onions.  I was never a very good gardener.  A “gardener” is someone who works in a garden.  A “gardener,” more comm only pronounced “gardner ,” is also someone who you bring to your house to cut you r grass and trees and so forth.

So, Zuly and Eric are planting a garden – that’s what we would say, “to plant a garden” – for their mother.  He says, “We’ve been workin g under this hot sun all day and the smell of the fertilizer is really getting to  me.”  “Fertilizer” (fertilizer) is often made from the waste of animals – if you understan d what I mean.  When the animal goes to the bathroom, you take what comes out  of the animal, and you put it in your garden, because it will help the gr ound – the soil we would call it; the dirt – it will help it give nutrients – give f ood to the plants that will then help the plant grow.  At least that’s what I think happen s – I’m not a gardener!  “To get to (someone)” means to bother someone, especially after a long period of time. “My new colleague (my new co-worker) is really getting t o me.”  He’s bothering me.

Well, Eric says that the smell of the fertilizer is getti ng to him.  Fertilizer doesn’t smell very nice!  Zuly responds, “It was our idea (both of us), remember?  We both wanted to give Mom something special this year.  Lo ok, we’re almost done (we’re almost finished; we have almost completed the g arden).  We’ve already picked the weeds, prepared the soil, and dug the holes f or the new seeds and flowers.”  Couple of words there: “We picked the weeds.”   A “weed” (weed) is a plant that you don’t want, that you didn’t put in you r garden but is growing there

 anyway.  That’s a weed.  “Weed” informally – slang – also  can mean marijuana, the drug that some people smoke.  In fact, there is a television show – I think it’s still running – it’s still being shown, called Weeds , about a family that grows marijuana.  Strange but true!  Well here, Zuly and E ric are trying to get rid of the weeds, that’s why Zuly says they have “picked them,” meaning  they have taken them out of the ground.  They’ve also prepared the soi l.  “Soil,” as I mentioned earlier, is another name for dirt or earth; it’s what  you put the seeds into when you are planting them.  “To dig” (dig) means to make a hole in the earth to usually put something in there.  The past tense of “di g” is “dug” (dug).  “Dig” has other meanings, which you can find in our Learning Gui de.  “Seeds,” we’ve already mentioned also, are a small part of the plant  that has all of the necessary genetic information to reproduce, or to make a new pla nt or a new tree.  A “hole,” you probably know, is an area with nothing in it surroun ded by something else. You can have a hole in the wall; you have the wall, but  then you have a circle, let’s say, that has nothing in it – there’s no wall.  Th at’s a hole.

So Zuly says that we’ve already picked the weeds, prepared t he soil, and dug the holes for the new seeds and flowers.  “I’m taking the flowers out of their pots now and I’ll have them in the ground in a minute.”  A “p ot” (pot) is usually a round, small container, like a small bucket, that you put soil i nto – dirt into, and you can grow a plant in this little pot, and you can move the  pot from one part of the house to another.  In this case, Zuly is planting flowers that are in small pots. She will take them out of the pots and put them in the ground in the garden so they can grow bigger.  After putting the flowers in the ground, she says that all we have left to do is to plant the new tree.  The wor d “left” here is not the opposite of “right”; “left” here means remaining or st ill available.  For example, if you have five cookies and you eat two of the cookies, I can ask you, “How many cookies do you have left?”  How many are remaining?  And the answer, of course, is one, because I ate two of them when you were not looking.  You have to be careful with me!

So, Zuly is saying they’re almost finished, and tells Eric t o keep “digging,” keep taking dirt out of the ground, making holes, so they can plant the flowers.  Eric says, “Are you sure the hole needs to be this deep?”  “To  be deep” means to be below the surface, going far below something.  If you die and they bury your body, they will dig a deep grave.  A “grave” is a place where you put a dead body.  The grave has to be deep – it has to be a hole t hat goes down far into the earth.

Eric is asking Zuly if the hole has to be very deep – “this deep?”  Zuly says, “Yes, the book says that the roots need to have room to grow.”   The “roots” (roots) of a plant or tree are the parts of the plant or tree tha t are below the ground that you

 can’t see.  “To grow” is when a living thing becomes bigg er, older.  Zuly says they need these big holes – these deep holes so that the roots have room to grow, they have a place where they can grow.  Zuly says, “T hat’s the perfect place for it, too.  It’ll get lots of direct sunlight. ”  “Sunlight” is light from the sun, obviously.  “Direct sunlight” is when the sunlight goes rig ht on it, there’s nothing in between it, it’s not blocked by anything else.

Eric says, “Great, but my arms are so tired, they’re about to fall off.”  “To fall off” means they are about to come off of his body, to leave o r become disconnected from his body.  Of course, Eric is joking; it’s just a way of  expressing how tired he is.

Zuly says, “Move over.  I’ll dig for a while.  Why don’t you water the new flowers?”  “To water,” as a verb, means to put water u sually on a plant or a tree or grass to help it grow.  Eric says, “Sure, right after  I take a little break.”  I’m going to stop working right now, he says.  “In the meant ime (meaning while I am doing that), I’ll supervise.”  “To supervise” (supervise) me ans to manage, to watch how someone is doing something, to give them instru ctions.  It’s what a boss does.  In fact, a person who supervises is often called  a supervisor, ending in “or”.  Eric says, “Come on.  Keep digging.  You’re a lmost there.”  He’s saying this to Zuly.  Zuly says, “I think you’d better keep your mo uth shut (“to keep your mouth shut” means to stop talking) or I’ll think of some new uses for that fertilizer!”  She’s basically saying to Eric if you don’t be  quiet I may take this smelly, unpleasant fertilizer and, perhaps, throw it at  you.  That’s the way brother and sisters often act, of course.  I know that very well!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Zuly:  Hurry up!  Mom will be home any minute and we’r e not done planting.

Eric:  Whose idea was it anyway to plant a garden for M om for her birthday? We’ve been working under this hot sun all day and the s mell of the fertilizer is really getting to me.

Zuly:  It was our idea, remember?  We both wanted to give Mom something special this year.  Look, we’re almost done.  We’ve alrea dy picked the weeds, prepared the soil, and dug the holes for the new seeds and flowers.  I’m taking the flowers out of their pots now and I’ll have them i n the ground in a minute. After that, all we have left to do is to plant the ne w tree.  Keep digging!

 Eric:  Are you sure the hole needs to be this deep?

Zuly:  Yes, the book says that the roots need to have room  to grow.  That’s the perfect place for it, too.  It’ll get a lot of direct sunlight.

Eric:  Great, but my arms are so tired, they’re about t o fall off.

Zuly:  Move over.  I’ll dig for a while.  Why don’t you  water the new flowers?

Eric:  Sure, right after I take a little break.  In t he meantime, I’ll supervise.  Come on.  Keep digging.  You’re almost there…

Zuly:  I think you’d better keep your mouth shut, or I’ ll think of some new uses for that fertilizer!

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 638.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can go there and downloa d a Learning Guide for this episode.  The Learning Guide contains all of  the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, culture notes, comprehension questions, and – yes there’s more – and a complete transcr ipt of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is about fire and the people who try to pu t fires out – to extinguish fires, as we’ll learn.  Those are firefighters.  Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Rebecca:  Look, there’s smoke coming from six stories up.

Hugh:  Yes, I know.  Didn’t you hear the fire alarm go  off upstairs a few minutes ago?

Rebecca:  No, but I’m really glad there’s a fire station  only a few blocks away. Hey look, there’s the fire engine.  Here come the firef ighters!

Hugh:  Yeah, let’s get back to work.  I’m sure they’ll h ave the blaze under control pretty quickly.

Rebecca:  How can you work with all of this excitement?  Ma ybe I should get the fire extinguisher from the hallway and go upstairs to h elp.

Hugh:  I think that’s a really bad idea.  You can see f or yourself that the firefighters are getting ready to fight the fire.  Th ey’re getting the ladder out and attaching the fire hose to the hydrant.  Anyway, it’s pr obably just a false alarm.

Rebecca:  If the smoke detector went off then I’m sure th ere’s a fire.  We’ll know if we start to see something burning near a window or ashes coming down.

Hugh:  I’ve never seen you like this before.  Why are you so  excited?

 Rebecca:  I wanted to be a firefighter when I grew up .  I’ve always had a fascination with fire.

Hugh:  Ah, that explains it.  Would it make you feel be tter if I lit up a cigarette?

[end of dialogue]

Rebecca begins by saying to Hugh, “Look, there’s smoke comin g from six stories up.”  “Smoke” is the gray or black air that comes from som ething that is burning; it’s something that comes from a fire typically.  “Where t here’s smoke, there’s fire” is an old expression that means if you see some eviden ce of something it’s very likely that that something actually exists.  Typically, it refers to something bad that might be happening.  Well here, the smoke i s coming from the fire in a real way – literally.  The fire is in a building, and the building has six stories.  A “story” here means a floor or a level of a building.  “Story” has other meanings, of course, in English, and those can be found in this episode ’s Learning Guide.

Hugh says, “Yes, I know.  Didn’t you hear the fire alarm go off upstairs a few minutes ago?”  A “fire alarm” is a loud sound, sometime s with flashing lights, that is used to tell people – to let people know that ther e is a fire in the building and they should leave.  When I was growing up, and still I’m  sure, in schools there are “fire drills.”  These are practice exercises of what to  do, where to go if there is a fire.  And so, the school would turn on the fire a larm, and that would tell teachers and students that they needed to get up and le ave the building.  This fire alarm is in a building, and Hugh says it goes off.   He said, “Didn’t you hear the fire alarm go off?”  “To go off” is a two-word p hrasal verb, here meaning for an alarm to begin making noise.  A fire alarm is just o ne kind of alarm.  Many of us have an alarm that helps us wake up in the morning: a sound that comes from your clock or clock radio.  That’s also an alarm.  My alarm g oes off at 5:45 in the morning.  This is a fire alarm, and so the fire alarm went off.  Notice the past tense.  “To go off” can also be used with the prepositio n “on,” meaning to start yelling at or to get mad at: “I don’t want you going off on your brother.”  I don’t want you getting mad at your brother.  Or, “He went o ff on his wife for forgetting to buy his favorite food for dinner.”  He, of course, i s someone who will not be sleeping in his regular bed this evening!

Rebecca says, “No (she didn’t hear the fire alarm go off) , but I’m really glad there’s a fire station only a few blocks away.”  A “fire st ation” is a large building where firefighters stay, and where there are large mac hines – large trucks really, that are called “fire engines.”  And these fire engin es go and try to put out – to extinguish, to get rid of – fires.  Rebecca says, “Hey look, there’s the fire engine.”

 As I said, it’s also called a “fire truck,” usually it’s red  in color.  She says, “Here come the firefighters!”  “Firefighters” are people who se job it is to put out fires. We used to call them simply “firemen,” but some people wanted a term that did not have the word “man” in it – we won’t talk about t hat issue here – so now they’re called more commonly “firefighters.”

The firefighters are coming.  Hugh says, “Yeah, let’s ge t back to work (meaning let’s return to our jobs).  I’m sure they’ll have the blaze under control pretty quickly.”  A “blaze” (blaze) is a large fire, especially a big and dangerous one. Hugh says that the firefighters will have the blaze “unde r control,” meaning they will be able to manage it, they will be able to make sure that it doesn’t get any bigger.  They’ll have it under control pretty, or very, quickly.

Rebecca says, “How can you work with all of this excitement?  Maybe I should get the fire extinguisher from the hallway and go upsta irs to help.”  A “fire extinguisher” is a metal, typically round container that you hold in your hands, and you press a button and it sprays out a chemical that he lps put out a fire – a small fire, like in your kitchen for example.  “Extinguish er” comes from the verb “to extinguish,” which means to get rid of or put out a fire.  A fire extinguisher, of course, won’t really help in this situation; you need som ething larger.

Hugh says, “I think that’s a really bad idea.  You can see for yourself that the firefighters are getting ready to fight the fire.”  W e use that verb, “to fight,” when we are talking about putting out a fire.  “They’re ge tting the ladder out and attaching the fire hose to the hydrant.”  A “ladder” (ladder) allows you to climb up high, for example to the top of a building.  A ladde r has two long pieces of metal or wood that are vertical – they go up and down, and then they are connected by smaller horizontal pieces of wood or metal, and those ar e the ones you use to step on to go up to a higher level.  Fire engines have ladders that can allow the firefighters to go up high to help fight the fires.

They are getting the ladder out, meaning they are get ting it ready, and attaching, or connecting, the fire hose to be hydrant.  A “hydrant ” (hydrant) is something that you will find near the road – near a street.  It  is usually painted red, sometimes orange, maybe yellow.  It is connected to the w ater pipes underneath the street, and firefighters can open the hydrant and water will come out and they use that water to put out the fire.  They use a “fire  hose,” which is a long, flexible usually plastic tube that carries the water from the hyd rant to the place of the fire.

Hugh says, “Anyway, it’s probably just a false alarm.”  A “f alse alarm” is when people think there’s a fire, but there really isn’t.  I t can also be used to talk about

 a situation where people think there’s a big problem, but there really isn’t: “I thought my friend was having a heart attack, but he wasn’ t.  It was a false alarm.”

Rebecca says, “If the smoke detector went off then I’m sure  there’s a fire.”  The “smoke detector” is a small device that you find in buildi ngs and homes that makes a very loud noise when there is smoke in the air, let ting people know that there may be a fire.  Remember, where there’s smoke, th ere’s fire!  Well, this smoke detector “detects,” or figures out whether there i s smoke in the air, and makes a loud sound.  Rebecca says, “If the smoke detector we nt off (remember, we talked about “to go off” earlier) then I’m sure th ere’s a fire.  We’ll know if we start to see something burning near a window or ashes c oming down.”  “Burning” comes from the verb “to burn,” which is when something is damaged or destroyed by fire.  “Ashes” (ashes) are gray or black pieces of  powder that are left after something burns, especially wood or paper, yo u get lots of ashes.

Hugh says, “I’ve never seen you like this before.”  I guess Hugh was very excited, ‘cause his voice went up there!  “Why are you so e xcited?”  Rebecca says, “I wanted to be a firefighter when I grew up.”  Okay.  “I’ve always had a fascination with fire.”  “To have a fascination with (som ething)” means that you are very interested in something; you spend a lot of tim e thinking about something.

Hugh says, “Ah, that explains it.”  Traditionally, we t hink about boys thinking about becoming firemen when they grow up.  That’s kind  a classic, at least in the United States, dream that some young boys have, but Rebecca  said she wanted to be a firefighter when she was growing up.  Hugh says,  “Ah, that explains it (that tells me the reason why you are excited).”  Then he  tries to make a joke; he says, “Would it make you feel better if I lit up a cigare tte?”  “Lit up” comes from “to light up” (“light” is the present tense).  You can also say “lighted up,” both are correct: “lit” or “lighted.”  “To light up a cigarette ” means to burn a small fire at the end of a cigarette so that you can smoke it.  Now, the interesting thing here is that Hugh wants to go back to work even though there is a fire in the same building where he is working at, six floors up.  I guess H ugh really love his job!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rebecca:  Look, there’s smoke coming from six stories up.

Hugh:  Yes, I know.  Didn’t you hear the fire alarm go  off upstairs a few minutes ago?

 Rebecca:  No, but I’m really glad there’s a fire station  only a few blocks away. Hey look, there’s the fire engine.  Here come the firef ighters!

Hugh:  Yeah, let’s get back to work.  I’m sure they’ll h ave the blaze under control pretty quickly.

This episode is a dialogue at a restaurant between Paul o and the waiter – actually the waitress.  Here we call her the “server,” it’ s the same thing.  They’re going to be talking about soups and salads, so lots of vo cabulary related to soups and salads in this episode.  Let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

After a long tiring day at work, I stopped at a restaur ant nearby for a quick meal.

Server:  Hi, I’m Ursula.  Can I get you something to dr ink?

Paulo:  Yes, I’d like an iced tea and I’m also ready to  order.  I’ll just have a bowl of soup and a salad.

Server:  Sure, no problem.  What kind of soup would you  like?  We have chicken noodle, minestrone, and cream of mushroom.

Paulo:  Do you have something that’s hearty?

Server:  If you want something hearty, I would suggest our clam chowder or beef stew.

Paulo:  I’ll take a bowl of beef stew.

Server:  Great!  What kind of salad would you like: a che f salad, Caesar salad, or Cobb salad?

Paulo:  I’ll just have a garden salad.

 Server:  Okay, what kind of dressing would you like?

Paulo:  What kind do you have?

Server:  We have French, Italian, ranch, Thousand Island,  and vinaigrette.

Paulo:  Do you have blue cheese?

Server:  Oh yes, I forget to mention blue cheese.  Okay, that’s a bowl of beef stew and a garden salad with blue cheese dressing.  Will that be all?

Paulo:  Yes, that’s all. … By the time I had finished placing my order, I was even m ore tired.  Do you sometimes feel that life gives you too many choices?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Paulo telling us that he is g oing to a restaurant for a quick meal.  He says he’s had a long tiring day.  A “tirin g day” is a day that makes you tired, that makes your body feel weak or sleepy or tired.  He sits down and the server, whose name is Ursula, comes in and says, “H i, I’m Ursula.  Can I get you something to drink?”  Ursula is not a common wom an’s name anymore.  I once knew a Sister Ursula, but that’s a different story.

Paulo says, “Yes, I’d like an iced tea and I’m also ready t o order.  I’ll just have a bowl of soup and a salad.”  When he says “I’ll have” he means this is what I want to order.  When he says “I’ll just have” he means just thi s and nothing else.  He’s going to order a “soup,” which is a bowl of hot food, usually liquid or there’s liquid in it, that you eat with a spoon.  Or, he’s going to h ave a “salad,” which is when you have many different vegetables or possibly fruits, usual ly uncooked, that are torn into small pieces.  The most common vegetable in a salad is lettuce, which is typically green, although it can be red and perhaps bl ue – no, I don’t think it can be blue, just kidding!

Ursula says, “Sure, no problem.  What kind of soup would you like?”  That’s a very polite way of asking: “would you like?”  “What kind o f soup would you like?” What kind of soup do you want?  She says, “We have chicken n oodle, minestrone, and cream of mushroom.”  “Chicken noodle so up” has small pieces of cooked chicken and long, spaghetti-like noodles.  In t he United States, it’s considered a food that you eat when you are not feelin g well.  When you have a cold, for example, your mother will make you a bowl o f hot chicken soup –

 chicken noodle soup.  “Minestrone” (minestrone) is a soup we associate with Italy.  In Italian restaurants, at least in the U.S., t his soup has different kinds of vegetables and often a little bit of pasta.  It’s typical ly in a salty tomato, or perhaps spinach-based liquid.  “Cream of mushroom” is a  thick soup made from heavy cream or milk that has been blended together – put  together with cooked mushrooms and other spices.

Paulo says, “Do you have something that’s hearty?”  The ad jective “hearty” (hearty), when used, in this case with soup, means somethi ng that will make you feel full after you finish eating it.  It’s very large,  and we would probably say it is filling.  A meal that is “filling” (filling) is a mea l that makes you feel like you can’t eat any more when you are done eating it.

The server says, “If you want something hearty, I would sugg est our clam chowder or beef stew.”  “Clam chowder” is another thick s oup that is made with clams; “clams” are animals that live in the ocean, in wh at’s called a shell.  It’s also made with potatoes, heavy cream, sometimes bacon.  Tha t is what we call, actually, New England clam chowder.  In the Midwest, in Minnesota where I’m from, we called it Boston clam chowder.  Boston is in the region of the United States known as New England, which is in the northeast pa rt of the U.S., the oldest part of the United States when it comes to colo nists who came from Europe.  The other kind of clam chowder is red instead o f white.  New England clam chowder is white.  The other kind of clam chowder is red; it uses tomatoes instead of milk or cream, and that is called Manhattan clam chowder.  Manhattan is a part of New York City.  In fact, I think when I was growing up we sometimes called it New York clam chowder.  In any case, you have these  two kinds of clam chowder.  Clam chowder in the United States has traditi onally been served on Fridays.  Restaurants would have clam chowder on Fridays.  T hat was because there used to be a requirement for Catholics – people  of the Roman Catholic religion – not to eat meat on any Friday throughout t he year.  Those regulations changed in the 1960s.  However, the tradition of alwa ys having clam chowder on Friday continued with many restaurants, and still toda y when you go to a restaurant that has different kinds of soup they will oft en have a clam chowder on Friday.

The second kind of hearty soup Ursula recommends is beef stew .  “Stew” (stew) is a thick soup that is made by cooking meat, vegetables, an d potatoes in a liquid that is salty, usually, for several hours; it takes a long  time to make a good beef stew.  There are different kinds of stew; beef is the mo st common meat you will find in stews, though you can make them with other meat s of course.  In Minnesota, every fall there are beef stews that are mad e as part of large celebrations, what are called fall festivals, and the ste w is made in a very large

 pot.  This is called in Minnesota “booya” (booya).  If you go to Minnesota or the Midwest in the fall you will find booya, at least in Mi nnesota and Wisconsin. More recently, the word “booya” has taken on a different  meaning; it is often spelled with an “h” at the end, and it means sort of “ take that,” or “there you go.” It’s something you yell at someone in certain situations.  We’ll talk about that on a different episode.

Getting back to our food: Paulo says, “I’ll take a bowl o f beef stew.”  “I’ll take” means same as “I’ll have,” it means “I want to order.”  The server says, “Great! What kind of salad would you like: a chef salad, Caesar s alad, or Cobb salad?” These are three common salads found in American restauran ts.  Let’s start with the chef (chef) salad.  A “chef salad” typically has lettuce , it has an egg that is completely cooked; we would call in a hard boiled egg.  It has small pieces of ham, chicken, cheese, as well as some other vegetables.  That ’s a chef salad.  A “Caesar (Caesar) salad” is a salad that has a special kind o f lettuce called Romaine lettuce in a dressing – a Caesar dressing.  “Dre ssing” is the liquid that you often put on top of the salads.  A Caesar salad has ch eese; it has usually what are called “croutons,” which are small pieces of crunchy fried bread. Sometimes there’s chicken or shrimp on the top of a Caesa r salad, but not always.  The Caesar dressing itself is made from several dif ferent ingredients, including olive oil, garlic, and anchovies.  A “Cobb (Cob b) salad” is a type of salad that has different kinds of lettuce.  It also has a  hard boiled egg, small piece of ham and chicken, cheese, sometimes avocado, tomato, and on top there is what is called a “blue cheese dressing,” which is made, of course, from cheese.

Paulo doesn’t want a chef, Caesar, or Cobb salad.  He says, “I’ll just have a garden salad.”  A “garden salad” is a small, simple sal ad made with lettuce and a few other vegetables, but no meat and typically no cheese .

The server says, “What kind of dressing would you like?”  Pau lo says, “What kind do you have?”  The lovely Ursula says, “We have French, Ita lian, ranch, Thousand Island, and vinaigrette.”  All of these are ki nds of liquid dressing.  We’ll go through them quickly.  “French” is a reddish-orange d ressing made from oil, vinegar, usually some ketchup, other herbs and spices blende d together.  It’s a very smooth, thick dressing.  “Italian dressing” is almost clea r in color.  It’s also made from oil and vinegar, adding salt, pepper, someti mes some very small vegetables – small pieces of vegetables, as well as some her bs.  “Ranch dressing” is white and thick, typically made from buttermil k, sour cream, and mayonnaise.  “Thousand Island dressing” is a type of salad d ressing that is light orange, almost pink.  It’s made from mayonnaise, ketchup, minced pickles, and

 other vegetables.  “Vinaigrette” (vinaigrette) is a sim ple mixture – combination of oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper.

Once again, Paulo doesn’t like any of his choices; he says, “ Do you have blue cheese?”  We’ve already talked about that.  The server says, “Oh yes, I forget to mention blue cheese.  Okay, that’s a bowl of beef stew a nd a garden salad with blue cheese dressing.  Will that be all?”  Paulo says, “Ye s, that’s all,” meaning I don’t want any more food.

By the time he finished placing his order he says, “I was e ven more tired.  Do you sometimes feel that life gives you too many choices?”  Paulo  is tired because he had to select from long lists of food types, salads and sou ps.  But that’s not unusual in an American restaurant, where they give you of ten many choices when you are ordering your food.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

After a long tiring day at work, I stopped at a restaur ant nearby for a quick meal.

Server:  Hi, I’m Ursula.  Can I get you something to dr ink?

Paulo:  Yes, I’d like an iced tea and I’m also ready to  order.  I’ll just have a bowl of soup and a salad.

Server:  Sure, no problem.  What kind of soup would you  like?  We have chicken noodle, minestrone, and cream of mushroom.

Paulo:  Do you have something that’s hearty?

Server:  If you want something hearty, I would suggest our clam chowder or beef stew.

Paulo:  I’ll take a bowl of beef stew.

Server:  Great!  What kind of salad would you like: a che f salad, Caesar salad, or Cobb salad?

Paulo:  I’ll just have a garden salad.

Server:  Okay, what kind of dressing would you like?

 Paulo:  What kind do you have?

Server:  We have French, Italian, ranch, Thousand Island,  and vinaigrette.

Paulo:  Do you have blue cheese?

Server:  Oh yes, I forget to mention blue cheese.  Okay, that’s a bowl of beef stew and a garden salad with blue cheese dressing.  Will that be all?

Paulo:  Yes, that’s all. … By the time I had finished placing my order, I was even m ore tired.  Do you sometimes feel that life gives you too many choices?

# Being Genuine and False

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 40: Being Genuine and False.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 640.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  Why?  Well, because if you do, you can download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even faster.  Even faster than what, you ask?  Even  faster than just listening to the episode, you see!

On this episode we’re going to listen to a dialogue be tween Javier and Floriane. It’s going to be about people who are genuine – peop le who mean what they say, and people who are false – who say one thing but mean something else.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Javier:  I saw Terry cozying up to you this morning.  What was that about?

Floriane:  He was just offering me some advice on my fi rst proposal.

Javier:  Sure, he was.  What were his true intentions?

Floriane:  I think he was being upfront about wanting  to help a new employee.  I don’t think he had an ulterior motive.

Javier:  I wouldn’t take Terry at face value.  He has a re putation around the office of being two-faced.  He’ll try to get to know you under  false pretenses and then stab you in the back.

Floriane:  I don’t get that feeling from Terry.  He seemed genuine and open.  By the way, was there something you needed?

Javier:  Me?  No.  I was just trying to watch out for you.

Floriane:  In that case, I’d better get back to work, an d I’ll keep your warning in mind.  I’ll beware of anyone giving me advice who may ha ve an ulterior motive.

 [end of dialogue]

Javier says to Floriane, “I saw Terry cozying up to you this mo rning.  What was that about?”   “To cozy (cozy) up to (someone)” means to d o and to say things to try to have a close relationship with the other person,  usually because you want something from that person.  So, the woman sitting in  your office wants to get information from you about your clients – who you are w orking with.  So she comes up to your desk, and she’s very friendly: she brings you a doughnut, she laughs at all of your jokes – you get the idea – she’s cozyin g up to you.  It could be a man with a woman; it could be two women or two  men.  It’s not a romantic thing, although it could lead to something romantic I suppose.  The word “cozy” can also mean comfortable.  “To be cozy” means to be comfo rtable, for example sitting on a comfortable chair.

Well here, someone – Terry – is cozying up to Floriane.  Floriane says, “He was just offering me some advice on my first proposal.”  A “p roposal” is a written document that presents some solution to a problem.  Oft en, it is asking for money in order to carry out – in order to do that solution.  You may write a proposal, for example, to get money for a new product, and you give th at to your boss or your boss’s boss and someone says yes or no to your proposal.  If yo u are a charitable organization and you want to get money from  some rich person, like Bill Gates for example, you would write a proposal and send it to him.  I’m not sure if he’ll say yes!  That’s what a proposal is, at lea st in the business sense.  In the personal sense, a proposal is when typically a man asks a woman to marry him, but in the business sense it’s something different.

Javier says, “Sure, he was.”  Remember Floriane said that Terry was just giving her some advice on her proposal; he wasn’t trying to cozy up  to her she says. But Javier doesn’t believe her; he says, “Sure, he was.”  Notice he seems to be agreeing with Floriane, but in fact he means the opp osite; it depends on the way you say it.  If a husband comes home late from work and says that he was working late on a project, if his wife doesn’t believe him she might say, “Sure, you were.”  It’s the tone – it’s the intonation that dete rmines what the meaning is here, and here Javier is doubting what Floriane is saying .  He says, “What were his true intentions?”  “His true intentions” are the r eal reasons why he was doing something.

Floriane says, “I think he was being upfront about wanti ng to help a new employee.”  He was just trying to help her – he was bei ng upfront.  “Upfront” (upfront – one word) means direct, honest, without tryi ng to hide anything. Floriane says, “I don’t think he (Terry) had an ulterior  motive.”  An “ulterior motive” means a secret, hidden reason for doing somethin g, especially if it has

 negative consequences for someone else.  If someone says, “ Oh, I will help you for free,” they might have an ulterior motive; they mig ht have some other reason why they are helping you, not just because they are nice.

Well, Floriane does not think that Terry has an ulteri or motive.  Javier says, “I wouldn’t take Terry at face value.”  “To take (someone ) at face value” means to understand or to accept something as it appears, without  thinking there is a hidden meaning or hidden explanation.  If someone says,  “I’m busy, I’m sorry I can’t help you,” you will probably take their word at fa ce value, meaning okay, they’re busy; I believe that.  But, Javier says that you sho uld not take Terry at face value.  He says that Terry has a reputation around t he office for being two- faced.  A “reputation” is what other people think abou t you, it’s other people’s opinions about you.  “To be two-faced” means that you a re dishonest; you are not trustworthy.  You say things to one person, and then  you’ll talk to someone else about the same subject and you’ll say something differ ent.  You tell one person that you like your boss, you tell another person tha t you hate your boss; that’s being two-faced.  Javier says that Terry will try to get to know you under false pretenses and then stab you in the back.  Wow, this T erry’s a pretty evil person!  The expression “false pretenses” (pretenses) means dishonestly, not honestly, someone pretending to do or to be something that isn’t real – isn’t true.

Javier says that Terry will try to get to know Floriane und er false pretenses. Notice we use the word “under” with this phrase – so und er false pretenses.  And then, after he knows her, he will stab her in the back.  The expression “to stab (stab) (someone) in the back” means to suddenly do somethin g that will hurt the other person.  You’ve been very nice to someone, but then  when you see an opportunity perhaps to get something you want you will st ab that person in the back.  You will do something mean – something bad to th em in order for you to get what you want.  The verb we would use here is “to b etray” (betray); “to betray (someone),” to do something that the other person is no t expecting in order to hurt them after you have been nice to them.  Literally,  “to stab someone in the back” would be to take a knife and put it into the back o f the person, obviously trying to kill them.

Floriane says, “I don’t get that feeling from Terry.”  She doesn’t agree with Javier. She says, “He seemed genuine and open.”  “To be genuine ” means to be real, to be true.  Here, really it means to be sincere; someone  who is “sincere” is telling the truth, means what they say.  “Open” here means willi ng to share information with another person, not hiding anything.  The word “ open” has a couple of different meanings, as does the word “upfront,” which w e talked about earlier. Those can be found in our Learning Guide.

 Floriane says, “By the way, was there something you needed (Javier)?”  Javier says, “Me?  No.  I was just trying to watch out for you.”   “To watch out for (someone)” means to do something to protect the other  person, to keep them safe.  Floriane says, “In that case, I’d better get back to work (since you don’t want anything else), and I’ll keep your warning in mind .”  A “warning” is when someone tells you about something that could go wrong, so me potential problem. She says, “I’ll beware of anyone giving me advice who may h ave an ulterior motive.”  “To beware of (someone)” is a phrasal verb m eaning to be careful or to be cautious because you know there is a possible danger in this situation.

What we, of course, think here is that Javier is romantic ally interested in Floriane, and he doesn’t like another man in the office trying to  get close to her.  Floriane realizes this, and at the end of the dialogue says, “I’ll  beware of anyone giving me advice who may have an ulterior motive,” meaning, of course, that Javier has an ulterior motive.  He isn’t just trying to protect Fl oriane; he’s trying to get her to be romantically interested in him.  I think he will pro bably succeed, and one day they’ll get married!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Javier:  I saw Terry cozying up to you this morning.  What was that about?

Floriane:  He was just offering me some advice on my fi rst proposal.

Javier:  Sure, he was.  What were his true intentions?

Floriane:  I think he was being upfront about wanting  to help a new employee.  I don’t think he had an ulterior motive.

Javier:  I wouldn’t take Terry at face value.  He has a re putation around the office of being two-faced.  He’ll try to get to know you under  false pretenses and then stab you in the back.

Floriane:  I don’t get that feeling from Terry.  He seemed genuine and open.  By the way, was there something you needed?

Javier:  Me?  No.  I was just trying to watch out for you.

Floriane:  In that case, I’d better get back to work, an d I’ll keep your warning in mind.  I’ll beware of anyone giving me advice who may ha ve an ulterior motive.

# Sharing With Others

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 6 41: Sharing With Others.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 641.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Sharing With Others.”  It’s a dia logue between Benny and Julia with a lot of vocabulary related to sharing things with other people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Benny:  Mom says we’re supposed to share.

Julia:  I know.  I’m divvying up the candy right now.  Just  hold your horses.

Benny:  I want to do it.  I want to make sure I get my fair share.

Julia:  I called dibs on dividing up the candy, remember?   You snooze you lose.

Benny:  That’s not fair!  I wasn’t here when Mom came home.

Julia:  Bummer for you.  Okay, I’m done.  Here’s your sh are and here’s mine.

Benny:  Hey, the two piles aren’t equal.  You definite ly got the lion’s share.  You do that to me every time.  That’s not fair!

Julia:  What are you going to do about it?

Benny:  I’m going to tell!

Julia:  You’re such a baby.  Okay, if you don’t run to M om, I’ll let you call shotgun the next time we go anywhere in the car.

Benny:  You will?  You promise?

 Julia:  I cross my heart and hope to die.  Okay?

Benny:  All right, but I still want my fair share of t he candy.

Julia:  Okay, I’ve evened out the piles.  Satisfied?

Benny:  Yeah.  And can I do the divvying up next time?

Julia:  Don’t push your luck!

[end of dialogue]

Benny and Julia are clearly children in our dialogue.  B enny says to Julia, “Mom says we’re supposed to share.”  Of course he says that Mom says,  that gives him some authority.  “To share” means to let someone else hav e or use something that belongs to you, or part of something that belongs to you.

Julia says, “I know.  I’m divvying up the candy right now.  Just hold your horses.” “To divvy (divvy) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to divide something or group of something into two smaller groups or three sm aller groups – at least two.  You’re deciding how something is going to be sha red or distributed.  It could be money; here it’s candy.  You could also talk about divvyi ng up the work on a project: I’ll do this part, you do that part.  Julia te lls Benny to just hold his horses. “To hold your horses” is an informal phrase used to ask som eone to be more patient, to wait.  It’s sort of a thing that you would  say to perhaps a friend, a family member.  It’s also implying that you are being im patient.  If someone keeps asking you questions over and over again, and they don’ t stop, and you tell them, “Just hold your horses, will you?” you’re sayin g, in a way, stop bothering me so much, wait, I’ll tell you when I’m rea dy.  That’s the idea here.

Benny says, “I want to do it (meaning I want to divvy up t he candy).  I want to make sure I get my fair share.”  “To get your fair (fair ) share” means to get everything that you should receive, that you’re supposed to receive; to get what is, we would say, coming to you – that is, what belongs to  you or should belong to you.

Julia says, “I called dibs on dividing up the candy, rememb er?  You snooze you lose.”  “To call dibs” (dibs) is a very common phrase used especially by children. It means I get to use this thing, or I get to have thi s thing, and you cannot have it. For example, you are renting a hotel room with a fri end and there are two beds. You walk into the hotel room and you say, “I call dibs on the bed near the window.”  Notice the preposition “on,” which usually app ears after this phrase.

 Julia says, “I called dibs on dividing up the candy.”  “Divi ding” here is the same as “divvying up.”  To call dibs is something children do a lot.  For example, if you are driving in a car and there are several children, as w as the case when I was a child, if there were five or six, even seven of us going i n the car, someone would call dibs on the front seat.  They would say, “I get to g o to the front seat.”  This is typically done before the action is going to take place –  that is, before the event. Although mostly popular among children, this expression is still heard among adults today.  I’ve heard it; probably used it!

Julia says to Benny, “You snooze you lose,” you can also say “ if you snooze you lose.”  “To snooze” (snooze) means to fall asleep.  The i dea of “you snooze you lose” means that if you are late or if you wait too lon g you may miss the opportunity to do something or to get something.  So, if the children come home and there’s a cake or a pie sitting on the table and the children immediately go and cut themselves a piece, then another child comes five mi nutes later and there’s no more cake or pie left, one of the children m ay say to the person – to the kid who arrived late, “You snooze you lose.”  You wer e late therefore you missed the opportunity to do something, or in this case, t o eat something.

Julia was the first to call dibs on divvying up the candy, a nd now it’s too late for Benny to say that he wants to do it.  Benny says, “That’s n ot fair (that’s not right; that’s not reasonable)!”  “Fair” (fair) has a lot of d ifferent meanings, some of those can be found in our Learning Guide.  Benny says, “I  wasn’t here when Mom came home.”  In other words, when the candy arrived he wasn’t there to call dibs.  Julia says basically that’s too bad; she says, “Bumm er for you.”  A “bummer” (bummer) is a popular informal word used to show disappointment. It’s the same as “too bad,” but it’s a little more info rmal.  You still hear this expression, or this word quite a bit.  I don’t think it is as popular as it was maybe 20-25 years ago, but you will still hear it quite a bit .  “That’s a bummer,” you could say, or simply, “bummer.”

In this case, Julia says, “Bummer for you.  Okay, I’m done .  Here’s your share and here’s mine.”  Benny says, “Hey, the two piles aren’t  equal.”  A “pile” (pile) is a group of things, one on top of the other.  You coul d have a pile of clothing: you put a shirt and then on top of that you put some pan ts and then socks and then underwear and so forth.  That would be a pile of clot hing.  You could have a pile of newspapers, or a pile of papers on your desk.  This is a  pile of candy, but the piles are not equal.  “Pile” has a couple of other mea nings as well.  Once again, the Learning Guide will help you with those.  “To be  equal” means to be the same, and what Benny is saying is that his pile of candy is obviously not as big as Julia’s pile.  Then he also complains that Julia defin itely got the lion’s share. A “lion” is an animal; you’ve probably seen them on tele vision or in a zoo.  The

 “lion’s share,” however, means the larger part of someth ing, the majority, more than 50 percent.  Julia and Benny, in other words, did not split the candy equally – I should say Julia did not split it equally.  She gave herself the lion’s share – the biggest part.

Benny says, “You do that to me every time.  That’s not fai r!”  Julia says, “What are you going to do about it (how are you going to cha nge the situation)?”  Benny says, “I’m going to tell!”  “To tell,” in this dialogue , means to let someone know about something bad the other person has done.  This is typically – this meaning is typically one you would find among children.  If a lit tle child says, “I’m going to tell,” he means I’m going to tell on you; I’m going t o tell Mom or Dad that you did something wrong.

Julia says, “You’re such a baby.  Okay, if you don’t run to Mom (if you don’t go tell Mom what I did), I’ll let you call shotgun the n ext time we go anywhere in the car.”  “To call shotgun” (shotgun – one word) means to  say that you are going to ride in the front seat of the car – not the driver’s sea t, but the other seat, which we sometimes call the shotgun seat.  I’m not sure exactly why.  I guess if you were going hunting or going to kill someone, the perso n who wasn’t driving would be holding the gun.  That’s all I can think of.  In an y case, “to call” is the same here as “to call dibs on.”  “To call shotgun” means I get  to sit in the front of the car.  Again, it’s something that you would find especial ly among children, but adults could use this expression as well.  “To call” means I  get to do that, and the first person who calls shotgun is the person who gets to ride in the front seat.

Julia says that she will let Benny sit in the front seat n ext time.  Benny says, “You will?  You promise?”  Julia responds, “I cross my heart and  hope to die.”  “To cross your heart and hope to die” is a promise; it’s an in formal phrase, again often used by children to show that they are being hone st, that they really mean what they are saying.  “I cross my heart and hope to die, ” you’re saying you must believe me, I am telling you the truth.

Benny says, “All right, but I still want my fair share o f the candy.”  Julia says, “Okay, I’ve evened out the piles.”  “To even out” is a ph rasal verb meaning to make two things equal in size; in this case, the two piles of candy.  Then Julia says, “Satisfied?” meaning are you happy now, are you sati sfied Benny.  Benny says, “Yeah.  And can I do the divvying up next time?”  So  now he’s asking for something else; he wants to be the one to divide the can dy the next time there is candy.  Julia says, “Don’t push your luck!”  “To push your luck” is a phrase meaning to ask for too much, to ask for too many things es pecially after you have already asked for something.  So you go to your boss and yo u say, “Boss, I want a raise: a dollar an hour.”  The boss says, “Okay.”  And t hen you say, “I also want

 two more weeks of vacation.”  Your boss may say, “Don’t push  your luck,” meaning you’ve already asked for something, don’t keep aski ng for something else.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Benny:  Mom says we’re supposed to share.

Julia:  I know.  I’m divvying up the candy right now.  Just  hold your horses.

Benny:  I want to do it.  I want to make sure I get my fair share.

Julia:  I called dibs on dividing up the candy, remember?   You snooze you lose.

Benny:  That’s not fair!  I wasn’t here when Mom came home.

Julia:  Bummer for you.  Okay, I’m done.  Here’s your sh are and here’s mine.

Benny:  Hey, the two piles aren’t equal.  You definite ly got the lion’s share.  You do that to me every time.  That’s not fair!

Julia:  What are you going to do about it?

Benny:  I’m going to tell!

Julia:  You’re such a baby.  Okay, if you don’t run to M om, I’ll let you call shotgun the next time we go anywhere in the car.

Benny:  You will?  You promise?

Julia:  I cross my heart and hope to die.  Okay?

Benny:  All right, but I still want my fair share of t he candy.

Julia:  Okay, I’ve evened out the piles.  Satisfied?

Benny:  Yeah.  And can I do the divvying up next time?

Julia:  Don’t push your luck!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 42: Installing Windows and Doors.

This episode is called “Installing Windows and Doors,” so let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vern:  I really think we’ve bitten off more than we can  chew.  I like do-it-yourself projects, but installing a new window and a new door i sn’t as easy as it looks.

Genevive:  What we don’t know, we’ll learn as we go.  Okay, we’ve removed the old window.  This new double-paned one is going to be  great and it’ll slide open and close easily, unlike the old one.  We just need to pu t in a new frame first, and then we can move it into place.

Vern:  You make it sound so easy.  Is the screen going to  fit?  It looks too big.

Genevive:  Oh sure, it’ll fit.

Vern:  This latch doesn’t seem to be working.

Genevive:  It’ll work once it’s installed.  Come on, give  me a hand.  Hmm…the new window doesn’t seem to fit exactly.  I’m not sure w hat the problem is.  Let me think about it.  Let’s move on to the door and come back to it later.

Vern:  Are you sure?

Genevive:  Sure, I’m sure.  Installing the new door wil l be easier and we can get it out of the way.

 Vern:  Maybe we should wait until the window is install ed.  If we can’t finish installing the window and the door before nightfall,  it’ll be a very cold night in the house.

Genevive:  Don’t worry.  Let’s see, first we have to remove  the old door without damaging the jamb.  The hinges are rusted; it seems to be stuck.  Oh, I think it’s finally coming off.

Vern:  See?  Replacing the door isn’t going to be as e asy as you thought, is it?

Genevive:  I got it off in the end, didn’t I?

Vern:  Yes, but will you be able to put in the new on e before I die of frostbite?

[end of dialogue]

Vern and Genevive are “installing,” or putting in new windows and doors in their house.  Vern begins by saying, “I really think we’ve bitten  off more than we can chew.”  This is an old expression.  “To bite off (bitten is the past tense of bite – actually, it’s the past participle but we won’t go into that now) more than you can chew” – “to bite off more than you can chew.”  This expr ession means to try to do something that is too difficult for you to do, or for yo u to finish.  “To bite” means to typically use your teeth when you are eating food.  You ca n take a bite out of an apple for example; you put the apple in your mouth an d you take a piece.  “To chew” means to move your jaw up down so that the food go es in between your teeth and you’re able to swallow it.  But this expression  means that you, in a sense, have taken or bitten off too much and you can’t po ssibly chew it.  Again, it’s a general expression to mean you try to do something  that is too big or too difficult.

Vern says, “I like do-it-yourself projects, but installing a new window and a new door isn’t as easy as it looks.”  “Do-it-yourself,” sometim es abbreviated “DIY,” is when you do something typically around your house, such as ma king a desk or building a table.  In other words, you don’t pay some one else to do it or buy it; you do it yourself.  So, a “do-it-yourself project” would  be for example trying to install a new window.  “To install” means to put someth ing into something else or to put something onto something else so that it can be u sed.  When you buy a new water heater, to make your water hot, you have to install it.  You have to take it out of the box, put it where it belongs, conne ct the water, the electricity or the gas, and so forth.  That’s to install.  We use this verb a lot; we even use it in the computer world.  We talk about installing software , that’s putting the software onto your computer so you can use it.

 Vern doesn’t think that a new window or a new door is as easy as it looks, meaning you look at it and you think oh, that won’t be  very difficult but then when you try to do it, it is very difficult.  Genevive says, “What we don’t know, we’ll learn as we go.”  “To learn as you go” means to learn t hrough experience, learn through doing.  You don’t take a class, you don’t read a book, you just do it and you learn as you are doing whatever it is you are doing.   That’s to learn as you go.

Genevive, of course, thinks that they can install this new window and new door. She says, “Okay, we’ve removed (we’ve gotten rid of; we too k out) the old window.  This new double-paned one is going to be gre at and it’ll slide open and close easily, unlike the old one.”  So Vern and Genevive a re trying to install a double-paned window.  “Double-paned” (paned) is when  you have a window with two pieces of glass very close to each other, but there’s a small amount of air – sometimes there’s a special gas they use – between the two pieces of glass. What this does is it makes the window thicker, or more imp ortantly, it makes it so that you don’t hear what’s going on outside, or at lea st you hear less of what’s going on outside.  I, for example, need a double-pane d window in my house so that I don’t hear the children outside.  Or I can do what I usually do, which is go outside and tell the little kids to be quiet.  I’m tha t nice kind of neighbor, you know!

So, Genevive says that the double-paned window is going t o be great.  She says, “it’ll slide open and close easily.”  “To slide” (slide) m eans to move smoothly in one direction, typically when you are rubbing against some thing else.  I could take a glass of water and slide it across the table; I pu sh it so that moves smoothly across the table.  In this case, the windows are going to slide open and close easily, “unlike the old one,” meaning the old one did not do that.  Genevive says, “We just need to put in a new frame first, and the n we can move it into place.”  The “frame” (frame) is the square or rectangul ar shape usually made of wood or metal that goes around something; in this case,  it goes around the window.  You could also have a picture frame, which is the part that you see on the very outside – on all four sides – that holds the pict ure in place.

Vern says, “You make it sound so easy.  Is the screen going to fit?  It looks too big.”  A “screen” is something that you put behind a doo r or a window so that you can open the door or window and no bugs or flies will come in.  It’s usually made of metal or plastic with lots of small holes in it.  Ge nevive says, “Oh sure, it’ll fit,” meaning it will be able to be put here, the space wil l be right, it will not be too big. Vern says, “This latch doesn’t seem to be working.”  A “la tch” is a small piece of metal that you move to hold something closed or to let it be open.  So on a

 window, you typically have a little latch that when you mo ve it in a certain direction allows you to open the window; when you move it in a different direction, it will keep the window closed.  That’s a lat ch (latch).

Vern doesn’t think the latch is working, but Genevive says, “ It’ll work once it’s installed.  Come on, give me a hand.”  “To give (some one) a hand” means to help them do something, usually something physical like movi ng boxes or installing windows.  Genevive says, “Hmm (she’s uncertain abo ut something or she’s surprised by something)…the new window doesn’t seem to  fit exactly,” meaning it doesn’t go in the space perfectly; it must be  too big or too small.  “I’m not sure what the problem is,” she says, “Let me think abo ut it.  Let’s move on to the door (let’s start working on the door now) and come  back to the window later.”  Vern says, “Are you sure?”  Genevive says, “Sure, I’ m sure (meaning yes I am sure; I am certain).  Installing the new door wil l be easier and we can get it out of the way.”  “To get (something) out of the way”  means to do something that you don’t really like first; do it immediately so that you  can forget about it and go on to do something that you like better.  That’s to ge t something out of the way.

Vern says, “Maybe we should wait until the window is inst alled.  If we can’t finish installing the window and the door before nightfall,  it’ll be a very cold night in this house.”  “Nightfall” (one word) is the time when, or at the time when the sun sets; the time between afternoon and evening, when the sky be gins to go dark.  That’s nightfall.

Vern says that if they don’t get the window and door in stalled they’re going to be cold tonight.  Genevive says, “Don’t worry.  Let’s see, fir st we have to remove the old door without damaging the jamb” (jamb).  The “j amb” is one of the vertical pieces of wood on the sides of the window or the door; they could also be made of metal.  She says, “The hinges are rusted; it seems to b e stuck.”  A “hinge” is a small piece of metal that attaches the door to the door jamb; it allows the door to open and close.  It’s what connects the door typically to the “doorjamb,” or the permanent, unmovable part of the doorframe.  When som ething is “rusted” we mean that it has an orange or red dust on it that is so metimes created when metal gets wet.  The technical term would be “oxidized.”   So what happens is the hinges are rusted, and that makes it difficult to open t he door, that’s why Genevive says the door seems to be stuck.  When something is “st uck” (stuck) you cannot move it or open it; it is something that you can’t change because there’s some problem.

Genevive says, “Oh, I think it’s finally coming off.”  Vern says, “See?  Replacing the door isn’t going to be as easy as you thought?”  But Genevive doesn’t give up, she says, “I got it off in the end, didn’t I?”  “In  the end” means finally; after

 some work I did get the door off.  Vern says, “Yes, but w ill you be able to put in the new one (the new door) before I die of frostbite  (frostbite – one word)?” “Frostbite” is a condition where your fingers or your toe s, typically, are too cold and it starts damage your skin; it can even lead to damag e to your fingers and toes.  If you live in a northern climate – that is, a pl ace where it gets cold during the winter, you probably know about frostbite.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vern:  I really think we’ve bitten off more than we can  chew.  I like do-it-yourself projects, but installing a new window and a new door i sn’t as easy as it looks.

Genevive:  What we don’t know, we’ll learn as we go.  Okay, we’ve removed the old window.  This new double-paned one is going to be  great and it’ll slide open and close easily, unlike the old one.  We just need to pu t in a new frame first, and then we can move it into place.

Vern:  You make it sound so easy.  Is the screen going to  fit?  It looks too big.

Genevive:  Oh sure, it’ll fit.

Vern:  This latch doesn’t seem to be working.

Genevive:  It’ll work once it’s installed.  Come on, give  me a hand.  Hmm…the new window doesn’t seem to fit exactly.  I’m not sure w hat the problem is.  Let me think about it.  Let’s move on to the door and come back to it later.

Vern:  Are you sure?

Genevive:  Sure, I’m sure.  Installing the new door wil l be easier and we can get it out of the way.

Vern:  Maybe we should wait until the window is install ed.  If we can’t finish installing the window and the door before nightfall,  it’ll be a very cold night in the house.

Genevive:  Don’t worry.  Let’s see, first we have to remove  the old door without damaging the jamb.  The hinges are rusted; it seems to be stuck.  Oh, I think it’s finally coming off.

 Vern:  See?  Replacing the door isn’t going to be as e asy as you thought, is it?

Genevive:  I got it off in the end, didn’t I?

Vern:  Yes, but will you be able to put in the new on e before I die of frostbite?

This episode is called “Liberal and Conservative News.”  It  will use a lot of vocabulary that is used in American politics and media to describe two different philosophical views of the way the government should work .  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bill:  Why are you reading that rag?

Rachel:  I enjoy reading it.  I like its news coverage an d its incisive commentaries.

Bill:  That’s nothing but a liberal propaganda rag.  You can’t believe a thing they print in there.

Rachel:  That’s not true.  The news stories are objective and unbiased.  This magazine isn’t like the newspapers and news websites you rea d.  Those are run by ultraconservative reactionaries, who only know how to w rite diatribes.  If I only read the news sources you read, I would think that this w orld was being ruled by liberals.

Bill:  The world is being ruled by liberals, at least b y the liberal press.

Rachel:  You’ve got to be kidding!  Our politics and our  financial system are run by staunch conservatives, who ignore any point of view other  than their own. Those of us who are enlightened…

Bill:  You call yourselves enlightened?  All you and your dyed-in-the-wool liberals want to do is to tear down old traditions.

 Rachel:  Yes, we do want to tear down old traditions, old traditions that keep us from making progress toward…

Sophia:  Mom, Dad, what’s going on in here?  Why are you yelling?

Rachel:  Oh, it’s nothing, honey.  Go back to sleep.  Y our Dad and I are just having a friendly little talk.

[end of dialogue]

I’m not going to try to explain to you the differences between liberals and conservatives politically here in the United States, that w ould require several English Cafés.  Generally speaking, if you know something a bout American politics, you can understand the difference by understandin g the difference between Democrats, who are typically liberal, and Repub licans who are typically conservative.

Well, this is a dialogue between Bill and Rachel.  Bil l says to Rachel, “Why are you reading that rag (rag)?”  A “rag,” in this sense, i s a poor quality newspaper, a newspaper that is not reliable, often because it is very p olitically biased.  That is, it only reports the news from one political view.  “Rag”  has a couple of different other meanings in English, and those are found in, of course, the Learning Guide.

Rachel says, “I enjoy reading it.  I like its news coverage a nd its incisive commentaries.”  “News coverage” are the stories that app ear in the newspaper or that are talked about in a magazine or on radio or  television.  “Coverage” is a general term to describe how much of something is includ ed, so this is how much news and what kind of news is included in the newspaper.  Rachel also likes the newspaper’s incisive commentaries.  A “commentary” is somethi ng that is written or spoken about an idea, sometimes while it is happenin g, sometimes after the fact.  Most newspapers, at least in the United States, ha ve commentary by different writers that represent different political  views.  When something is “incisive” (incisive) we mean that the person who wrote it  understands something very well; it demonstrates the intelligence of the perso n and their ability to understand something.  She means that newspaper.

Liberal, as I said before, is a political philosophy that  in modern American terms tends to want to have larger government programs, where as conservatives tend to want to have a smaller government presence.  Again, I don’t want to talk too much about that because it’s impossible to summarize it in  a short amount of time.

 Bill calls the newspaper a liberal propaganda rag.  “P ropaganda” is information that is often false that is used to try to persuade peop le to believe in a particular idea or action, especially in politics.  Bill is saying th at this newspaper is not objective – it’s not giving you the news without any sort o f bias.  Instead, it is a liberal propaganda rag; it is trying to promote a cert ain political philosophy.  He says, “You can’t believe a thing (meaning you can’t believe  anything) they print in there.”  “To print” here means to publish something usu ally in a newspaper, magazine, or book.

Rachel says, “That’s not true.  The news stories are object ive and unbiased.” Rachel is defending her newspaper, saying that it is “obj ective,” meaning it’s based on the facts, it’s not just opinion.  She also says it’s “unbiased,” which is the opposite of biased – not biased.  If something is “ biased,” it has one point of view and it only reflects one point of view – one philoso phy, in this case. “Unbiased” would be something that is objective, it doesn ’t take one side of the argument over another.  Rachel says that this magazine – a nd I guess I thought she was reading a newspaper – “This magazine isn’t like the newspapers and news websites you read.  Those are run by (those are opera ted by) ultraconservative reactionaries, who only know how to write  diatribes.”  There are lots of terms, some of them insulting terms, that are us ed in American politics to describe each side of the political spectrum – each side of the political range of views.  When you say someone is an “ultraconservative,” you me an they are very, very conservative – extremely conservative, too conservati ve really.  A “reactionary” is someone who doesn’t like change and want s to go, often, back in time, without even understanding completely what’s goin g on today.  Again, this is a term that liberals in the U.S. would use to describ e conservatives and make them seem extreme.

Conservatives have their own words to describe liberals; man y times they’ll talk about the “far left”; you can also talk about the “far right.”  The far left would be people who are very extreme in their liberal views.  Con servatives would also use terms like the “loony left.”  “Loony” (loony) means sort o f crazy, in this case.  So, each side has its own insulting terms that it likes to use.   Those people who are in the middle, who are not liberal or conservative, we  call “moderates” or “middle of the road,” they’re not too far on either side.

Rachel says that the magazines and newspapers that Bill rea ds only write diatribes.  A “diatribe” (diatribe) is a long written  or spoken attack on someone. When you are criticizing someone, you take a long time an d you really attack or criticize everything about that person or that view.  Rach el says, “If I only read

 the news sources you read, I would think that this world w as being ruled by liberals.”

Bill says, “The world is being ruled by liberals, at least  by the liberal press.” “Press” here means the same as media: newspapers, magazine s, radio, television, websites that are related to the news or tha t report the news.  “Press” however has several other meanings, and those can be found  in our Learning Guide.

Rachel says, “You’ve got to be kidding (meaning you’re joki ng, right)!  Our politics and our financial system are run by staunch conservati ves, who ignore any point of view other than their own.”  “Staunch” (st aunch) means very loyal, someone who is strongly supporting a certain political posi tion.  Rachel says that our politics and our financial system are run by staunch con servatives, who ignore any point of view – any opinion – other than th eir own.  “Those of us who are enlightened…”  “To be enlightened” means to have a good understanding of something, sometimes associated with perhaps more modern w ays of thinking.

Bill says, “You call yourselves enlightened?  All you and yo ur dyed-in-the-wool liberals want is to tear down old traditions.”  The ph rase “dyed (dyed)-in-the-wool (wool)” means completely involved in, extreme.  So if you  are a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, you are completely liberal, you are 100 percent  liberal.  “Wool,” you may know, is what you get from sheep that you can make clothin g from.  “Dyed” means that it is colored; you change the color of the wo ol by putting the wool into a dye, some sort of typically liquid substance.  Bill says tha t the dyed-in-the-wool liberals want to tear down old traditions.  “To tear (tear) down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to destroy, to ruin, to take apart.   “Tradition” is the way that something has always been done by a particular culture or  a particular group of people.

Rachel says, “Yes, we do want to tear down old tradition s, old traditions that keep us (or prevent us) from making progress toward…”  Sud denly we hear from Sophia, who is Bill and Rachel’s daughter; she says, “Mom , Dad, what’s going on here?  Why are you yelling?”  Sophia sounds a lot like Ra chel because, of course, they’re related, right?  Rachel says, “Oh, it’s no thing, honey.  Go back to sleep.  Your Dad and I are just having a friendly littl e talk.”  So, the daughter wants to know why her parents are arguing, and the mot her tells her just to go back to sleep.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

 Bill:  Why are you reading that rag?

# Giving a Successful Presentation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 44: Giving a Successful Presentation.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 644.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You know what to do – go the re and download a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is called “Giving a Successful Presentation.”  I t contains lots of vocabulary related to giving a speech or presentation, so let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Event organizer:  Do you hear that?  It’s a packed house  and your presentation was a hit.  People are clamoring for more.

Herman:  I can’t believe it.  I wasn’t expecting that ki nd of reception.  The audience really seemed to like it.

Event organizer:  Like it?  They were on the edge of th eir seats.

Herman:  The presentation actually started slowly, but it  seemed to gain traction in the middle.

Event organizer:  You had the audience hooked from the  start.  You could have heard a pin drop in there when you were going over you r main points.  Your presentation is undoubtedly the highlight of the confer ence.

Herman:  Thanks.  I’m still in shock.  Maybe if I tweaked it a little, I could give this presentation at the national conference.

Event organizer:  You’ll have time later to think abou t that.  Right now, you need to get out there for the Q&A.  They’re waiting for yo u.

Herman:  But I don’t have anything else to say.

Event organizer:  Just get out there.  Your adoring pub lic is waiting for you!

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the event organizer, the pers on who is in charge of or who is running this particular event where the presentat ion is going to be made, she says to Herman, the person who is going to give the pr esentation – the presenter, “Did you hear that?  It’s a packed house and your presentation was a hit.”  A “packed (packed) house” is when you have a very la rge audience, lots of people who come and they take up every seat in the pla ce where the event is being held.  Sometimes we say there’s “standing room onl y,” meaning there are no more places to sit because there are so many people the re.  That’s a packed house.  It doesn’t mean that it’s a house that you live in.  The word “house” here just refers to the place – the auditorium or stadium wh ere the event is taking place.

The event organizer says that Herman’s presentation was a  hit.  To say something is “a hit” means that it is very successful; it was very popular.  We talk about hit songs or hit movies; these are songs and movi es that are very popular. “Hit” has a number of other definitions; take a look at  our Learning Guide for those.  Finally the event organizer says, “People are clam oring for more.”  “To clamor” (clamor) means to ask for something but in a very l oud way, to make a lot of noise demanding or insisting that something happ en.  The people are clamoring for more, they’re wanting Herman to do more  of his presentation or to make the presentation longer – to continue it.

Herman says, “I can’t believe it.  I wasn’t expecting that  kind (or that type) of reception.”  “Reception” comes from the verb “to receive .”  It’s a noun meaning the way or the manner in which something is received, the  way people react to something or react to someone.  The presentation got a  good reception; it was “well received” we might also say.

“The audience,” Herman says, the people who were listen ing, “seemed to like it.” The event organizer says, “Like it?  They were on the ed ge of their seats.”  She says “like it” meaning they didn’t just like it, they loved it.  “They were on the edge (edge) of their seats.”  The “seat” is where you sit in  an auditorium or a stadium. The “edge” is at the very end or border, if you will, of the seat.  It’s where your body is just barely on the seat.  The expression “to be on the edge of your seat” means that you are so interested, you’re so eager to hear  or see something that you may be sitting up in your seat, almost like you’re abou t to stand up.  That’s to be on the edge of one’s seat.  Herman says, “The presenta tion actually started slowly, but it seemed to gain traction in the middle.”  The expression “to gain traction” (traction) means to have more success, to get bett er.  To begin to be more well received, that’s to gain traction.

 The event organizer says, “You had the audience hooked fr om the start.”  “To be hooked” (hooked) means to like something and need someth ing, you want more of it; you like it and you want even more.  This could b e true in, for example, someone who is using certain drugs.  They may be hooked on – notice the preposition we use, “on” – hooked on a certain drug.  The other words here would be “addicted,” especially if you are talking about drugs.  However, to be “hooked” or “hooked on (something)” is an expression we can use for just about anything.  In this case, Herman had the audience hooked; in other words, the audience was very interested.  They needed and wanted mo re from the start – from the very beginning of his presentation.  She says, “Y ou could have heard a pin drop in there.”  The expression “you could have heard  a pin drop” means that it is a situation where everyone is quiet because they are  interested in something; they want to hear what will happen next.  W hen someone makes an announcement in front of a group of people that is ver y important, everyone will be quiet and listen.  That’s where you could hear a pi n drop.  Well, this is the past tense, so the event organizer says, “You could have heard a  pin drop,” it was that quiet.  It was so quiet you could hear a pin dropping  on the floor.  A “pin,” I should mention is a small piece of usually metal that you put in to something – you stick into something, usually to keep something in place.  For example, you may have an announcement – a piece of paper, and you take a kind of pin called a “push pin,” and you put into the wood or you put it into the board so that the announcement – the piece of paper stays.  Well that’s a p in; it’s a small, sharp piece of metal that goes into something.

You could have heard a pin drop when Herman was “going  over,” or talking about, his “main points,” the main or most important t hings in the speech.  She says to Herman, “Your presentation is undoubtedly the hig hlight of the conference.”  “Undoubtedly” means clearly, without a dou bt, obviously.  A “highlight” is the best part of something, the most int eresting or beautiful or important part of something.  You could say, “I went t o Rome, and the highlight of my trip was to see Michelangelo’s Pietà,” that’s the high light, that was the best part.

Herman says, “Thanks.  I’m still in shock.”  “To be in shock”  means to be very surprised by something, unable to fully understand it an d sometimes accept it. You can be in shock over a good thing; you can be in shock over a bad thing. This is definitely a good thing.  Herman says, “Maybe if I  tweaked it a little, I could give this presentation at the national conference.”   This may be a conference or a meeting for a given city or state, but H erman thinks if he “tweaked” his presentation, meaning if he improved it, if he made some small

 changes while leaving most of it the same, but making sma ll changes to improve it, then he could go on to a bigger conference.

The organizer says, “You’ll have time later to think abou t that.  Right now, you need to get out there for the Q&A.”  “Q” stands for q uestion; “A” stands for answer.  The “Q&A” is something that happens at the end  of many presentations, where the people who are listening to you – your audi ence – gets a chance to ask you questions about your topic.

Herman says, “But I don’t have anything else to say.”  the event organizer says, “Just get out there (meaning go out back in front of the people).  Your adoring public is waiting for you!”  “To adore” means to like o r admire someone or something.  Here, it’s used modify “public,” which are the people – the people who listen to you or who watch you.  So, your “adoring p ublic” are the people who adore you, who love you, who want to see more of you .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Event organizer:  Do you hear that?  It’s a packed house  and your presentation was a hit.  People are clamoring for more.

Herman:  I can’t believe it.  I wasn’t expecting that ki nd of reception.  The audience really seemed to like it.

Event organizer:  Like it?  They were on the edge of th eir seats.

# Shaving Your Face

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 45: Shaving Your Face.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 645.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development, right here in Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Lear ning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English – and m ake your day a little happier!

This episode is called “Shaving Your Face.”  It’s a story ab out me shaving; that is, removing hair from my face.  Let’s get started. > I forgot to set my alarm last night and I woke up later  than usual.  I was tempted to skip my morning shave, but I hate having long stubble a ll day.  I like to be clean-shaven every day.  I’m the kind of guy who gets a fiv e-o’clock shadow early in the afternoon, so if I skipped my morning shave, I’d look like I was growing a beard by the end of the day.
> I went into the bathroom and picked up my shaving cream.  I lathered up my face and checked to see that my razor was sharp and that I didn’ t need to replace the razor blades.  There’s nothing worse than trying to shave with a dull razor.  I tried using an electric razor for a while, but I could never get a close enough shave.
> I tried to focus on shaving my neck, chin, and cheeks.  I was in too much of a hurry, though, and nicked myself on the neck.  I hate it w hen that happens!  I knew I was in too much of a hurry, but I was going to b e really late.  Oh, I did it again!  This time I nicked myself on the chin.  “Okay,” I said to myself, “slow down.  You’d rather be a little late to work than to  end up with a face full of potholes, right?”

I begin the story by saying that I forgot to set my alarm last night.  “To set your alarm” is to change the settings on your alarm clock so that  it makes a loud noise at the time you want to get up.  Most of us have some so rt of alarm clock next to our beds that helps us wake up with a loud noise or per haps music.  The verb we

 use it is “to set” (set) your alarm.  Well, I forgot to  set my alarm, which means that the alarm clock did not ring – notice the verb “ring” w ith alarm clocks – and therefore I woke up later than usual.  In real life I rarely use an alarm clock; I’m almost always up early, around 5:30-6:00, but if it’s som ething very important then I might use my alarm clock if I’m traveling and need  to get up very early.

I say that I was tempted to skip my morning shave.  “To be  tempted” is to have a strong desire usually to do something bad, something tha t you know you should not do.  “The chocolate cookies tempted me,” I really wan ted to eat one even though I didn’t need the extra sugar and fat.  Well,  I was tempted “to skip,” meaning not to do something I normally do, my morning shave.  “Shave” is removing the hair usually from your face, or it could be  from some other part of your body.  Many women shave their legs, for example.  I shave my head in addition to my face – that is, the top of my head.  So,  “I was tempted to skip my morning shave, but I hate having long stubble all day.”   “Stubble” (stubble) are very short pieces of hair that grow usually on your face aft er you shave.  So you shave your face, and then the next day you’ll have very litt le pieces of hair; we call that hair stubble, especially if it is something tha t appears right after you shave.  “I hate having long stubble all day,” I said, “I  like (instead) to be clean- shaven.”  “Shaven” is “shave” with an “n” at the end; it ’s the past participle. “Clean-shaven” is an adjective meaning that my skin is smoo th; I don’t have any hair coming out of my body where I shaved.  So, clean-sha ven is that you completely removed the hair by shaving it.

I say that I’m the kind of guy (I’m the type of man) who  gets a five-o’clock shadow early in the afternoon.  A “five-o’clock shadow” means th at you get a dark color on your face by the end of the day because your hair is a lready growing back. “Five o’clock” would mean five o’clock in the afternoon, so  that by the time you are finished working you already look like you need to sh ave; some men grow their hair very quickly.  Truth is I’m not actually someone  who would get a five- o’clock shadow early in the afternoon, but that’s what the story says.  I continue saying, “if I skipped my morning shave, I’d look like I was growing a beard by the end of the day.”  A “beard” (beard) is something you g et by letting your hair on your face grow, not shaving it.  It especially refers to the hair on the cheeks and around the jaw, as well as on the upper neck.  The hai r immediately underneath your nose would be called a “mustache” (mustache).  So, we  sometimes refer to these together; some men have a beard and a mustache, som e people just have a mustache, and there are some men who just have a bea rd or a small beard that has become popular.  By the way, in British English  “mustache,” like a lot of words, is spelled slightly differently; there’s an “o” in the word – (mou) instead of just (mu).  In American English there’s no “o”.

 I say that I went into the bathroom and picked up my shavi ng cream.  “Shaving cream” is something that you put typically on your face or w herever you are shaving so that it’s easier to remove the hair; it makes the hair a little softer, it makes it easier for you to shave it.  Shaving cream is typical ly white.  “I lathered up my face and checked to see that my razor was sharp.”  “To lather (lather) up” is another one of those famous two-word phrasal verbs tha t we talk about so much.  It means to put a lot of soap or cream on your skin  and move it around – move your hand against the skin so that there is a foam th at comes up, a foam with little bubbles in it.  The air makes it foam up, we would say.  So, that’s to lather up; that’s what a man will do before he shaves h is face.  I also checked to see that my razor was sharp.  The “razor” (razor) is a sma ll tool that you hold in your hand that has a very sharp piece or pieces of metal a t one end, it’s like a little stick, and you use that to shave the hair off of you r face.  The little sharp pieces of metal that actually cut the hair off of your fa ce are called “razor blades” (blades).  A razor blade that is sharp will cut the hair  off easily.  A razor blade that is dull, that has been used many times, will not cut the hair off easily and might cause you to cut your skin – to actually cut your face so that i t’s bleeding, so that there is blood coming out.  That’s not normally what we  want to happen, so you always want to get a sharp razor blade to put on your ra zor.  “Razor” is the whole thing; “razor blade” is just the thin pieces of metal.  I have disposable razor blades, which means you use them a few times and then you throw them out. There are even disposable razors, where the razor blade i s part of the one-piece razor, and when you’re done with you throw the whole r azor out.  Normally, however, you have a razor and then you have razor blades t hat you put on and take off as they get dull.

“I tried using an electric razor for a while, but I coul d never get a close enough shave.”  An “electric razor,” you probably know, is an electr onic tool that you can use to shave.  Normally you don’t have to put shaving cream on.  Some men like it because it’s convenient; my father always used to shave wit h an electric razor. I actually did try for a while, but I really didn’t like  it.  I could not get a close enough shave; in other words, it always left little piece s of hair and I didn’t like that.  I wanted to be clean-shaven.

“I tried to focus on shaving my neck, my chin, and my cheeks.  I  was in too much of a hurry (I was going too fast), and nicked myself on t he neck.”  “To nick” (nick) here means to accidentally cut your skin with a razor blade causing it to bleed – causing blood to come out of it.  Men sometimes nick thems elves; they have little cuts in their neck or on their face when they shave.  You  have to be careful when you shave, of course.  The verb “nick” has a couple of dif ferent meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some mo re examples.  You can

 also find some additional meanings of the word “shave” i n the wonderful Learning Guide.

Well, I nicked myself on the neck.  “I hate it when that happens!” I say.  That’s a popular expression: “I hate it when that happens,” I ha te when that situation is present, when that thing happens.  Sometimes people say it kind of as a joke, but that’s literally what it means, you don’t like this situat ion.  I say that I knew I was in too much of a hurry, but I was going to be really late.  Well, this time I nicked myself on the “chin,” the end of your jaw line, the par t that is right underneath your mouth.  It’s sort of where the face and the neck co me together, right underneath your mouth and nose.  “Okay,” I said to mysel f, “slow down (go more slowly).  You’d rather be a little late to work than t o end up with (or to have the result of) a face full of potholes.”  A “pothole” (pot hole – one word) is a large hole in a road or a street that is caused by many cars going back and forth.  Here, I’m using it as a joke.  To say that I would have a face full  potholes means that I would have little cuts all over my face, just like holes i n a street.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. > I forgot to set my alarm last night and I woke up later  than usual.  I was tempted to skip my morning shave, but I hate having long stubble a ll day.  I like to be clean-shaven every day.  I’m the kind of guy who gets a fiv e-o’clock shadow early in the afternoon, so if I skipped my morning shave, I’d look like I was growing a beard by the end of the day.

I knew I was in too much of a hurry, but I was going to b e really late.  Oh, I did it again!  This time I nicked myself on the chin.  “Okay,” I said to myself, “slow down.  You’d rather be a little late to work than to  end up with a face full of potholes, right?”

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 646.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can download a Learning Guide there that will help you improve your English even faster than not downl oading the Learning Guide.

This episode is called “War-Related Disabilities.”  “Abil ities” are things that you are able or can do; “disabilities” are things that you ca nnot do.  War-related disabilities are usually injuries, something that happen s to your body that damages it – that hurts it somehow.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Elena:  How do you like your new job at the Veteran’s H ospital?

Wieland:  I like it a lot.  It’s really rewarding.

Elena:  What do you do there, exactly?

Wieland:  My job is to help returning vets who have bee n physically injured adjust to living with their medical disabilities.

Elena:  You mean people who have lost limbs?

Wieland:  Yes, some of the vets have had one or more li mbs amputated.  But that’s only one of the many disabilities we see at the h ospital.  For instance, this week I’m working with a vet who suffered serious hearing  loss and a woman who has developed a visual impairment.

Elena:  It sounds like a very hard job.

Wieland:  It can be, but it’s also inspiring sometimes.  I’ve seen people who are paralyzed – paraplegics and quadriplegics – overcome their disabilities and lead full and happy lives.  With the help of wheelchairs, pro sthetic limbs, seeing-eye

 dogs, and modified cars, a lot of people with disabilit ies can learn to be independent.  That’s part of my job.

Elena:  Then you’re just the person I need to help my b rother.

Wieland:  Is he disabled?

Elena:  Yes, he has a serious case of paralysis, cause by extr eme laziness.  Is there any help for him?

[end of dialogue]

Elena begins our dialogue by asking Wieland, “How do you  like your new job at the Veteran’s Hospital?”  A “veteran” (veteran) is a per son who has been in the military, usually during a war.  A person who is no long er in the military, in the army or navy for example, but they used to be; they were in military service.  My father was a veteran.  He was in the U.S. Army during W orld War II.  A “veteran” can also be a more general term to refer to someone wh o has been through some difficult experience or in an organization that had  problems and this person has a lot of experience.  Or it can just mean someone wh o’s very experienced in what they do.  “She’s a veteran news reporter,” meaning  she has a lot of experience; she’s been doing it for many years.  Here, ho wever, “veteran” means someone was in the military.  The U.S. government has sp ecial hospitals for veterans, especially those who are coming back from war who are injured, who perhaps have lost their legs or one of their arms.  We ca ll these veteran’s hospitals.  There’s one here in Los Angeles; there’s one in almost every big city in the United States, and they are operated by the U. S. government.

Wieland says, “I like it a lot (I like my job).  It’s real ly rewarding.”  Something that is “rewarding” is something that gives you a sense of sati sfaction, that makes you feel this is worthwhile.  Certainly for me, recording t hese podcasts is very rewarding.  Elena says, “What do you do there, exactly?”  What kind of work do you do at the hospital?  Wieland says, “My job is to help  returning vets who have been physically injured adjust to living with their medica l disabilities.”  Lots of terms there; let’s start with “returning vet.”  A “retu rning vet” is a returning veteran; “vet” is short for veteran.  This is a person who is coming back from a war zone, or from a place where they were stationed – where they were working. They’re coming back to the United States; they’re return ing, and hence – therefore we have the term “returning vets.”  “Vet” (ve t) actually has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Lear ning Guide for some more explanations.

 These returning vets have been “physically injured.”  “Physica lly” refers to your body, things that you can feel and see.  “Injured” is the same as hurt or broken. If you injured your foot it hurts; you did something to  it that has damaged it somehow.  “To adjust” means to adapt to something, to  go from one situation to another situation – “to adjust to.”  “Medical” refers t o medicine, things that are used to help you get better.  A “disability” is something  that you cannot do.  Here, it means some typically part of your body that isn’t working  the way it should, or perhaps you’ve lost a leg or you’ve lost a finger; you have  a medical disability. Why do we say “medical disability,” since we are talking ab out the body?  Well, it’s possible to have other disabilities.  In school, someti mes we talk about “learning disabilities,” things that are related to the way you learn, things that you perhaps have difficulty with.  Here, it refers to injur ies – physical injuries to the body.

Wieland says, “My job is to help returning vets who have b een physically injured adjust to living with their medical disabilities.”  Elen a says, “You mean people who have lost limbs?”  A “limb” (limb – the “b” is silen t, we don’t pronounce it) is either an arm or a leg.  You have four limbs: two arm s and two legs.  Wieland says, “Yes, some of the vets (some of the veterans) have had  one or more limbs amputated.”  “To amputate” (amputate) means to remove  either an arm or a leg or possibly a finger or toe.  To physically remove it from your body, we would say to remove it surgically.  You have a special doctor called  a “surgeon,” who is responsible for things like “amputations,” which is the n oun.  So yes, some of the vets have had limbs amputate.  We call someone who has a limb amputated an “amputee,” that’s a person who has had a limb amputate d.  Wieland says, “But that’s only one of the many disabilities we see at the h ospital.  For instance, this week I’m working with a vet who suffered serious hearing  loss and a woman who has developed a visual impairment.”  “Hearing loss” is whe n you are unable to hear very well.  There could be a lot of causes for tha t.  “Visual” refers to your eyes, what you can see.  An “impairment” is something simi lar to a disability; it’s something that you cannot do or cannot do very well.  A “visual impairment” is when you can’t see very well.

Elena says, “It sounds like a very hard job (a very difficul t job).”  Wieland says, “It can be, but it’s also inspiring sometimes.”  “Inspiring” m eans motivating, making you believe that anything is possible, making you want to t ry harder.  Wieland says that he’s seen people who are paralyzed – paraplegics and quadriplegics – overcome their disabilities and lead full and happy lives.   “To be paralyzed” means to be unable to move some part of your body, usua lly because there’s some medical problem.  We also have an expression “to be p aralyzed with fear,” meaning you’re so afraid that you can’t move.  But norm ally, “paralyzed” is a medical condition – a disability.  There are two common types of paralyzed

 conditions.  One of them is to have no ability to use your  legs; from your waist down you can’t move your body.  We call someone who has t hat condition a “paraplegic” (paraplegic).  That’s from the waist down,  the bottom half of your body.  If you can move the top or the bottom half of you r body we would call you a “quadriplegic.”  This is someone paralyzed we would say from the neck down, meaning anything below their neck.  You can move your hea d perhaps, but not anything else.  Unfortunately that happens sometimes whe n people have serious injuries; it could be in war, it could even in a car acci dent.

Wieland says that the patients, the people at the hospit al, often overcome their disabilities.  They are able to go beyond them and lea d, or have, full and happy lives.  “With the help of wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, seeing-eye dogs, and modified cars, a lot of people with disabilities can lea rn to be independent.”  A “wheelchair” (one word) is a special chair that has whee ls on it so that a person who cannot walk can be moved or move him or herself.  “P rosthetic limbs” are man-made or artificial limbs: a leg or an arm for peo ple who have lost their leg or arm.  “Seeing-eye dogs” are specially trained dogs that  help blind people – people who cannot see – in their daily activities.  The y help them walk, move from one place to another.  Finally, a “modified car” is a car that has been changed; we might also say “altered” so that someone who  has a disability can use it.

Elena says, “Then you’re just the person I need to help m y brother.”  Wieland says, “Is he disabled?”  Elena says, “Yes, he has a serious case  of paralysis, cause by extreme laziness.  Is there any help for him?”  Rem ember we talked about being paralyzed with fear.  Well, Elena says that her brother is paralyzed because he’s extremely lazy, he won’t get up and move.  Of  course, she’s making a joke here.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Elena:  How do you like your new job at the Veteran’s H ospital?

Wieland:  I like it a lot.  It’s really rewarding.

Elena:  What do you do there, exactly?

Wieland:  My job is to help returning vets who have bee n physically injured adjust to living with their medical disabilities.

# Using a Smartphone

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 47: Using a Smartphone.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 647.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Lear ning Guide, an 8- to 10- page guide we provide for all of our current episodes t hat gives you the complete transcript of this episode, as well as cultural notes, vocabu lary, definitions, sample sentences – well, just about everything you want in a Learning Guide!

This dialogue is between Hitomi and Jason.  They’re talki ng about using a smartphone.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hitomi:  What are you unboxing?

Jason:  This is my new smartphone.  It has every feature under the sun!

Hitomi:  Every feature?

Jason:  It has a high quality camera and video camera, and  it’s a videophone.  It has a great GPS program, too.  The touch-screen and the keyboard are easy to use and everything is so intuitive.  Even a child could use it.

Hitomi:  Yeah, but a child couldn’t afford the expensi ve price tag, right?

Jason:  True enough, but it has a removable SIM card and  is Bluetooth compatible.  I can even use it as an e-book reader, and download apps for just about anything I want to do.  No child’s toy could do al l of those things.

Hitomi:  Yes, that’s true, but I have just one question.

Jason:  What?

Hitomi:  Can you make a telephone call on it?

Jason:  A telephone call?  You mean a regular phone cal l?  Yes, I think  so.

 [end of dialogue]

Hitomi begins by asking Jason, “What are you unboxing?”  “To unbox” (unbox) is to take something that you bought out of the box that i t came in, to open something that is brand new.  This verb is relatively new,  I think.  It became popular when people started filming the unboxing and  putting the video on YouTube, so you could see what was like to buy a new iPho ne or to buy a new Android phone, whatever the thing that you were buying .

Well, Jason is unboxing his new smartphone.  The term “sm artphone” (one word) is a cell phone – a mobile or cellular phone – that can  also do email, usually has an Internet connection, and often other things as well.   The Android is an example of a smartphone; Blackberry makes a number of smar tphones.  The most popular smartphone, or least the most well known, i s probably the iPhone by Apple.  All of these are smartphones.

Jason says that his smartphone has every feature under the su n.  A “feature” is a characteristic, something special about that product.  Our Learning Guides have several features: vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences.  All of those are things that are special, that are included.  Software, a new car, a television – just about anything can have different features – different characteristics.  This smartphone has every feature under the sun.  To say that it “has every (something) under the sun” means it has many different types of that thing; in this case, it has many different features.

So, Jason thinks his smartphone has every feature under the  sun, all of those that you could possibly want.  Hitomi says, “Every feature?”   Jason says, “It has a high quality camera and video camera.”  A “camera” is a d evice that you use, a machine, that takes pictures – that takes photographs.  Th ere are many different, however, uses of that word “camera.”  Take a look at the  Learning Guide for some more of those.  One use is a “video camera,” this is a  camera that records video, obviously.  Jason says that his smartphone is also a vid eophone.  A “videophone” is a telephone that allows you to see the p erson that you are calling.  That is something that, for example, you can d o, I know, on the iPhone with other people who have iPhones.  That’s a videophon e.  Jason says his phone also has a great GPS program.  “GPS” stands for g lobal positioning system.  It’s a technology that allows you to use typically a sa tellite to know exactly where you are, and you can look at a map and see w here you are.  Many cars nowadays have a GPS system in them that will help you f ind your way to wherever you’re going.  This is especially useful if you ar e in a place that you are not familiar with.  Jason says that the phone has a touch- screen and keyboard

 that are easy to use.  A “touch-screen” is a flat panel o f an electronic device that can tell – that senses when you touch it, and allows you to  do different things. Again, many of the Android phones and the iPhone allo w you to use your finger to move something from one side of the screen to the oth er for example, or to “tap” on the screen, to place your finger quickly once or  twice on the screen in order to perform some action.  A “keyboard” is what you use for typing – what you use for putting letters, numbers, punctuation.  It’s what you use on your computer all the time.  I should also mention that “ touch” can be used in a number of different ways, and those can be found in our  Learning Guide as well.

Jason says that the touch-screen and keyboard are easy to use and everything is so intuitive.  When we say something is “intuitive” (intui tive) we mean it’s very easy for you to understand; you can make sense of it even tho ugh you may not have used it before.  Usually when we say “intuitive,” we mean that it is similar to something else that we do know how to use.  Jason says it is so easy, it is so intuitive to use even a child could use it.  Hitomi says, “ Yeah, but a child couldn’t afford the expensive price tag, right?”  “To afford” me ans to have enough money. The “price tag” (tag) is how much something costs.  Often  when you go into a store, you are looking at for example a new chair or som e other object, you look for the price tag.  You look for the little piece of  paper that says how much it costs.  It can sometimes be used to mean more generally the price.  “So, what’s the price tag on that new car?”  You’re not talking a bout the actual piece of paper – which would probably be called the sticker price, anyway, for a car – you’re talking about what the price is.

Hitomi says that a child would not have enough money – cou ldn’t afford the expensive price tag of the smartphone.  Jason says, “True e nough.”  We use this phrase “true enough” to show that you agree with what another person has said. Often you are agreeing with some sort of perhaps critical  or negative comment, although not always.  Jason says, “True enough, but it ha s a removable SIM card and is Bluetooth compatible.”  A “SIM (SIM) card” is a  subscriber identity module card.  Basically it’s the small card that has your electronic information that you put into a phone to use it.  Many phones have SIM cards yo u can remove and put in a different phone, and sometimes people who tr avel to different countries are getting different SIM cards to use in their phone.   “Bluetooth” is a technology that allows two electronic devices to communicate, to send signals from one to the other.  Bluetooth is a technology that only works for small distances.  For example, I have a Bluetooth mouse and a Bluetooth keyboa rd for my computer. There are no wires that connect the keyboard to the compu ter; it is wireless – without wires – because it is a Bluetooth keyboard.  And we take the keyboard, and we – we use the verb “pair it” with the computer.  Bluetooth devices are paired to each other; they’re connected.  “To be compati ble” means that it can

 use that thing.  So, Bluetooth compatible is a phone t hat can be used with Bluetooth microphones or Bluetooth keyboards, etc.

Jason says, “I can even use (my smartphone) as an e-book reade r, and download apps for just about anything I want to do.”  “E-book” stands for electronic book; an “E-book reader” is a small portable  electronic device that you can use to read text – to read books, magazines, newspapers,  blogs, that sort of thing.  There are lots e-book of readers out there.  T he Kindle by Amazon is a popular one.  Now, the iPad by Apple also has an e-boo k reader on it.  An “app” (app) is an application; it’s a software program that you use, in this case on your smartphone, that allows you to do different things.  Th ere are apps for many, many different functions.  There are ones that you can p lay games on; there are apps that you can use as a map; there are apps that allo w you to translate from one language to another; apps that have the entire di ctionary on them.  So, lots of things you can do with apps.

Jason says, “No child’s toy could do all of those things.”  H itomi says, “Yes, that’s true, but I have just one question.”  Jason says, “What?”   Hitomi says, “Can you make a telephone call on it?”  Jason says, “A telephone ca ll?  You mean a regular phone call?  Yes, I think  so.”  He’s not sure.  Of course, we think of cell phones first as being phones, and second as being these ot her things.  But Jason is so excited about the things that his smartphone can  do he doesn’t even talk about the fact that it is also a regular phone.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hitomi:  What are you unboxing?

Jason:  This is my new smartphone.  It has every feature under the sun!

Hitomi:  Every feature?

Jason:  It has a high quality camera and video camera, and  it’s a videophone.  It has a great GPS program, too.  The touch-screen and the keyboard are easy to use and everything is so intuitive.  Even a child could use it.

# Working on Commission

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 648: Working on Commission.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 648.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  The Learning Guide will help you improve your English even faster – and if you eat it, save money on food!  This episode is called “Working on Commission.”  Dennis and Irene are having a conversation.  Dennis is a salesman; his job is to sell things to other people.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Dennis:  I just got a new sales job and I’m going to be making a bundle.  Irene:  What kind of job is it?    Dennis:  I’ll be working strictly on commission.  The more I sell, the more I earn.  It’s a great opportunity for someone with my talents in sales.  Irene:  I know you’re great at sales and I’m sure you’ll do well, but you can’t coast in a job based on commissions.  You’ll have to work really, really hard.  Dennis:  I’m not worried.  For me, selling is second nature.  I’ll barely have to lift a finger and the profits will come rolling in.  Irene:  But isn’t your paycheck going to be in flux all the time?  You’ll never know what your take-home pay will be.    Dennis:  There’s no cap on how much I can earn, so the sky’s the limit.    Irene:  That’s not exactly what I meant.  Some weeks, it may be hard to live on what you earn, don’t you think?  Dennis:  What?  Do I hear a hint of uncertainty in your voice? # Disliking a Sibling¡¦s Boyfriend or Girlfriend

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 649: Disliking a Sibling’s Boyfriend or Girlfriend.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 649.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website – you know what it is – is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, which will help yo u improve your English – and your love life!

This episode is all about love and hate.  It’s call ed “Disliking (or not liking) a Sibling’s (that is, brother or sister’s) Boyfriend or Girlfriend.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Georgia:  So I thought Carla was nice.

Andy:  You did?  I didn’t get that impression at al l.  I don’t know what Brian sees in her.

Georgia:  Really?  I thought she was really trying to make a good impression.

Andy:  Yeah, she was trying too  hard.  She laughed too loudly at my jokes and complimented you too much on your cooking.

Georgia:  Maybe she was a little too eager, but tha t just shows that she really likes our brother.  What’s wrong with that?

Andy:  Nothing is wrong with that, but did you see how clingy she was?  She wouldn’t leave Brian’s side for a minute, spoke for  him, and finished his sentences.  I just found that really annoying.

Georgia:  Brian didn’t seem to mind and that’s what  really counts.  Maybe he likes having an attentive girlfriend.

Andy:  There’s attentive and there’s smothering.  S he just seemed really possessive, that’s all.

Georgia:  Methinks the gentleman doth protest too m uch.

 Andy:  What do you mean by that?

Georgia:  I think you might like Carla a little too  much for your own good.  Shame on you, being interested in your own brother’s girl friend.

Andy:  Are you crazy?!  Didn’t I just tell you that  I didn’t like her at all?

Georgia:  Yes, but you said it with such passion!

[end of dialogue]

Georgia says to Andy, her brother, “So I thought Ca rla was nice.”  Andy is surprised, he says, “You did?  I didn’t get that im pression at all.”  “To get an impression” means to understand a situation in a pa rticular way, usually different from the way someone else understood the situation.   You and your friend could have a conversation with someone, and then later the two of you talk about that conversation and each of you had a very different v iew about what happened; you didn’t get the same impression.  Andy says, “I don’t know what Brian sees in her.”  When we talk about what someone “sees in” so meone else, we mean what are the things that the one person likes about the other, what are the things that they are attracted to in the other person.  Now, Br ian is the brother of Andy and Georgia, and Brian’s girlfriend is named Carla.  So , Andy doesn’t like Carla; he doesn’t see what Brian sees in her.

Georgia says, “Really?  I thought she was really tr ying to make a good impression.”  “To make a good impression” – that wo rd again, “impression” – means to do or say things that will make another pe rson like you, and will say and think good things about you.  There’s an old ex pression: “You only have one chance to make a first impression.”  That is, there ’s only one opportunity for someone to meet you for the first time, logically, so you always want to present yourself well.

Georgia thought that Carla was trying to make a goo d impression.  Andy says, “Yeah, she was trying too  hard (too much).  She laughed too loudly at my jok es (that is, she laughed more than she should have) an d complimented you too much on your cooking.”  “To compliment” (compliment ) means to say something nice to make someone feel good about some action th at they did.  A husband should always compliment his wife on her beautiful face, on her hair, on her shoes – even if he doesn’t notice that they are new  shoes that she just bought last weekend, and would have no way of knowing that  they were new because he doesn’t normally look at her shoes for example!

 Andy says that Carla is trying too hard.  Georgia s ays, “Maybe she was a little too eager (eager).”  “To be eager” means to be exci ted about something, really looking forward to doing something.  “The students were eager to go to lunch.” They really wanted to eat and get out of the terrib le math class they were in or something.  Well, Georgia says that Carla was a lit tle too eager, “but that just shows that she really likes our brother.  What’s wr ong with that?”  Andy says, “Nothing is wrong with that (that’s okay), but did you see how clingy she was?” “Clingy” (clingy) means that a person depends on so meone else too much; they want to spend all of their time with them.  Sometim es when you get a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend one person wants to s pend more time with the other – calling her day and night, wanting to be with her  all the time – so that you might think the person is being clingy.  They’re trying t o be too close and too dependent on the other person.  “Clingy” has a couple of diff erent meanings in English, and those are found in the Learning Guide.

Andy says, “She (meaning Carla) wouldn’t leave Bria n’s side for a minute.” “Brian’s side” meaning she wouldn’t leave Brian.  S he spoke for him, and she finished his sentences.  “To speak for (someone)” i s to answer questions that someone else is asking that person.  So, someone wi ll ask a question of Brian but Brian doesn’t respond; Carla gives the answer.  That’s to speak for someone. You can also speak for someone in the sense that yo u have the authority to give someone else’s opinion about a topic who isn’t ther e.  But in this case, it’s just Carla answering questions that people are asking Br ian.  She also finishes his sentences.  This is when you are talking and before  you finish your sentence the person you’re talking to, right in the middle, will  interrupt you – will finish the sentence for you.  That can be very annoying!  Andy  says, “I just found that really annoying,” meaning irritating, makes you sort of an gry – a little angry.

Georgia does not agree; she says, “Brian didn’t see m to mind (meaning it didn’t bother him) and that’s what really counts (meaning that’s what’s really important).”  “Count” has a couple of other meaning s in English; you can find those, well, in the Learning Guide.  Georgia says t hat maybe Brian likes to have an attentive girlfriend.  Someone who is “attentive ” pays attention to the other person, tries to do what that other person wants or  needs.

Of course, Andy does not agree.  He says, “There’s attentive and there’s smothering.”  There are a couple of things here.  “ To smother” (smother) means to pay too much attention to someone, so that the p erson doesn’t feel they can be free.  Literally, you can use the verb “to smoth er” to kill someone, usually by putting a piece of clothing in their face so they c an’t breathe, or a pillow.  If you ever read Shakespeare’s Othello , this is what happens to one of the main

characters.  If you haven’t, of course, I won’t tel l you the rest of the story!  Here, “smother” just means that the person doesn’t feel f ree, feels the other person is being too attentive.  Andy says, “There’s attentive  and there’s smothering.”  This construction, “there’s (something) and there’s (som ething else),” is an informal way to show that two things are very different, tha t there is a big contrast between them.  Andy says that Carla just seemed rea lly possessive.”  Someone who is “possessive” wants to have something and no one else can have it, no one else can share it.

Georgia thinks now that there is some other reason why Andy doesn’t like – or says he doesn’t like Carla.  She then uses, speakin g of Shakespeare, a famous line partially from Shakespeare, from the play Haml et : “Methinks the gentleman doth protest too much.”  “Methinks” is an old Engli sh way of saying “I think,” no one says that anymore.  “Doth” is an old form of “d oes.”  “To protest” means to argue against something.  The original expression w as “The lady doth protest too much, methinks,” but the more common usage is to pu t “methinks” first. “Methinks the (in this case) gentlemen (since Andy is a man) doth protest too much.”  Well, what does this mean?  It means that s omeone is denying something.  They’re saying they don’t like somethin g, but in fact they really do like someone or something.  So, that you try to pre tend that you don’t like this person or this thing when the reality is – when in fact you like that person very much but you don’t want anyone else to know about i t.

Andy says, “What do you mean by that?”  Georgia say s, “I think you might like Carla a little too much for your own good.”  The ex pression “too much for your own good” means that you have so much of something that it becomes a bad thing.  If you like candy that’s great, but if you eat two pounds of candy a day, that’s too much for your own good.  In this case, G eorgia thinks that Andy really likes Carla, likes her in a romantic way.  She says , “Shame on you, being interested in your own brother’s girlfriend.”  The expression “shame on you,” or “shame on Andy,” is used to make someone feel bad a bout something they have said or done.  “Shame on you for criticizing your g randmothers cooking.”  You should never do that, shame on you!

Well, Georgia is saying shame on you, Andy, because  she thinks Andy actually likes Carla and would like Carla to be, I guess, hi s girlfriend – assuming he doesn’t have a girlfriend.  Of course, Andy denies this – doesn’t agree with Georgia.  He says, “Are you crazy?!  Didn’t I just tell you that I didn’t like her at all (not even a little bit)?”  Georgia says, “Yes, but you said it with such passion (passion)!”  “Passion” is a strong emotion, a stron g feeling, a strong opinion often about a romantic interest.  So, Georgia is saying y es, you said you don’t like her, but you said it in such a way that makes me think t hat you really do like her.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Georgia:  So I thought Carla was nice.

Andy:  You did?  I didn’t get that impression at al l.  I don’t know what Brian sees in her.

Georgia:  Really?  I thought she was really trying to make a good impression.

Andy:  Yeah, she was trying too  hard.  She laughed too loudly at my jokes and complimented you too much on your cooking.

Georgia:  Maybe she was a little too eager, but tha t just shows that she really likes our brother.  What’s wrong with that?

Andy:  Nothing is wrong with that, but did you see how clingy she was?  She wouldn’t leave Brian’s side for a minute, spoke for  him, and finished his sentences.  I just found that really annoying.

Georgia:  Brian didn’t seem to mind and that’s what  really counts.  Maybe he likes having an attentive girlfriend.

Andy:  There’s attentive and there’s smothering.  S he just seemed really possessive, that’s all.

Georgia:  Methinks the gentleman doth protest too m uch.

Andy:  What do you mean by that?

Georgia:  I think you might like Carla a little too  much for your own good.  Shame on you, being interested in your own brother’s girl friend.

Andy:  Are you crazy?!  Didn’t I just tell you that  I didn’t like her at all?

Georgia:  Yes, but you said it with such passion!

# Buying Television and Movie Programs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 650: Buying TV Programs and Movies.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 650.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English fas ter – and, make you a happier human being!

This episode is a dialogue between Cameron and Jame s.  It’s all about buying TV programs and movies to watch at home.  Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Cameron:  What did you get for Christmas?

James:  I got a box set of my favorite TV show of a ll time, the McQ Files.  It contains all five seasons of the show, deleted scen es, and outtakes.  I can’t wait to watch it all!

Cameron:  Didn’t you see the entire series when it was shown on TV?

James:  I did, but the bonus features make it a mus t-have for a big fan like me.

Cameron:  I just don’t see why people spend good mo ney buying shows they’ve already seen.

James:  Hey, wait a second.  Didn’t you run out and  buy the Podinator trilogy box set when it went on sale last month?

Cameron:  Uh, yeah, but that’s different.  Those ar e movies, not TV shows.  The Podinator box set had the director’s cut and commen tary, not to mention never- before-released scenes.

James:  Hadn’t you seen all three movies when they were shown in the theaters?

Cameron:  Yes, but…

James:  And don’t you own all three movies on video  already?

Cameron:  Well, maybe I do but…

James:  Then I don’t see why you needed to buy the box set.  I think it’s best that you give it to me.

Cameron:  Touché.

[end of dialogue]

Cameron begins by asking James, “What did you get f or Christmas?”  What gifts; what presents did you get for Christmas?  James say s, “I got a box set of my favorite TV show of all time, the McQ Files.”  A “b ox set” is a group of related CDs (compact discs), DVDs, videotapes, books, or so me other material, usually a video or a print material that is sold together.  For example, you might want to see all three of the Godfather  movies from the early 70s: The Godfather , The Godfather II , The Godfather III .  Well, you can buy a box set of those three movies.  They come together in DVD form in a little  box that often contains other information about whatever it is that you’re buying .

James got a box set of his favorite TV show of all time.  The expression “of all time” means the same as ever, throughout the existe nce of something.  If you say, “This is the best book of all time,” you mean there has never been a better book than this one.  James says that the box set co ntains all five seasons of the show, deleted scenes, and outtakes.  The verb “to c ontain” means to have, to include as part of something.  “My book contains a lot of violence.”  It has a lot of violence in it.  “Contain” has a couple of differen t meanings, and those can be found in our Learning Guide.

James says that the box set contains all five seaso ns of the show – of the TV program.  A “season,” when we are talking about a t elevision program, is the group of programs that are shown usually in a perio d of six to eight months.  In the United States, typically most of the new TV sho ws begin in September.  And then, during this summer, they don’t have the show on the air.  That is, you can’t watch it on television or you can only watch old ep isodes, and then they start a new season in the fall, in September the following year.

Well, this show, the McQ Files, has five seasons.  The box set also contains deleted scenes and outtakes.  When you buy a DVD, f or example, of a TV program or a movie often they will include on the D VD things that were not part of the original movie or the original television sh ow.  Something that is “deleted”

is something that is removed.  So, “deleted scenes”  are parts of the story that were taken out for the final version, for what you saw on TV.  But when you buy the box set you get to see some of these scenes – s ome of these parts of the TV show or movie that no one else has seen.  Well, no one else who has not bought the box set!  An “outtake” (outtake – one word) is a small section of a movie that is usually removed because there was a problem with  it, often there’s a mistake. In many box set DVDs you’ll find outtakes from a mo vie that are funny, when the actors or actresses make a mistake.  That’s typical ly what outtakes are.

James says that he can’t wait to watch it all – wat ch all of the programs in this TV series.  Cameron says, “Didn’t you see the entire s eries when it was shown on TV?”  That is, when you could watch it on the regul ar television.  James said, “I did, but the bonus features make it a must-have for  a big fan like me.” Something that is a “bonus” (bonus) is something th at is extra.  A “feature” in this case is just a characteristic of something, some pa rt of something.  So, a “bonus feature” are things that you get extra when you buy  the DVD box set.  A “must- have” is something that you want and feel that you absolutely need to have. James says that getting the box set with the bonus features is a must-have for a “big fan” – that is, someone who likes this TV seri es a lot – like me.

Cameron says, “I just don’t see why people spend go od money buying shows they’ve already seen.”  The expression “to spend go od money” is an informal one that’s used to show your disapproval, how you don’t  like the way someone is choosing to spend their money.  You think it’s on u nimportant or unnecessary things.  Some people might say, “You shouldn’t spen d good money on buying a fancy car.  All you need is something that will tak e you from here to there.”  That would be an example of using this expression “to sp end good money.”  I, for example, will not spend good money on some expensiv e shampoo, since I don’t really need it!

Cameron doesn’t think James should spend good money  on buying television shows – DVDs of shows he’s already seen.  James say s, “Hey, wait a second. Didn’t you run out and buy the Podinator trilogy bo x set when it went on sale last month?”  “Wait a second” means hold on; stop; don’t  go any farther.  James asks Cameron, “Didn’t you run out and buy,” meaning you were very excited and so you went to the store immediately, as soon as it wa s available to buy it.  “Didn’t you run out and buy the Podinator trilogy box set?”   A “trilogy” (trilogy) is a group of three related books or movies typically.  The Lo rd of the Rings  was a trilogy; The Godfather  series was a trilogy, and so forth

Cameron says, “Uh, yeah, but that’s different.  Tho se are movies, not TV shows. The Podinator box set had the director’s cut and co mmentary, not to mention

never-before-released scenes.”  When you buy a movi e on DVD sometimes they will include a special version of the movie called the “director’s cut.”  The “director” is the person who is in charge of the mo vie when it is being filmed. Often, the director takes things out of the movie i n order to be able to sell it to the movie companies – the movie studios.  When they hav e a chance to sell the DVD, then the director will often put in that origi nal cut – that is, that original version of the movie.  Often, movies will have “com mentary.”  That is, there’ll be the director, maybe the producer, possibly the lead  actor talking through the movie, giving you descriptions of what was happenin g or giving you the story behind this particular part of the movie.  And, whe n you buy a DVD with commentary you can turn the commentary on so that y ou can hear them talking literally over the movie.  “Never-before-released” means that it has not been shown to anyone until now.  It’s sort of like delet ed scenes.  “Release” has a couple of different meanings however; take a look a t the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

James says, “Hadn’t you seen all three movies when they were shown in the theaters (in the movie theater)?”  Cameron says, “Y es, but…”  “And don’t you own all three movies on video already?”  That is, C ameron already has copies of this movie, perhaps on an old videocassette tape.  Cameron says, “Well, maybe I do but…”  James continues, “Then I don’t see why yo u needed to buy the box set.  I think it’s best that you give it to me.”  H e’s joking, of course.  James is saying you should give me the box set because you a lready own these three movies.  Cameron, of course, realizes that James is  criticizing her for the same reason that she criticized him.  So the last word o f the dialogue is “Touché.” “Touché” (touché – with an accent over it) is a Fre nch word that in English we use to show that you agree with what another person  has said, and that there’s something somewhat funny about it.  We’re acknowled ging that the other person said something that was true and that perhaps we di dn’t realize until they said it. For example, someone could say to you, “If you are trying to save money, why don’t you stop buying so many expensive books (book s that cost a lot of money) about saving money?”  And, you would say, “Ah, touc hé.”  In other words, you are accepting, in a sense, this criticism – this ob servation about something that is somewhat funny, something that perhaps shows that y ou didn’t think about the situation as completely as you should have.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cameron:  What did you get for Christmas?

James:  I got a box set of my favorite TV show of a ll time, the McQ Files.  It contains all five seasons of the show, deleted scen es, and outtakes.  I can’t wait to watch it all!

# Psychological Disorders

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 651: Psychological Disorders.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 651.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there today and do w hat you need to do.

This episode is called “Psychological Disorders.”  It’s something I’m very familiar with!  It’s a dialogue between Brett and Dr. Mollie  using a lot of vocabulary that you would find in a psychology class – or right her e at the Center for Educational Development!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Brett:  Hi, Dr. Mollie.  Could I speak to you for a  few minutes?

Dr. Mollie:  Certainly.  Have a seat.

Brett:  I’m really enjoying your psychology class a nd I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.

Dr. Mollie:  Sure, go ahead.

Brett:  Well, I have a friend who is nervous all the time, especially around other people.  Could he have a serious problem?

Dr. Mollie:  It’s hard to say without knowing your friend, but he may have an anxiety disorder or some type of phobia.

Brett:  I was afraid of that.  Well, I have another  friend who has mood swings all the time and washes his hands 50 times a day.

Dr. Mollie:  Again, I don’t know your friend so it’ s hard to make a diagnosis, but he may have a bipolar disorder and may also be obse ssive-compulsive.

Brett:  That sounds really serious.  Well, I have a nother friend who doesn’t eat and sits around all day playing with fire.  That’s bad, isn’t it?

Dr. Mollie:  It could be.  Your friend may have an eating disorder and his interest in fire may indicate that he has pyromania, but it’ s very hard to say.

Brett:  Did I mention that he likes to steal things , too?

Dr. Mollie:  People who feel compelled to steal may  have kleptomania.  Who are all of these friends you’re talking about?  Do I kn ow them?

Brett:  No, definitely not.

Dr. Mollie:  Hmm, would your “friends” like to make  an appointment with a therapist?  It sounds like it may be a good idea.

Brett:  No, no.  My “friends” wouldn’t like that.  He has a real fear of doctors.

[end of dialogue]

The title of this episode is “Psychological Disorde rs.”  These are basically illnesses or diseases of the mind.  Brett begins by  saying, “Hi, Dr. Mollie.  Could I speak to you for a few minutes?”  Dr. Mollie says, “Certainly.  Have a seat (please sit down).”  Dr. Mollie is a professor of p sychology.  Brett says, “I’m really enjoying your psychology class.”  “Psychology” stud ies the way the human brain affects our thoughts, our behaviors; it’s a study o f emotions and so forth.

Brett says he’s really enjoying Dr. Mollie’s psycho logy class and he was wondering if he could ask her a few questions; he w ants to ask her a few questions.  Dr. Mollie says, “Sure, go ahead,” mean ing begin.  Brett says, “Well, I have a friend who is nervous all the time, especial ly around other people.  Could he have a serious problem?”  “To be nervous” means to be worried, overly concerned about something, anxious.  Dr. Mollie say s, “It’s hard to say without knowing your friend (meaning it’s difficult for me to determine that), but he may have an anxiety disorder or some kind of phobia.”  “Anxiety” is the noun for anxious; it’s similar to nervous, worried.  A “diso rder” is a general term referring to some illness or sickness.  Here, we’re talking a bout a mental, not physical, health condition: an anxiety disorder.  A “phobia” (phobia) is a very strong fear of something.  If you have “arachnophobia” you are afr aid of spiders.  If you have “agoraphobia” you are afraid of open spaces, big pu blic spaces.  “Agora” is the old Greek word for the marketplace, where people wo uld come and buy and sell things in the middle of town.

Anyway, Dr. Mollie thinks perhaps that Brett’s frie nd has an anxiety disorder or some kind of phobia.  Brett says, “I was afraid of that (that’s what I feared).  Well,

I have another friend who has mood swings all the t ime and washes his hands 50 times a day.”  A “mood” is the way you are feeling;  you can have a good mood, you can be in a bad mood.  “Swing” (swing) here mea ns something that changes quickly, that goes up or down very quickly.  So, “m ood swings” are rapid, unexpected changes in someone’s emotions and feelin gs; one minute they’re laughing, the next minute they’re crying; one minut e you are very happy, and then the next minute you are very sad.  It sounds l ike what you would go through if you were watching the Los Angeles Dodgers baseba ll team last year!  Anyway, mood swings, then, are something that seemed to be affecting another one of Brett’s friends.  By the way, the word “swing” has a couple of different meanings in English, as does the word “disorder.”  Take a lo ok at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of both of those terms .

Brett’s friend also washes his hands 50 times a day .  So, he has mood swings and is always washing his hands.  Dr. Mollie says, “Again, I don’t know your friend so it’s hard to make a diagnosis.”  “To make  a diagnosis” (diagnosis) is when a doctor determines what is wrong with the pat ient – with the person who he or she is examining.  “To diagnose” as a verb me ans to determine what medical problem you have, although we use the word more generally to mean to figure out what’s wrong, what isn’t working.  Your mechanic, the person who fixes your car, may diagnose a problem in your motor – in  your engine.  Doctors diagnose illnesses.  Dr. Mollie says that it’s hard  to make a diagnosis, “but your friend may have a bipolar disorder and may also be obsessive-compulsive.”  “Bi” (bi) usually means two when it’s at the front of a word in English.  “Bipolar” is someone who is extremely happy and suddenly extreme ly depressed.  A “disorder,” remember, is an illness or disease.  So , this friend of Brett’s may have bipolar disorder.  He also may be a graduate studen t; those two things often mean the same thing!  Dr. Mollie says his friend al so may have obsessive- compulsive tendencies.  He may be someone who is “o bsessive,” that’s someone who is always worrying about one particular  thing, who can’t stop worrying about it.  Someone who’s “compulsive” is a lways repeating the same activity, someone who has to do something 20 times or 30 times.  If you saw the movie with Jack Nicholson and… what was her name?  The actress…um…you know…Helen Hunt, that’s it!  The movie was called A s Good as It Gets , from 1997.  Wonderful movie; it is about someone who is obsessive-compulsive, has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Brett says, “That sounds really serious.  Well, I h ave another friend who doesn’t eat and sits around all day playing with fire.  Tha t’s bad, isn’t it?”  Dr. Mollie says, “It could be.  Your friend may have an eating disor der.”  An “eating disorder” is when people either eat too much or they don’t eat e nough.  She continues, “his interest in fire may indicate that he has pyromania .”  “Pyromania” (pyromania)

comes from “pyro” meaning fire and “mania” meaning madness or craziness about something.  In this case, it is someone who i s fascinated by fires and often starts fires, things that can be very dangerous.  D r. Mollie says, “it’s hard to say,” it’s difficult to know what this person’s problem i s.  Brett said, “Did I mention that he likes to steal things, too (that he likes to rob  or steal things from other people)?”  Dr. Mollie says, “People who feel compel led to steal may have kleptomania.”  “To feel compelled to” means that yo u have a strong urge or strong desire to do something, that you have to do something or that you should do something.  “Kleptomania” is a condition where s omeone likes to steal things all time, but it’s a mental health condition, it is n’t just a normal criminal.

Mollie finally says, “Who are all of these friends you’re talking about?  Do I know them?”  Brett says, “No, definitely not.”  Mollie s ays, “Hmm, would your ‘friends’ like to make an appointment with a therapist?  It s ounds like it may be a good idea.”  A “therapist” is a person who provides trea tment and care for someone who has a mental illness or a mental disorder, or s imply someone who is having psychological difficulties.  Actually, the term “th erapist” is also used more generally to mean someone who helps someone recover  from an illness.  We have physical therapists, who help people who have had injuries to their arms or legs for example, to learn how to use them properly  again.

Of course, we think that Brett’s “friends” are real ly descriptions of Brett himself. People often say, “I have a friend,” when they real ly mean themselves.  Brett says, “No, no.  My ‘friends’ wouldn’t like that (th ey would not like to see a therapist).  They have a real fear of doctors.”  “A  real fear of” is a strong fear of, similar to a phobia.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Brett:  Hi, Dr. Mollie.  Could I speak to you for a  few minutes?

Dr. Mollie:  Certainly.  Have a seat.

Brett:  I’m really enjoying your psychology class a nd I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.

Dr. Mollie:  Sure, go ahead.

Brett:  Well, I have a friend who is nervous all the time, especially around other people.  Could he have a serious problem?

# Outdoor Advertising

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 652: Outdoor Advertising.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 652.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Download this episode’s  Learning Guide to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode has a dialogue between Kam and Gina us ing business vocabulary related to advertising.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kam:  Okay, the purpose of our meeting today is to listen to some ideas for our new advertising campaign.  Gina, take it away.

Gina:  Thanks, Kam.  I’m going to talk today about outdoor advertising.  I know that it’s a new area for us and it hasn’t been on o ur radar in the past, but I know it’ll work well for our new campaign.

Kam:  Can we talk specifics?

Gina:  Sure.  There are several types of outdoor ad vertising.  One is the billboard, both the traditional kind and the digita l ones.  Advertising on ones in high-traffic areas will give us a lot of exposure.  To get even more exposure all over town, we can use mobile advertising.

Kam:  You mean advertise on buses?

Gina:  Yes, more and more, products are being adver tised on buses and cars. These wraps can also be put on the side of building s and other structures.  There really are a lot of outdoor advertising options, fr om bench ads to skywriting.

Kam:  That’s all very interesting, but which of the se methods do you recommend?

Gina:  I think we should use all of them – blanket the city with our new ads.

Kam:  All of them?

Gina:  Yes, all of them.  You know what they say: “ Go big or go home.”

[end of dialogue]

Kam begins our dialogue by saying to Gina, “Okay, t he purpose of our meeting today is to listen to some ideas for our new advert ising campaign.”  “To advertise” means to let other people know about wha t you are selling: your product or service.  An “advertising campaign” is a  coordinated effort, a project that includes all the different parts of advertisin g.  There may be advertising on the Internet; it may include advertising on televis ion.  Together, these things are called an “advertising campaign.”  Kam says to Gina , “Gina, take it away.”  The expression “take it away” is used in an informal me eting or an informal situation to show that you are done talking and you are ready  for someone else to begin their presentation or to begin leading the meeting.

Kam is done talking, so he wants Gina to start talk ing.  He says, “Gina, take it away.”  Gina says, “Thanks, Kam.  I’m going to talk  today about outdoor advertising.”  “Outdoor” (outdoor – one word) refer s to what is not inside a building or a house; that is, if you’re not in a bu ilding or in a house, then you are outdoors – you are outside of a house or building.  “Outdoor advertising” would include things that you would see while driving or walking outside of your house or building.  Gina says, “I know that it’s a new ar ea for us (outdoor advertising is a new area for them) and it hasn’t been on our rada r in the past, but I know it’ll work well for our new campaign.”  The expression “t o be on your radar” or “to be on our radar” (radar) is used to show that you are aware of something; you are considering something; you are thinking about somet hing.  “Radar,” as you probably know, is the system used to determine, for  example, where planes are in the sky.  It allows you to know where objects ar e that you cannot see.  Gina says that her company has not used outdoor advertis ing in the past, but she thinks that it will be successful for their new cam paign.

Kam then interrupts Gina and says, “Can we talk spe cifics?”  There’s actually two things here: the first is the expression “can we ta lk (blank).”  In this case, it’s specifics, but you could say, “Can we talk vacation  now?”  “Can we talk advertising?”  This is a somewhat informal abbrevia ted way of saying can we talk about something.  Now, Kam says, “Can we talk speci fics?” meaning can you tell us the specific things about this advertising.  “Sp ecific” is the opposite of “general,” you want to know what is the case for th is particular campaign.

Gina says, “Sure.  There are several types of outdo or advertising.  One is the billboard (billboard).”  A “billboard” is a large s ign used to advertise.  Typically, it’s up high in the air and you can see it when you are driving down the street.  That’s a “billboard.”  Gina says that there are both tradi tional billboards and digital ones. A “traditional billboard” has the same image – you see the same thing every time you go by it.  It’s often made with large pieces of  paper.  A “digital billboard” is a new thing, where it’s actually a big video screen l ike a big television, and the images change as the day goes on.  In fact, they of ten change every 5 or 10 seconds.  We have these digital billboards now here  in Los Angeles, including one just about four or five blocks from where I liv e.  Gina says, “Advertising on ones (meaning on billboards) in high-traffic areas will give us a lot of exposure.” A “high-traffic area” is a place where there are a lot of people or there are a lot of cars going by; many people will see the sign.  Time s Square in New York is a high-traffic area; there are always people there in  the center of the city, in Manhattan.  Well, a high-traffic area would be any area that you had a lot of people either walking or driving by.  If you put ad vertisements, in this case a billboard, in a high-traffic area you will get lots  of exposure.  “Exposure” just means you will be seen or heard by many people, in this case seen.

Gina says, “To get even more exposure all over town  (meaning in every part of the city), we can use mobile advertising.”  Somethi ng that is “mobile” moves around; it doesn’t stay in one place.  Kam asks, “Y ou mean advertising on buses?”  Notice the informal way he asks: “You mean  advertise on buses,” instead of “Do you mean advertise (or advertising) on buses?”  Gina says, “Yes, more and more, products (things that people sell) a re being advertised on buses and cars (obviously on the side of the bus or the b ack of the bus).  These wraps can also be put on the side of buildings and other structures.”  A “wrap” (wrap) is a large piece of plastic or other material that com pletely covers something else. It can be used as a form of advertising for example  on a bus.  Sometimes here in the U.S. when you see a bus there isn’t just one si gn on one side of the bus, but the entire bus is wrapped – is enclosed, if you wil l – by this plastic that is advertising for whatever the company is advertising .  That’s a “wrap.”  You can also put these on the sides of buildings and struct ures.  Sometimes buildings have advertisements that go on the side of the buil ding or around the building. “Structures” is just something that has been built:  a building, a bridge, a monument.  All of these are structures, things that  we build.

Gina says, “There really are a lot of other outdoor  advertising options (or possibilities), from bench ads to skywriting.”  A “ bench (bench) ad” is a bench advertisement; “ad” is short for “advertisement.”  It is when you have a long chair, basically, for people to sit on so you can have two  or three people sitting, and you put these on the street where the bus stops.  S o, when you are waiting for

the bus you can sit down on this thing that, as I s ay, looks like a long chair; we call it a “bench.”  You can put advertising on the benches.  Here in Los Angeles, it’s very common for people who sell and buy houses  – real estate agents we would call them – to advertise on bench ads.  Anoth er kind outdoor advertising is “skywriting.”  The “sky” is what’s above you, up in  the air; it’s usually blue in most places.  Today here in Los Angeles it’s a little gr ay because we have clouds, at least this morning.  Well, “skywriting” when a plan e goes up in the air – a small plane typically – and it writes something in the ai r; it leaves a white vapor or smoke behind it that you can look up and see.  Ofte n people will, for example, write messages to their loved ones.  “Will you marr y me?” for example would be a piece of skywriting – an expensive marriage propo sal, to be sure!

Kam says, “That’s all very interesting, but which o f these methods do you recommend?”  Gina says, “I think we should use all of them (all of the kinds of advertising she has talked about).”  She says, “bla nket the city with our new ads.” “To blanket” (blanket) as a verb means to cover som ething entirely.  She’s saying that we should put advertising in all the different  places in the city: billboards, bench ads, skywriting, mobile advertising, wraps, a nd so forth.  “ Blanket” has a couple of different meanings however; take a look a t our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Kam is a little surprise, he says, “All of them?”  Gina says, “Yes, all of them.  You know what they say: ‘Go big or go home.’”  “To go b ig” means to do something with the most energy, with the maximum amount of ef fort, something that is going to be the most you could do.  If you were going to propose to your girlfriend, and you wanted to go big, you could hire a plane – you could pay to have a message written in the sky – skywriting.  Or, you could…I d on’t know…fly to the moon and send a message from the moon back to your girlfrien d.  That might work; you should try that!  That would definitely be going bi g!  Well, the expression is “go big or go home,” meaning either do something 100 pe rcent or don’t do anything, forget about it.  Gina thinks the company should go  big or not do anything at all. Of course, it isn’t Gina’s money that’s being spent  here; it’s the companies!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kam:  Okay, the purpose of our meeting today is to listen to some ideas for our new advertising campaign.  Gina, take it away.

Gina:  Thanks, Kam.  I’m going to talk today about outdoor advertising.  I know that it’s a new area for us and it hasn’t been on o ur radar in the past, but I know it’ll work well for our new campaign.

Kam:  Can we talk specifics?

Gina:  Sure.  There are several types of outdoor ad vertising.  One is the billboard, both the traditional kind and the digita l ones.  Advertising on ones in high-traffic areas will give us a lot of exposure.  To get even more exposure all over town, we can use mobile advertising.

Kam:  You mean advertise on buses?

Gina:  Yes, more and more, products are being adver tised on buses and cars. These wraps can also be put on the side of building s and other structures.  There really are a lot of outdoor advertising options, fr om bench ads to skywriting.

Kam:  That’s all very interesting, but which of the se methods do you recommend?

Gina:  I think we should use all of them – blanket the city with our new ads.

Kam:  All of them?

Gina:  Yes, all of them.  You know what they say: “ Go big or go home.”

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 653: Reading Product Reviews.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 653.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development here in Los Angeles – beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our dialogue today is between Dominic and Andrea.  It’s going to be about when you are looking to buy something and you decide to see what other people think of that product, what we would call a “product revi ew.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Dominic:  Do you want some help with that box?

Andrea:  Sure, thanks.

Dominic:  What is it?

Andrea:  It’s a new TV.  My old one has been on the  fritz for a week and I needed a new one.

Dominic:  Is this a highly-rated model?

Andrea:  Highly-rated?  I just went to the electron ics store and bought it.  It was on sale.

Dominic:  You mean you didn’t read up on it before you bought it?  You didn’t look at the reviews?

Andrea:  No, I never do that.  I think that’s a was te of time.  I go with my gut.

Dominic:  But if you read the reviews, you’ll know which product gives you the best value, which is the most reliable and durable,  and which company has good customer support.  Nobody wants to buy something th at’s defective or poorly designed.  Don’t you care about those things?

 Andrea:  Maybe, but who has time to do that?  Inste ad, I go to the store and see which one I like overall.  If it’s on sale, that’s all the better.  That’s worked for me so far.

Dominic:  Is that how you bought your old TV?

Andrea:  Yeah.

Dominic:  Enough said.

[end of dialogue]

Dominic asks Andrea, “Do you want some help with th at box?”  Andrea says, “Sure, thanks.”  Dominic asks, “What is it?”  Andre a says, “It’s a new TV (a new television).  My old one has been on the fritz for a week and I needed a new one.”  The expression “to be on the fritz” (fritz) is an informal one meaning it isn’t working very well; it is unreliable; undependable; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.

Dominic says, “Is this (meaning this TV) a highly-r ated model?”  Something that is “highly-rated” (rated) is something that people have a good opinion of, something that is made well.  A “model,” in this ca se, is one particular design of a machine or a product by some company.  For example,  Toyota (car company) has different models: the Corolla, the Camry, and s o forth.  They have different kinds of cars – different looks to their cars.  Tha t’s all part of the particular or specific model.  Dominic asks if this TV is a highl y-rated model.  Andrea says, “Highly-rated?  I just went to the electronics stor e,” places where you would buy a TV or a radio, possibly a computer – these are all electronics.  She says, “I just went to the electronics store and bought it.  It wa s on sale.”  Something that is “on sale” usually means that it has a lower price t han normal; it is discounted, you can buy it for less.

Dominic says, “You mean you didn’t read up on it be fore you bought it?”  “To read up on (something)” – notice the two prepositio ns: “up” and “on” – means to read a lot of information about something, to learn  a lot about something.  “I need to read up on American history for my history test tomorrow.”  Or, “I need to read up on investing money, because I’m getting old and I don’t want to be poor when I’m old.”  The verb “to read” has lots of different  phrasal verbs associated with it; take a look at our Learning Guide for some examples  of those.  Dominic says, “You mean (that is, do you mean) you didn’t read up  on it before you bought it? You didn’t look at the reviews?”  A “review” is som eone’s, usually printed but it

could be spoken, opinion about a particular product ; what they think is good, what they think is bad about it.  You can find thes e in magazines and newspapers; you can find them very easily on the In ternet.  Apparently, Andrea did not read the reviews; in fact, she says, “No, I  never do that (I never read the reviews).  I think that’s a waste of time.”  Someth ing that is a “waste (waste) of time” is something that is not worth spending time on, something that you shouldn’t spend a lot of time on because it isn’t g oing to give you very much. Andrea says, “I go with my gut (gut).”  This expres sion, “to go with your gut,” means to do what you feel is right without doing an y research or asking other people’s opinions, or at least not listening to the m if you do.  Your “gut” is an informal way of describing the stomach, the middle part of your body.  The idea is that you’re not necessarily using your brain – your  intellect, you’re using your feelings and emotions to make a decision.

Dominic tells her, “But if you read the reviews, yo u’ll know which product gives you the best value.”  “Value” means the relationshi p between how much something costs and how good it is.  If you buy a r eally good car at a low price, we would say that you are getting good value.  Domi nic says that the reviews will tell you which product gives you the best value, wh ich is the most reliable and durable, and which company has good customer suppor t.  Something that is “reliable” (reliable) is something you can trust, s omething that is dependable. “Durable” (durable) is something that is strong, so mething that will not break easily.  The opposite of “durable” is “fragile” (fr agile).  Here, Dominic is really using the word to mean that it will last a long tim e, that you can use it for many years and it will still be good.

Dominic also mentions finding a company that has go od “customer support,” we might also say “customer service.”  That is, a comp any where if you have a problem you can call them or email them and they wi ll help you with the problem. Or, if there’s a serious problem they will give you  a refund or allow you to get something else.  That’s good customer support.  Dom inic says, “Nobody wants to buy something that’s defective or poorly designed.”   Something that is “defective” is not working properly, something that has a serio us problem or a flaw, probably because it was made wrong.  The company that made i t did something wrong – it’s defective.  When we say something is “poorly d esigned,” we mean that it is a bad design.  There’s a problem in the way that the pieces go together; there’s a problem in the way that the company decided to make  it, maybe the shape is wrong, or the pieces don’t fit together very well.  That would be something that is poorly designed.  A umbrella that had holes in it w ould be poorly designed.  The purpose of an umbrella is to keep the rain from fal ling on you.  If the umbrella had holes in it, that would be obviously a very poor de sign.

Dominic says, “Don’t you care about those things?”  Andrea says, “Maybe, but who has time to do that (to do all that research)?  Instead, I go to the store and see which one I like overall.”  “Overall” (overall)  means considering everything together, comprehensively, when we consider all the  different parts of something. Andrea says, “If it’s on sale (if the television, i n this case, is on sale), that’s all the better.”  The expression “all the better” means eve n better, something that is an improvement in the situation, that makes it more pl easant or cheaper or more beneficial.  “That’s worked for me so far,” Andrea says, meaning that is how I’ve always done things and I have been successful.

Dominic says, “Is that how you bought your old TV ( the one that doesn’t work anymore)?”  Andrea says, “Yeah.”  Dominic says, “En ough said.”  “Enough said” is an informal phrase that we use when something is  so obvious that you don’t need to add any additional information.  What Domin ic is saying here is that because Andrea doesn’t read the product reviews she  buys things like her old television that don’t work, and this is going to the perhaps a problem with her new television.  He doesn’t need to detail this arg ument; he doesn’t need to explain this anymore, it should be obvious to Andre a what the problem is with her thinking – with her logic.  That’s why he just says , “Enough said.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Dominic:  Do you want some help with that box?

Andrea:  Sure, thanks.

Dominic:  What is it?

Andrea:  It’s a new TV.  My old one has been on the  fritz for a week and I needed a new one.

# Talking About Sound and Volume

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 654: Talking About Sound and Volume.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 654.  I am your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there!

This episode is called “Talking About Sound and Vol ume.”  It’s a dialogue between Delilah and Josh.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Delilah:  Could you turn that down?

Josh:  What?

Delilah:  Could you turn your music down?

Josh:  Oh, sure.  Is there a problem?

Delilah:  No, there’s no problem.  I was just tryin g to do some reading and the ear-splitting music coming from your room made it h ard to concentrate.

Josh:  Sorry.  I didn’t think it was that loud.  I didn’t turn it up, I swear.  The volume control is in the same place it always is, n ot one decibel higher.

Delilah:  That may be true, but those high-pitched squeals coming out of your speakers are really grating.  And what was that ban ging sound?

Josh:  Oh, I was just using this hammer to fix my c hair.  I’m done.

Delilah:  And what was that thumping noise?

Josh:  Thumping noise?  Oh, I was lifting weights a nd dropping them back down on the floor.

Delilah:  I see.  If you could please keep the volu me to a moderate level, I would appreciate it.

 Josh:  No problem.  I’ll be as quiet as a mouse – a s I always am.

[end of dialogue]

Delilah begins our dialogue by asking Josh a questi on; really, she’s making a request.  “Could you turn that down?”  “To turn (so mething) down” or “to turn (something) up” means to decrease, turn it down, or  increase, turn it up.  In this case, really we’re talking about the sound – the “v olume,” how loud something is. You could also turn up the heat if you had, for exa mple, an adjustable heater, but the phrase is most often used when talking about the loudness – the sound on a television, or a computer, or a radio, and so forth .  There are actually several different phrasal verbs that come from “turn,” you can find some of those in our Learning Guide.

Josh says, “What?”  He can’t hear Delilah because h is music or whatever he’s listening to is so loud.  Delilah says again, “Coul d you turn your music down?” Josh says, “Oh, sure.  Is there a problem?”  Delila h says, “No, there’s no problem.  I was just trying to do some reading and the ear-splitting music coming from your room made it hard to concentrate.”  Here,  Delilah is being sarcastic when she says, “No, there’s no problem.”  In fact, she means yes, there’s a big problem.  She was trying to do some reading, but Jo sh had ear-splitting music on in his room.  “Ear-splitting” is something that is so loud it hurts your ears.  It’s something that is so high in pitch, perhaps, that i t is painful to listen to.  Delilah says that she can’t read because she can’t concentr ate.  “To concentrate” means to focus your attention on something without worryi ng about or, we would say, being distracted by other things.

Josh says, “Sorry.  I didn’t think it was that loud  (meaning as loud as you think it is).  I didn’t turn it up, I swear.”  “To swear” (s wear) means to insist that you are telling the truth, to say very strongly I am tellin g you the truth or I will do what I say I will do.  Josh swears that he did not turn it  up; he did not increase the volume.  He says, “The volume control is in the sam e place it always is, not one decibel higher.”  The “volume control” is, you can guess, the thing that you use to turn the sound up or down on radio, a television, a n iPod, and so forth.  Josh says that the volume control is in the same place i t always is, not one decibel higher.  A “decibel” (decibel) is a measurement of how loud something is.  We talk about something being two miles from here; “mi les” is a way of measuring something.  “Decibel” is how we measure how loud so mething is.  It can also be used to measure the strength of a radio signal for example, but the more common use is to talk about loudness.  Decibels are  in what we call a logarithmic scale, for the mathematicians out there.  If you in crease something by three

decibels you’ve made it twice as loud.  Josh says t hat the sound is not one decibel higher than it used to be.  Decibels is alm ost always a comparison between one level versus another.

Delilah says, “That may be true, but those high-pit ched squeals coming out of your speakers are really grating.”  “High-pitched” is a very high sound, like this, like a soprano.  Or someone like me; a man who sing s in a high voice is said to be singing “falsetto.”  The Bee Gees, for example, often sang in falsetto in the 1970s: “How deep is your love, is your love?  How d eep is your love?  I really need to love.”  Pretty bad, huh?  Yeah, they were!  Well, Delilah i s talking about high-pitched squeals.  A “squeal” (squeal) is a lou d, high sound.  Sometimes it can mean that you are very happy or excited.  You c an have squeals of laughter. Or, it could be a very unpleasant sound coming out of a radio or a loud speaker. A “speaker,” speaking of speakers, is the part of t he radio or television or thing you hook up to your computer where the noise comes out.  Delilah says that the high-pitched squeals coming out of Josh’s speakers are really grating (grating). A “grating” sound is an unpleasant one, an irritati ng one, something that bothers you a lot.  It might even make you angry.

Delilah also asks Josh, “what was that banging soun d?”  “To bang” is to make a very loud, often deep sound that lasts for a short period of time.  When you take two things – two glasses, and you hit them against each other, we would say you bang them against each other, you make a banging so und.  I have my cup of tea here – it’s, um, English Breakfast tea today – and a glass of water, and if I bang them together [bang, bang, bang] they make a bangin g sound.

Josh says, “Oh, I was just using this hammer to fix  my chair.  I’m done (I’m finished now).”  A “hammer” (hammer) is a tool that  has typically a wooden handle, something that you grab onto with your hand s, and it has a very heavy piece of metal on the top.  You use it to hit nails ; to push nails into the wall you use a hammer.  Hammer, of course, was also a 1980s singer, M.C. Hammer, but we’re not going to sing any of his songs today!

Delilah says, “And what was that thumping sound?”  A “thumping” (thumping) is a loud sound, but one that you can’t hear very clearl y.  It’s usually something in the distance, but you can tell by the sound that it is a very loud sound and that if you were next to it, it would be very loud in your ears .  Delilah asks what Josh’s thumping sound, or thumping noise was.  Josh says, “Thumping noise?”  You should know, by the way, that “noise” is usually a word we use to talk about sound that we don’t want to hear or unpleasant soun d.  The sound of my neighbors’ children yelling and screaming and squea ling; that’s noise!

Josh says, “Oh, I was lifting weights and dropping them back down on the floor.” “To lift weights” is to try to build your muscles b y lifting very heavy objects. That’s what Josh was doing, and when he put them ba ck down on the ground, what we would call the weights, well, that made thi s thumping sound.

Delilah says, “I see.  If you could please keep the  volume to a moderate level, I would appreciate it.”  A “moderate” level is someth ing not too loud, not necessarily soft, something in the middle.  Not too  big, not too small.  Josh says, “No problem.  I’ll be as quiet as a mouse – as I al ways am.”  The expression “to be as quiet as a mouse” means to be extremely quiet , not to make any noise.  A mouse, of course, is a small, little, typically whi te animal that because it is so small you would never hear it or rarely hear it.  T hat’s not always true, however. Sometimes you actually can hear mice – mice being t he plural of mouse, of course.  We’re not talking about the mouse sitting in front of your computer that controls the cursor on your computer screen, that’s  a different kind of mouse.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Delilah:  Could you turn that down?

Josh:  What?

Delilah:  Could you turn your music down?

Josh:  Oh, sure.  Is there a problem?

Delilah:  No, there’s no problem.  I was just tryin g to do some reading and the ear-splitting music coming from your room made it h ard to concentrate.

Josh:  Sorry.  I didn’t think it was that loud.  I didn’t turn it up, I swear.  The volume control is in the same place it always is, n ot one decibel higher.

Delilah:  That may be true, but those high-pitched squeals coming out of your speakers are really grating.  And what was that ban ging sound?

Josh:  Oh, I was just using this hammer to fix my c hair.  I’m done.

Delilah:  And what was that thumping noise?

Josh:  Thumping noise?  Oh, I was lifting weights a nd dropping them back down on the floor.

Delilah:  I see.  If you could please keep the volu me to a moderate level, I would appreciate it.

Josh:  No problem.  I’ll be as quiet as a mouse – a s I always am.

# Staying in a Vacation Rental

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 655: Staying in a Vacation Rental.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 655.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com – eslpod.com.  Go there t o download a Learning Guide for this episode that will make your life a l ittle happier, a little brighter, a little longer.

This episode is called “Staying in a Vacation Renta l.”  This is when you go on vacation but you don’t say in a hotel, you stay in someone else’s house or apartment.  Of course, you pay them money to do tha t.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

George:  I’m kind of nervous staying in a vacation rental for the first time.

Marnie:  Don’t worry.  Before I booked this unit, I  checked it out thoroughly.  It’s pet-friendly and kid-friendly, and it sleeps six, s o it’ll be perfect for the whole family.

George:  But there won’t be the same amenities or s ervices as a hotel.

Marnie:  We won’t need any of those.  Just think, w e’ll have the run of the place and there are no adjoining units.  The proximity to  town is great and I got a last- minute price that’s even lower than their low seaso n rate.

George:  Everything sounds good, but…

Marnie:  It’ll be our home away from home.  Units t his close to the beach are scarce, and this one is really affordable.

George:  A little too affordable, if you ask me.  Y ou said that it’s just $60 a night?

Marnie:  That’s right.

George:  Are there any taxes or cleaning fees?

Marnie:  I didn’t ask about that.

George:  Do they require a refundable deposit?

Marnie:  I didn’t check that either.

George:  Then maybe it’s too good to be true.  Befo re we get too excited, let’s go read the fine print.

[end of dialogue]

George says to his wife Marnie at the beginning of the dialogue, “I’m kind of nervous,” meaning I’m a little nervous – “I’m kind of nervous,” that’s an informal way of saying a little bit.  He’s kind of nervous s taying in a vacation rental for the first time.  A “vacation rental” is a home, condomi nium, or apartment that you rent; it could also be a room in someone’s house.  You rent it for a short period of time just like a hotel room, although usually you h ave a kitchen and it’s more like a regular house.  Vacation rentals have become very  popular.  People rent out their houses or their apartments to people who are visiting that area.  I’ve stayed in vacation rentals many times, and really find it much better than staying in a hotel, and often even a little cheaper.

Marnie says to George, “Don’t worry.  Before I book ed this unit, I checked it out thoroughly.”  “To book” (book) as a verb means to m ake a reservation, to call or email or write someone and say I want to stay in yo ur hotel or your vacation rental for this day through this day.  “To book” me ans to reserve.  Marnie says, “Before I booked this unit,” meaning this vacation rental – sometimes a unit refers to an apartment or a condominium that is also a vac ation rental, or just a regular rental.  Marnie says she “checked it out,” meaning she investigated it, she checked it out thoroughly.  “It’s pet-friendly and kid-friendly.”  “Pet-friendly” is a place where you can take your dog or your cat, or p erhaps your pig or goat if you have those as pets, and you can bring them with you  on vacation.  If you bring a cow with you, for example, you don’t have to pay for milk, so that’s something to think about!  Pet-friendly, then, is a hotel or a v acation rental where you can bring your favorite pet, like a snake.  “Kid-friendly” is  a place where you can bring another kind of animal, small children, so that is also an advantage if you have small children.  If you don’t, then, it might be a disadvantage if you are staying next door to the place with the small children, but  let’s get back to the dialogue. This place that Marnie found is pet-friendly and ki d-friendly and it “sleeps six,” meaning six people can sleep in this unit; there ar e six beds or beds big enough to fit six people.  She says it’s perfect for the w hole family – for our entire family, for everyone

 George says, “But there won’t be the same amenities  or services as a hotel.”  An “amenity” (amenity) is some characteristic that mak es something more comfortable or more enjoyable.  You may go to a hot el that also has a pool and a spa, that would be a hotel with extra amenities, ni ce things that will make your stay more comfortable.

Marnie says, “We won’t need any of those (any of th ose amenities).  Just think, we’ll have the run of the place and there are no ad joining units.”  “To have the run of the place” is a phrase meaning to be able to  do whatever you want because no one is watching you – no one is observin g you.  In this case, Marnie says they’ll have the vacation rental; they’ll be t he only people there so they’ll have the run of the place and there are no adjoinin g units.  “Adjoining” (adjoining) means next to something; we might also say “adjacen t.”  It usually means, when we’re talking about a condominium or an apartment, that you don’t have anyone who shares a wall; that is, that your wall is the s ame as the wall for the unit next to you.  Marnie says, “The proximity to town is gre at.”  “Proximity” means closeness, nearness.  It’s a short distance from to wn, meaning the main town wherever they’re staying.  She says and she got a l ast-minute price that’s even lower than their low season rate.  The phrase “last -minute” means without any advance notice.  In this case, it means something y ou do right at the very last moment, right before you’re about to do something e lse or right before something else happens.  So, you may call two days before you  are going to leave and ask if you can book the vacation rental; that would be doing things at the last minute. Buying your girlfriend a present for Valentine’s Da y on February 13 th  is also doing things at the last minute so don’t wait gentlemen!

Marnie says they got a rate – a price, even lower t han their low season rate. “Low season” is the time of year when there are few  customers, there aren’t very many people traveling to that area.  Minnesota’s lo w season would be in the wintertime; because it’s so cold no one would want to go there.  The low season for other places will depend upon the weather and o ther things.

George says, “Everything sounds good, but…”  Marnie  interrupts him and says, “It’ll be our home away from home.”  This vacation rental will be our home away from home, meaning it will feel just like home; you  will feel very comfortable there.  She says, “Units this close to the beach ar e scarce, and this one is really affordable.”  Something that is “scarce” (scarce) i s something that is rare, not common, difficult to find.  There are other meaning s of “scarce,” take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations .  We also have some additional explanations of the word “sleep,” which you will find in the guide as well.

 Marnie says this vacation unit – this vacation rent al is very affordable. Something that is “affordable” has a low price; it’ s inexpensive, it doesn’t cost a lot of money.  George says, “A little too affordabl e, if you ask me,” meaning maybe the price is so low because it isn’t very goo d quality.  He’s worried about how good the unit is, and he is, we might say, susp icious; he has doubts about why the price is so low.  He says, “You said that i t’s just $60 a night?”  Marnie says, “That’s right (that’s correct).”  George says , “Are there any taxes or cleaning fees?”  A “cleaning fee” (fee) is money th at you pay in addition to your rent, meaning extra, to have the rental unit cleane d when you are done.  Many people who have vacation rentals will charge you a fee to stay there each night plus a cleaning fee, which might be $25, it might b e $100; you have to ask.

Marnie says she didn’t ask about cleaning fees or t axes.  George then asks, “Do they require a refundable deposit?”  A “deposit,” i n this case, is money that you give to someone in case something goes wrong, in ca se you break something. That way they have some money from you in case you pay for it at least they have your deposit.  If you don’t break anything, th en you get your deposit back when you leave.  A “refundable deposit” means that let’s say I decide to book a unit for June and it is currently February.  Well, I decide that in March I don’t want to go but I have already given them a $500 deposit.   A refundable deposit is one which they say, “Okay, no problem.  You cancelled, we’ll give you your money back.”  Some places may have a nonrefundable deposi t, meaning if you cancel, especially if you cancel, say, a month or two weeks  before the date that you are supposed to arrive you do not get your deposit back .

Marnie didn’t check about a refundable deposit.  Ge orge then says, “Then maybe it’s too good to be true.”  “To be too good to be t rue” means it appears to be very good, but there are some problems with it that are not immediately obvious; there are some disadvantages.  If someone says they will sell you their car for $100 and the car is new, that’s too good to be true; the re’s probably something else wrong here that should make you be a little suspici ous.  George says, “Before we get too excited, let’s go read the fine print.”  “F ine (fine) print” refers to typically the legal language in a contract or agreement; some times it is printed in a very small size – a very small font size.  We call that fine print when it’s printed very small so you can almost not read it – you can barel y read it.  You may see an advertisement in the newspaper that says that you c an buy a new television for $50, but then if you look at the bottom of the adve rtisement in very small print – in very small size lettering – it will say, well, o nly if you also buy a $25,000 car. That would be an example of reading the fine print to get all of the details of this offer or this sale.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

George:  I’m kind of nervous staying in a vacation rental for the first time.

Marnie:  Don’t worry.  Before I booked this unit, I  checked it out thoroughly.  It’s pet-friendly and kid-friendly, and it sleeps six, s o it’ll be perfect for the whole family.

George:  But there won’t be the same amenities or s ervices as a hotel.

Marnie:  We won’t need any of those.  Just think, w e’ll have the run of the place and there are no adjoining units.  The proximity to  town is great and I got a last- minute price that’s even lower than their low seaso n rate.

George:  Everything sounds good, but…

Marnie:  It’ll be our home away from home.  Units t his close to the beach are scarce, and this one is really affordable.

George:  A little too affordable, if you ask me.  Y ou said that it’s just $60 a night?

Marnie:  That’s right.

George:  Are there any taxes or cleaning fees?

Marnie:  I didn’t ask about that.

George:  Do they require a refundable deposit?

Marnie:  I didn’t check that either.

George:  Then maybe it’s too good to be true.  Befo re we get too excited, let’s go read the fine print.

# Ordering Business Stationery

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 656: Ordering Business Stationery.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 656.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide that will help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is about the exciting world of paper –  yes!  Business stationery, the kind of paper that has your name on it or your comp any’s name.  It’s an exciting topic, just wait and see!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jermaine:  How did the investor meeting go?

Teresa:  That meeting has been postponed until next  week.  One of the potential investors is out of town.

Jermaine:  In that case, can you help me with some of this work?

Teresa:  I would, but I’m busy ordering stationery right now.

Jermaine:  Stationery?  You’re ordering stationery?

Teresa:  Yes, of course.  For us to be taken seriou sly as a new company, we have to project a professional image.  Having good stationery is part of that.

Jermaine:  I’m not sure…

Teresa:  Look, we can’t go to business meetings wit hout good business cards, right?

Jermaine:  I guess so…

Teresa:  If we have any correspondence with our pot ential investors, we need letterhead and envelopes, right?

Jermaine:  I suppose…

Teresa:  Okay, so I’m ordering those things.  In the process, I’m ordering some embossed greeting cards and some promotional postca rds.  We’ll also need some notepads and…

Jermaine:  Whoa!  Aren’t you jumping the gun?

Teresa:  Why do you say that?

Jermaine:  First, we need to establish a company, a nd then we can start behaving like one.

Teresa:  That’s where you’re wrong.  If you build i t, they will come.

Jermaine:  You mean if we start behaving like a com pany, then the investors will come?

Teresa:  Precisely!

[end of dialogue]

Jermaine begins our exciting dialogue by asking Ter esa, “How did the investor meeting go?”  An “investor” is someone who usually gives money to a company to help it grow or to start it.  Of course, this pe rson wants to get their money back plus additional money if the company is successful.

Teresa says, “That meeting has been postponed until  next week.”  “To postpone” means to delay, to decide to do something at a late r time.  Teresa says, “One of the potential investors is out of town.”  Jermaine says, “In that case (meaning in that situation or because that is true), can you he lp me with some of this work?” Here we go, Jermaine trying to get someone else to do his job!  Teresa says, “I would, but I’m busy ordering stationery right now.”   “I would” means if I could I would; I would do it under certain conditions, howe ver those conditions are not present because I’m busy.  If I weren’t busy then I  would help you, that’s another way of saying that – with a lot more words!

Jermaine says, “Stationery?  You’re ordering statio nery?”  “Stationery” could be paper, it could be cards, it could be envelopes, al l of which have your organization or your company’s or your personal nam e, address, phone number, other information, nowadays email and perhaps a web site.  Teresa says, “Yes, of course.  For us to be taken seriously as a new comp any, we have to project a

professional image.”  “To be taken seriously” means  to be treated by other people as important, to be considered deserving of respect.  If you want to be treated seriously, you should not go to a job inter view looking like a clown or dressed in a bikini; the employer won’t take you se riously.  However if you are a clown in a bikini, then maybe!  Teresa says that th eir new company, in order to be taken seriously, has to project a professional i mage.  “To project” means to convey.  What does “convey” mean?  It means to pres ent yourself in a particular way so people have a certain opinion about you.  Yo u could say, “She projects confidence,” meaning you get the impression – you g et the idea that she has a lot of confidence.  This word, “project,” can be us ed and pronounced differently; take a look at our Learning Guide for some addition al explanations of that word.

Teresa is projecting an image.  The “image” is the opinion; it’s the way that other people will think of you.  If you want to project a n image of a rich person, you might buy a nice car and wear nice clothing and eat  at a nice restaurant.  That might project the image of a rich person, advice to  those of you looking for a girlfriend – well, a certain kind of girlfriend any way!

Teresa says that having good stationery is part of projecting that professional image.  Jermaine says, “I’m not sure…”  Teresa inte rrupts and says, “Look (meaning pay attention), we can’t go to business me etings without good business cards, right?”  A “business card” is a small card –  a piece of paper that has your name, address, phone number, the name of your compa ny, perhaps a little picture or what we would call “logo,” symbol of you r company on it.  Jermaine agrees and says, “I guess so,” meaning okay, I gues s that’s true; I believe that’s true.  Teresa says, “If we have any correspondence with our potential investors, we need letterhead and envelopes, right?”  “Corresp ondence” is written communication, written messages that are sent and r eceived usually by mail – by paper, but nowadays, of course, more commonly by em ail; it could also be faxed. That’s correspondence: any letters or notes between  two people or two companies.  Teresa says that if they have any corre spondence with potential “investors,” people who might want to give the comp any money, we need letterhead and envelopes.  “Letterhead” (one word) is a piece of paper that has your company’s logo or symbol, the name, usually co ntact information – that is, address, phone number, email, website.  This inform ation is often on the top of the page; sometimes it’s on the left side of the pa ge.  But the page – the piece of paper is mostly blank; you use it to print a letter  out on or, in the old days, to use a typewriter to type on it.  That’s letterhead.  “E nvelopes” are, of course, the things that you put the letter in to mail it, and t he envelope will also have your company’s name on it.

Jermaine says, “I suppose,” meaning he agrees with Teresa that they need these things, but he isn’t agreeing very strongly or very  enthusiastically.  Teresa says, “Okay, so I’m ordering those things.  In the proces s (as she’s doing this or since she is doing this), I’m ordering some embossed gree ting cards and some promotional postcards.  We’ll also need some notepa ds.”  “Embossed” means that the paper, when you feel it, has a what we wou ld call raised surface.  So if you put the paper on a table and you take your fing ers and you go over the name of the company and the logo with your fingers you c an feel it.  That’s embossed (embossed).  She had ordered some embossed greeting  cards.  A “greeting card” is the sort of thing that you would give some one for their birthday, perhaps for an anniversary.  It’s a little card that has a message on the front, and usually you open it up and you sign your name inside of the  card.  Greeting cards can be sent for birthdays, they could also be sent for Chr istmas or a holiday celebration.

Normally companies don’t have a lot of greeting car ds that they use, but Teresa thinks they need them.  She also ordered some promo tional postcards. “Promotional” is anything that is used to get peopl e to find out more about your company, it’s sort of like advertising.  A “postcar d” is a small piece of thick paper that usually has a photograph on one side, and then  you write on the back of the card.  When you go on vacation, when you take a tri p to a new place, you could buy a postcard with a picture of that place and sen d it back home, saying here is what you are missing for not coming with me even th ough I invited you. Something like that!

Teresa also ordered some “notepads” (notepads – one  word), which have many pieces of paper that are attached or connected to e ach other so that you take one and you remove it, and then you have a bunch of  them underneath it.  You have notepads to write on; you may have a small one  or a large one.  They’re usually the size of a regular piece of paper, but a ll the paper is connected – it’s attached so that you can keep it all in one place.  It’s different from a “notebook.” With a notebook, usually the paper is attached or c onnected at the side, on the left side, whereas a notepad usually it’s on the to p.  Also, a notebook usually has wire that goes through small holes in the papers so  that it stays there.  A notepad doesn’t have any wire or holes, it just has typical ly glue that attaches the papers to each other.

Jermaine says, “Whoa (meaning wait a minute, slow d own)!  Aren’t you jumping the gun?”  “To jump the gun” means to do something too early, to do something before it is really necessary.  The expression come s from racing, when you have men or women running in a race – in a competition.  Usually the beginning of the race starts with a gun being shot – not a gun with bullets – and that indicates that

the runners can start to run.  If you start running  before the gun is fired, we say you have jumped the gun; you’ve gone too early.

Teresa says, “Why do you say that (why do you say t hat I have jumped the gun)?”  Jermaine says, “First, we need to establish  a company, and then we can start behaving like one.”  Jermaine is saying we do n’t even have our company started, and you are worrying about things like sta tionery.  Teresa says, “There’s where you’re wrong,” meaning you are wrong about th at thing.  She says, “If you build it, they will come.”  This expression, which originally I think was from the movie Field of Dreams  about baseball with Kevin Costner, means that if y ou build something – if you construct something people will come.  You don’t have to worry that people won’t be interested if you, for e xample, start a company people will come and buy your product.  Of course, this is n’t really true, and many companies think that people will come and buy their  product, and they waste a lot of money on things like stationery before they real ly have any customers.  It’s a very common problem with small businesses.

Jermaine says, “You mean if we start behaving like a company, then the investors will come?” meaning we’ll get people to g ive us money to start and continue our company.  Teresa says, “Precisely!” me aning exactly, correct. When you agree with everything the person has said you would say “precisely.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jermaine:  How did the investor meeting go?

Teresa:  That meeting has been postponed until next  week.  One of the potential investors is out of town.

Jermaine:  In that case, can you help me with some of this work?

Teresa:  I would, but I’m busy ordering stationery right now.

# Checking Accounts and Writing Checks

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 657: Checking Accounts and Writing Checks.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 657.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can download a Lear ning Guide from our website that will help you improve your English.

Today’s episode is about the fascinating world of c heck writing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marianne:  I don’t understand it.  I got a notice f rom the bank that two of my checks bounced.  I’ve never had an overdraft in my life.

Jae:  That doesn’t sound like you.  You’re always s o careful with your money.

Marianne:  I am!  I don’t understand what happened.

Jae:  Let me take a look at your bank statement.  O kay, here are your deposits and withdrawals from last month.  Did you know that  your bank charges you a fee just to have a checking account?

Marianne:  It does?  I didn’t know that.

Jae:  It looks like you also have a minimum balance  requirement.  If you fall below that, you get charged a fee.

Marianne:  I do?

Jae:  If it’s like my checking account, you can avo id that by getting direct deposit for your paycheck.  Did you also know that you get charged every time you use your ATM card to make a purchase?

Marianne:  I didn’t know that!

Jae:  Well, that’s what happened.  Your bank is cha rging you fees for all of those things and after those fees were deducted, you were  left with less money in your account than you thought.

Marianne:  That’s so sneaky!  How could they do tha t?

Jae:  They count on you not reading the terms and c onditions and not looking closely at your statements.

Marianne:  I’ve had it!  I’m moving banks.  I’m tak ing my business elsewhere.

Jae:  Oh, yeah?  I know of a good bank.

Marianne:  You do?

Jae:  Sure, it’s called the Bank of Jae.  No fees –  ever.

Marianne:  Yes, but would I ever see my money again ?

[end of dialogue]

Marianne begins by saying to Jae, “I don’t understa nd it.  I got a notice from the bank that two of my checks bounced.”  A “notice” (n otice) is a notification.  It’s basically an official letter or note telling you th at something is wrong or something about your official account.  You could get a notic e from the library telling you that you have to return your books.  The bank sent Marianne a notice that two of her checks bounced.  “To bounce (bounce) a check” m eans to write a check – that is, to write on a piece of paper saying that t his person can take that piece of paper to your bank and the bank will give him or he r the money – you write one of these checks but there isn’t money in your banki ng account to what we would say “cover the check,” in other words, to pay the c heck.  If you write a check for 3,000 dollars, and your checking account at the ban k has only 100 dollars your check will bounce; it will come back to the person and say sorry, this guy doesn’t have enough money.  Marianne says that she’s never had an overdraft in her life. An “overdraft” is when the bank says okay, we will pay this check even though you don’t have enough money, but now you have to pa y us back plus you have to pay some extra money.

Jae says, “That doesn’t sound like you.  You’re alw ays so careful with your money.”  Marianne says, “I am!  I don’t understand what happened.”  Jae says, “Let me take a look at your bank statement.”  Your “bank statement” is what they send you usually every month that shows all of the money that you have put in

your bank and all that you have taken out.  Jae say s, “Okay (looking at the bank statement now), here are your deposits (money that you put into your bank account) and withdrawals (money that you take out o f your bank account).  Did you know that your bank charges you a fee just to h ave a checking account?” Jae is asking if Marianne realizes or knows that ev ery month the bank charges her a “fee,” in other words, an amount of money.  S o if you have a checking account, the bank will take 5 dollars or 10 dollars  out of your account each month to pay for your account.  Many banks have free chec king; they don’t charge you for a banking account, but some banks do, and when they do we call that a fee.

Marianne says, “It does?  I didn’t know that.”  Jae  says, “It looks like you also have a minimum balance requirement.”  Your “minimum  (meaning the least amount) balance (meaning the amount of money in you r bank account)” is what some banks set up or establish for certain accounts .  If you don’t keep enough money in your bank account, say 1,000 dollars or 50 0 dollars, then the bank will charge you a fee if you go below, or have less than  your minimum balance.  Jae says if you fall or go below that minimum, you get charged a fee.  Marianne says, “I do?”  Obviously, Marianne is not as careful as s he thinks she is.

Jae says, “If it’s like my checking account (if you r checking account is similar to my checking account), you can avoid that fee by get ting direct deposit for your paycheck.”  “Direct deposit” is when the company yo u work for doesn’t give you a check; it sends the money electronically directly t o your bank.  That’s called direct deposit.  If you have a checking account and  the company you work for has direct deposit, many times the bank will not ch arge you a fee.  Your “paycheck” is the money that you normally get for w orking.  In this case however, you don’t get a paycheck; the money goes right to y our bank.  Jae says, “Did you also know that you get charged every time you use y our ATM card to make a purchase?”  Jae is asking Marianne if she realizes that every time she uses her bank card – her plastic card that looks like a cred it card – to buy something she has to pay an extra fee to the bank.  “ATM” stands for automated teller machine. A “teller” is what we call the person who works at the bank who you go up and talk to to deposit or withdraw money.  An “automate d teller machine” is a machine that you put a card into, press some number s, and it either gives you money or allows you to deposit money.

Marianne says, “I didn’t know that!”  Once again, n ot too smart!  Jae says, “Well, that’s what happened.  Your bank is charging you fe es for all of those things and after those fees were deducted (meaning after they took that money out of your account), you were left with less money in your acc ount than you thought.” Because Marianne did not know the bank was charging  her fees she had less money in her banking account than she thought she d id.  Marianne says, “That’s

so sneaky!”  Something that is “sneaky” (sneaky) is  something that is somewhat dishonest or deceptive; we might also say tricky.  They’re not clear about what they’re doing; they’re doing something without tell ing you, that’s the idea.

Marianne says, “How could they do that?”  Jae says,  “They (the bank) count on you not reading the terms and conditions and not lo oking closely at your statements.”  “To count on” means, as a two-word ph rasal verb, to rely on or to depend on, to assume and believe that something wil l happen.  The bank depends on the fact that you are not going to read the terms and conditions.  I should say that the word “count” has many different  meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ones .  “Terms and conditions,” sometimes called in the business world “Ts and Cs,”  are the detailed part of an agreement or contract that specifies – that gives y ou all of the responsibilities, all of your rights, all of things that you have to do a nd that the bank will do.  Any contract has terms and conditions – most contracts,  that is.  The bank has terms and conditions, but most people when they open thei r account don’t read the terms and conditions, which are usually printed in a very small font – a very small size lettering.  Jae says they also count on you no t looking closely, or carefully, at your bank statements.

Marianne says, “I’ve had it!” meaning I am tired, I ’m frustrated, and I’m not going to continue to do this anymore.  “I’ve had it!  I’m  moving banks (I’m going to take my money and put it in a different bank).  I’m taki ng my business elsewhere.” “To take your business elsewhere” means to stop usi ng one company and start using a different company, usually because you are dissatisfied or unhappy with the first company.  Jae says, “Oh, yeah?  I know a good bank.”  Marianne says, “You do?”  Jae says, “Sure, it’s called the Bank of  Jae.”  He’s making a joke here; he’s saying that he can be her bank.  He says, “No fees – ever (you will never have to pay extra fees).”  Marianne says, “Yes, but  would I ever see my money again?”  Once again, following with the joke, she’s  saying that if she gave her money to Jae she would never see her money again.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Marianne:  I don’t understand it.  I got a notice f rom the bank that two of my checks bounced.  I’ve never had an overdraft in my life.

Jae:  That doesn’t sound like you.  You’re always s o careful with your money.

Marianne:  I am!  I don’t understand what happened.

 Jae:  Let me take a look at your bank statement.  O kay, here are your deposits and withdrawals from last month.  Did you know that  your bank charges you a fee just to have a checking account?

Marianne:  It does?  I didn’t know that.

Jae:  It looks like you also have a minimum balance  requirement.  If you fall below that, you get charged a fee.

Marianne:  I do?

Jae:  If it’s like my checking account, you can avo id that by getting direct deposit for your paycheck.  Did you also know that you get charged every time you use your ATM card to make a purchase?

Marianne:  I didn’t know that!

Jae:  Well, that’s what happened.  Your bank is cha rging you fees for all of those things and after those fees were deducted, you were  left with less money in your account than you thought.

Marianne:  That’s so sneaky!  How could they do tha t?

Jae:  They count on you not reading the terms and c onditions and not looking closely at your statements.

Marianne:  I’ve had it!  I’m moving banks.  I’m tak ing my business elsewhere.

Jae:  Oh, yeah?  I know of a good bank.

Marianne:  You do?

Jae:  Sure, it’s called the Bank of Jae.  No fees –  ever.

Marianne:  Yes, but would I ever see my money again ?

# Judging a Contest

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 658: Judging a Contest.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 658.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English – a nd make your teeth just a little bit whiter!

This episode is a dialogue between Omar and Adelia about judging a “contest,” or a competition.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Adelia:  When I created this writing contest, I had  no idea that we would get so many entries.

Omar:  Good thing you have an impartial panel of ju dges to help you select the winner.

Adelia:  Yes, good thing.  I’m really grateful to a ll of you for giving up your time to help.

Omar:  What criteria are we using to score each of the entries?

Adelia:  We’re using a 10-point scale.  Each of us will read an entry and give it a score.  When we’re all done, we’ll average out thos e scores.  Hopefully, there’ll be a clear winner.

Omar:  And if not?

Adelia:  If there isn’t, then we’ll take the top sc orers and vote on which is best. Majority rules.

Omar:  Okay, but are there reasons for disqualifyin g an entry?  For instance, what if somebody didn’t follow the entry guidelines ?

Adelia:  I’ve already culled the entries for the on es that don’t meet the requirements.  These are all eligible.

Omar:  Okay, let’s get started.  We’ve got our work  cut out for us.

Adelia:  You’ve got that right.

[end of dialogue]

Adelia begins by saying to Omar, “When I created th is writing contest, I had no idea that we would get so many entries.”  A “contes t,” as you probably know, is a competition where you have different people trying to become the winner – to get the top place.  This word can be used in a number o f different ways, some of which are found your Learning Guide for this episod e.  An “entry” (entry) is something that you prepare and then give to someone  to be part of a contest; it’s part of the competition.  It can also be called a “ submission,” when you give something – “submit” something to someone.

Adelia says that she had no idea, meaning she didn’ t know; she was surprised that they got so many entries.  This is, of course,  people writing something for this writing contest.  Omar said, “Good thing you h ave an impartial panel of judges to help you select the winner.”  “Good thing ” is short for “it is a good thing (that you have an impartial panel of judges).”  “To  be impartial” (impartial) means to be fair, to be objective, not to favor this pers on over that person.  The opposite of “impartial” is “partial.”  “I am partial to her and not to him.”  You want a “judge,” someone making the decision about who is best, to b e impartial, to be fair.  A “panel of judges” is a group of people who decide h ow good something is, and then decide who is the best person.

Adelia says, “Yes, good thing (meaning yes, it is a  good thing).  I’m really grateful to all of you for giving up your time to help.”  Sh e’s thanking the panel of judges. Omar says, “What criteria are we using to score eac h of the entries?”  “Criteria” is the plural of “criterion” (criterion).  “Criterion”  is a factor; it is one quality or characteristic that you use to judge the quality of  something.  “Criteria” (ending in “ia”) is the plural and it refers to the qualities or characteristics that you use to judge something.  So for example, your professor at  the university might have different criteria for getting an A, a high score i n his or her class.  It might include coming to class every week, writing a paper, doing well on the exam, and so forth.  “Score,” here, is used as a verb, “to score ,” which in this context means to assign a number or letter to something to evaluate the quality of it.  If you watch the Olympics you know that they give scores for the  performances.  In

gymnastics, for example, you could get a 8.5 or a 9 .6.  These are scores; the judges are scoring each of the contestants – each o f the athletes.

Adelia says, “We’re using a 10-point scale.”  A “sc ale” is a range of numbers – of values that can be assigned to evaluate the quality  of something.  So for example, your teacher might judge you on a five-poi nt scale.  Five is excellent; four is, hmm, very good; three is not great; two is  poor; and one is very poor. That would be a scale.  This is a 10-point scale, 1 0 being the highest and 1 being the lowest, or 0.  Adelia says, “Each of us will re ad an entry (read one of the essays, whatever was written), and give it a score.   When we’re all done, we’ll average out each of these scores.”  “To average out ” means to add a group of numbers and then divide by the number of items in t he group.  So, if I give someone an 8 and you give them a 9 and the third ju dge gives them a 10, you can add those up and get 27, you divide that by 3 b ecause there are 3 judges, and that gives you the average score of 9.  That’s how you average out the scores.  You could hear – just say “to average the scores,” but we tend to prepositions and other words to verbs in order to m ake it more difficult for other people to learn English!  “Hopefully,” Adelia says,  “there’ll be a clear winner.”  A “clear” winner is someone who obviously won, it was n’t even close; this person got the highest score and it was much higher than a nyone else.  That would be a clear winner.

Adelia hopes they’ll have a clear winner, but Omar says, “And if not?” meaning if there isn’t a clear winner.  Adelia says, “If there  isn’t, then we’ll take the top scorers (the people who got the highest scores) and  vote on which is best.”  “To vote on” means everyone says who they think should be the winner, and the person with the most votes wins.  Adelia says, “Maj ority rules.”  “Majority rules” means that anyone who gets 50 percent plus 1 wins t he contest.  Omar says, “Okay, but are there reasons for disqualifying an e ntry?”  “To disqualify” is to determine that this person cannot participate in the contest because they perhaps did something wrong; they didn’t follow the  rules.  There’s some reason why they didn’t meet the requirements we might say,  they would be disqualified. If you use certain drugs in…I don’t know…bowling – because you know those bowlers are all taking drugs, right? – then you may  be disqualified if you’re taking, like, steroids or something.  That’s to dis qualify.

Omar says, “For instance, what if somebody didn’t f ollow the entry guidelines?” The “guidelines” are the rules, the instructions.  Adelia says, “I’ve already culled the entries,” meaning I’ve already looked through t hem and got rid of the weak ones or the ones that don’t qualify.  “I’ve already  culled (culled) the entries for the ones that don’t meet the requirements (that are dis qualified).  These (the ones that she has) are all eligible.”  “To be eligible” means that you have met the

minimum requirements; you followed the rules; you a re able to participate in something.  There’s an old expression, “an eligible  bachelor.”  A “bachelor” is an unmarried man.  “To be eligible” means that he is a vailable to be someone you could marry; someone who doesn’t have any other rom antic relationships for example.

Omar says, “Okay, let’s get started.  We’ve got our  work cut out for us.”  This expression, “to have your work cut out for you,” me ans that you have a lot of work; you have many things you have to do, it’s a b ig project.  Some girlfriends try to change their boyfriends, try to change the w ay they look, dress, act, and so forth.  We could say they have their work cut out f or them; that’s a very long job! Adelia says, “You’ve got that right.”  The expressi on here, said with that particular pronunciation – that intonation, “you got that righ t” – is used to show you agree with someone completely.  You fully agree with that  person, and that’s what Adelia is saying to Omar.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Adelia:  When I created this writing contest, I had  no idea that we would get so many entries.

Omar:  Good thing you have an impartial panel of ju dges to help you select the winner.

Adelia:  Yes, good thing.  I’m really grateful to a ll of you for giving up your time to help.

# Finding Love on Valentine¡¦s Day

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 659: Finding Love on Valentine’s Day.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 659.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

You know our website is eslpod.com, but did you tha t know it’s www.eslpod.com, huh?  I bet you didn’t!

This episode is called “Finding Love on Valentine’s  Day.”  It’s a dialogue between Tony and Chelsea about finding love on Valentine’s Day.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tony:  Another Valentine’s Day!  I really hate Vale ntine’s Day.

Chelsea:  What’s your problem?

Tony:  I’m sick of seeing heart-shaped boxes, stuff ed animals, and cupid decorations everywhere.  Lovey-dovey couples on the  street and nothing but sentimental movies on TV – that’s what I have a pro blem with.

Chelsea:  You’re just jaded because you don’t have a valentine on Valentine’s Day.

Tony:  Do you blame me?  This is the third year I’m  spending Valentine’s Day alone.  That’s enough to make any man feel jaded.

Chelsea:  There are plenty of women you could go ou t with.  Just open your eyes and look around.

Tony:  All of the women I know are either psycho or  attached.  I’ve given up on dating.

Chelsea:  How will you find a Miss Right with an at titude like that?

Tony:  I’ve told you.  I’ve given up.

Chelsea:  Well, I think you should open your eyes.  Your valentine may be right under your nose!

[end of dialogue]

Tony is friends with Chelsea, and Tony has a proble m.  He says, “Another Valentine’s Day!”  Valentine’s Day, also known as S aint Valentine’s Day, is traditionally a day that celebrates love and affect ion, especially romantic love. Tony says, “I really hate Valentine’s Day.”  Chelse a says, “What’s your problem?” meaning what’s wrong, why are you so strange.  Depe nding on the intonation, the way you pronounce that phrase, it could be cons idered a criticism.  If somebody says, “What’s your problem man?” they’re i ndicating that you are acting strange or unusual, and perhaps you should b e careful that you could get hurt.  But here, Chelsea is just saying what’s the matter, what is the situation, why do you hate Valentine’s Day.

Tony says, “I’m sick of seeing heart-shaped boxes.”   “To be sick of (something)” means that you are tired of it; you no longer want to, in this case, see heart- shaped boxes, stuffed animals, and cupid decoration s everywhere.  “Heart- shaped” means made in the shape or the form of a he art; of course, that symbolizes love traditionally.  “Stuffed animals” a re small – usually small, they can be big – toys that are in the shape of an anima l, and they’re very soft. They’re often given to young children, however some  men give them to their girlfriends or wives as a romantic gesture.  “Cupid  decorations” refers to the Roman god Cupid, who was the son of Venus and Mars.   In Latin, the word “cupido” means desire, as in sexual, romantic desir e.  That’s what’s the idea behind the cupid decorations.  Traditionally, Cupid  is shown in art as a small boy who has a bow and arrows.  An “arrow” is a long, th in piece of wood that is sharp at one end, and you use the “bow” to shoot the arro ws into the hearts of poor humans, who then fall in love.  There was a great s ong by I think it was Sam Cooke: “Cupid pull back your bow and let your arrow  go straight to my lover’s heart for me.”  It’s better when Sam sings it!

On Valentine’s Day you will often see “decorations, ” things that people put up to make somewhere look different.  For example, at Chr istmas you put up a tree and you may put up lights around your house.  These  would be Christmas decorations.  Tony doesn’t like any of this; he say s he doesn’t like seeing lovey- dovey couples on the street and nothing but sentime ntal movies on TV.  “Lovey- dovey” is sort of an informal way of saying two peo ple who love each other very much and often show that love in public.  They’re k issing each other and they’re holding hands and they’re hugging each other.  You know, the sort of things that girls usually love and guys don’t.  Well, that’s a lovey-dovey couple, and Tony

says he has a problem with that; he doesn’t like th at.  He also doesn’t like sentimental movies.  Something that is “sentimental ” has a lot of emotions, a lot of feelings.  Usually it’s used somewhat as a criti cism; you’re saying it’s too emotional, there’s too much obvious emotion or feel ings expressed in the movie or the song, whatever it happens to be.

You may wonder why Tony hates Valentine’s Day so mu ch, and Chelsea tells us in the next sentence.  She says, “You’re just jaded  because you don’t have a valentine on Valentine’s Day.”  “To be jaded” (jade d) means that you are no longer excited by or interested in something that s eems to interest everyone else. Usually this is because you have had a lot of expos ure – you have a lot of experience with that thing.  This is perhaps not qu ite the case for Tony, even though Chelsea says he’s jaded.  I’m not sure if th at is exactly his situation, but in any case, he certainly is upset or unhappy because he doesn’t have a valentine on Valentine’s Day.  A “valentine” (with a small “v ”) is used as a noun to mean a romantic partner, someone you are involved with: yo ur boyfriend or girlfriend, your husband or wife.  Those would be your valentin es.  Well, you should only really have one valentine, at least one at a time!

Tony says, “Do you blame me?” meaning are you sayin g that it is my fault, do think that I am the one who is responsible for this  situation.  “To blame” (blame) someone is to say that they did something wrong.  W e use this expression to show that we feel that we are rational, logical, th at we are justified in saying the things we are saying.  Tony says, “This is the thir d year I’m spending Valentine’s Day alone.  That’s enough to make any man feel jade d.”  Again, we often use this word when you have too much exposure to a situ ation; Tony seems to have not very much exposure.  But it can sometimes be us ed just to mean bored or uninterested in something.  Tony is unhappy because  he doesn’t have a valentine, and has not had one for three years.

Chelsea says, “There are plenty of women you could go out with.”  “To go out with,” in this case, means to date, to have a roman tic relationship with, to make your boyfriend or girlfriend.  “Just open your eyes  and look around,” she says. Now Tony – you have to understand not too smart, ok ay – doesn’t really understand what Chelsea’s saying to him.  Chelsea s ays, “Just open your eyes and look around.”

Tony says, “All of the women I know are either psyc ho or attached.”  “Psycho” is an informal word meaning crazy, someone with a lot of mental or intellectual problems, someone who doesn’t act rationally.  If y ou are “attached” in this case it means that you have a strong connection with som eone else.  Really, it means that these women already have boyfriends; those are  the only women he knows.

He says, “I’ve given up on dating.”  I should menti on that “attached” has some other meanings as well, and those are in our wonder ful Learning Guide.  So, Tony says he has given up on dating.  “To give up” is a two-word phrasal verb, which means in this case to stop doing something us ually because you have not been very successful; you have failed many times.  “I’m going to give up cooking, because I’m not very good at it.”  True story!

Chelsea says, “How will you find a Miss Right with an attitude like that?”  This is kind of a play on words; that is, Chelsea is sort o f using a traditional expression, “Mr. Right,” and using the feminine – the female “M iss.”  Normally we talk about a woman meeting “Mr. Right,” meaning the perfect husb and, the perfect man to be her husband.  Chelsea says that Tony can meet Miss Right, the perfect woman. Again, that’s not the normal use of it, but she’s s ort of playing with that.  She says, “How will you find a Miss Right with an attit ude like that (with the way that you are acting)?”  Tony says, “I’ve told you.  I’ve  given up.”  Chelsea says, “Well, I think you should open your eyes.  Your valentine may be right under your nose!”  Something that is “right under your nose” m eans that it is easily available. It is, in fact, very close to you, but you don’t se e it, you don’t notice it, and obviously Tony doesn’t realize that Chelsea is not just his friend, Chelsea perhaps wants to be his valentine and Tony is just too much of a man to understand reality.  Isn’t that true ladies?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tony:  Another Valentine’s Day!  I really hate Vale ntine’s Day.

Chelsea:  What’s your problem?

Tony:  I’m sick of seeing heart-shaped boxes, stuff ed animals, and cupid decorations everywhere.  Lovey-dovey couples on the  street and nothing but sentimental movies on TV – that’s what I have a pro blem with.

Chelsea:  You’re just jaded because you don’t have a valentine on Valentine’s Day.

Tony:  Do you blame me?  This is the third year I’m  spending Valentine’s Day alone.  That’s enough to make any man feel jaded.

Chelsea:  There are plenty of women you could go ou t with.  Just open your eyes and look around.

 Tony:  All of the women I know are either psycho or  attached.  I’ve given up on dating.

Chelsea:  How will you find Miss Right with an atti tude like that?

# Work-Related Injuries

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 660: Work-Related Injuries.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 660.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to eslpod.com to download a Learning Guide that goes with this episode that includes a complete transcript of everything we say  – not just the dialogue – as well as vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, and a few comprehension questions.

This episode is called “Work-Related Injuries.”  An  “injury” is when you hurt yourself.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Darrelle:  I just went to a seminar about work-rela ted injuries.  I really have to rethink my workspace.

Kim:  Work-related injuries?  It’s not like we’re d oing heavy lifting every day.  We sit at our desks all day.

Darrelle:  That’s the problem.  Look at how you’re slouching over your keyboard. Poor posture can cause a lot of problems over time.   Aren’t you always complaining about back pain?

Kim:  Yeah, but…

Darrelle:  And look at how you squint at your compu ter monitor all day.  Aren’t you always complaining about headaches?  You’re pro bably suffering from eye strain.

Kim:  It’s true that I sometimes have headaches.

Darrelle:  It’s no wonder.  Look at what we do all day, repetitive motion after repetitive motion.  Aren’t you suffering from elbow  pain right now?

Kim:  I was this morning…

Darrelle:  See what I mean?  We need better ergonom ics in this office.

Kim:  Okay, where do we start?

Darrelle:  I think we need to sign up for a seminar  on how to prevent work-related injuries.

Kim:  What do you have in mind?

Darrelle:  How about this four-day seminar?

Kim:  But that seminar is in Florida.

Darrelle:  What better way to recover from any work -related injuries than spending four days and three nights in Florida?

Kim:  Count me in!

[end of dialogue]

Darrelle (or Darrelle – I guess either pronunciatio n is possible) says that he just went to a seminar about work-related injuries.  A “ seminar” (seminar) is the same as a workshop, or we might call it a conference.  U sually it’s one or two days, sometimes more.  Typically, seminars are meant to t each you something so it’s sort of like a class.  Almost every major professio n has seminars.  I used to give seminars – I used to do seminars for teachers, seve ral years ago, in talking about teaching reading to high school students.  Th at’s one of the things I did before starting ESL Podcast.

A “seminar,” then, is a class where you go to learn  something, and Darrelle learned about work-related injuries.  “Work-related ” means that it was somehow part of your job.  Well, in this case it wasn’t par t of your job; it’s something that happened when you were working or because you were working, something you did at work.  An “injury” is when you hurt yourself  physically, so “work-related injuries” would be things that would happen at work  that cause you pain, that cause you to hurt yourself.  Darrelle says, “I real ly have to rethink my workspace.”  “To rethink,” you should be able to gu ess, means to think again.  In English, that prefix “re” before a word typically m eans to do it again, to do it over and over again.  Darrelle needs to rethink his work space.  “Workspace” (one word) is the area where you work: your desk, your o ffice, and so forth.  This word has become popular in last few years; so has anothe r word called “workflow.”

“Workflow” is the order in which you do things: fir st I do A, then I do B, then I do C.

Darrelle needs to rethink his workspace.  Kim asks,  “Work-related injuries?” She’s confused; she doesn’t understand why Darrelle  is talking about this.  She says, “It’s not like we’re doing heavy lifting ever y day.”  Kim thinks of work-related injuries as being something that would happen if yo u were doing a lot of heavy lifting.  “To lift” something (lift) means to pick it up and raise it up high.  “Heavy” is, of course, the opposite of “light,” something t hat weighs a lot.  So, “heavy lifting” is when you are moving, for example, big b oxes of books or things that are very heavy and difficult that could cause you to, f or example, hurt your back or your legs or arms.  “Heavy lifting,” in general, is  often used to mean difficult work or a lot of work.  You could talk about a computer programmer who does the heavy lifting for a project.  He or she is the pers on that does most of the work. That’s another way of using this expression.

Kim says, “We sit at our desks all day.”  So, they’ re not doing physically difficult work.  Darrelle, however, says that that’s the prob lem.  “Look at how you’re slouching over your keyboard,” he says.  Because th ey sit at their desks all day they also have other injuries.  In Kim’s case, she’ s slouching over her keyboard. “To slouch” (slouch) means to sit or stand in such a way that your back, your shoulders, your neck sort of the curve forward slig htly.  They make you appear shorter than you actually are.  This is something y ou’ll see a lot with teenagers who are growing quickly; they don’t always do what we would refer to as standing up straight.  Sometimes a parent will say to their teenage son, “Stand up straight,” meaning don’t slouch, don’t lean over an d pretend you’re shorter than you are; stand up, put your head up, be as tall as you are.  That’s what the expression means; the opposite would be “to slouch. ”  “Poor posture,” Darrelle says, “can cause a lot of problems over time.”  “Po sture” (posture) is the way you hold your body in general, especially your what we would call “upper body,” from your waist to your head.  “Good posture” would mean  to sit up straight, not to slouch.  Darrelle says to Kim, “Aren’t you always c omplaining about back pain?” “Back,” here, refers to the part of your body in be tween your waist and your shoulders in, of course, the back of your body.  If  you have poor posture, if you are slouching all the time, that might cause some p ain in your back.  “Back” has many different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Kim says, “Yeah,” meaning yes, I do have back pain.   Darrelle says, “And look at how you squint at your computer monitor all day.”  “To squint” (squint) is when you partially close your eyes.  You don’t close the m all the way, but you’re trying to see something better; you’re trying to focus on something.  Or perhaps, there’s

a very strong light and you can’t open your eyes 10 0 percent – completely, so you close them a little bit.  We call that “squinti ng,” especially when you are trying to read something that is difficult to read: it’s t oo far away from you or it’s written in too small of a font – of a print.  Kim squints a t her computer monitor – her computer screen, and because of this she has headac hes.  These headaches, Darrelle thinks, are because she is suffering from eye strain.  “To suffer from” means that you have some pain caused by something.  “I suffer from a sore neck in the afternoons,” it hurts me.  “Eye strain” is w hen your eyes feel tired or they are bothering you, probably because you are trying to maybe read with poor lighting or you are looking at your computer screen  all day.  These things can cause problems with your eyes: eye strain.

Kim says, “It’s true that I sometimes have headache s.”  Darrelle says, “It’s no wonder,” meaning that’s not surprising; that is obv ious.  “It’s no wonder.  Look at what we do all day,” he says, “repetitive motion af ter repetitive motion.” “Repetitive” comes from “repeat,” to do something o ver and over again.  “Motion” is just another word for movement.  So, “repetitive  motion” is doing the same movements, often we associate this with your hands or arms, over and over again.  Darrelle says, “Aren’t you suffering from e lbow pain right now?”  Your “elbow” is what we call a “joint” (joint) that conn ects the two parts of your arm: the part between your shoulder and your elbow and the p art between your elbow and your hand, what we would call the “forearm.”  “Elbo w” has a couple of different meanings, believe it or not.  If you don’t believe me, take you look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Kim said that she was suffering from elbow pain in the morning.  Darrelle says, “See what I mean (which means do you understand now  what I am saying)?  We need better ergonomics in this office.”  “Ergonomic s” is technically the study of how we use our bodies when we are working.  It’s of ten used to talk about the way a chair is designed or the height of your desk versus your chair, doing things so that you don’t hurt yourself at work.  Kim says,  “Okay, where do we start (where do we begin)?”  Darrelle says, “I think we n eed to sign up for (to register for) a seminar on how to prevent work-related injur ies.”  “To prevent” means to stop something before it happens.  “I prevented my wife from yelling at me by bringing home 12 roses, 12 red roses, to show her t hat I love her and that I’m sorry I forgot yesterday was her birthday.”  I’m ki dding, of course.  I would not forget my wife’s birthday.  What kind of husband do  you think I am, huh?!

Well, Kim says to Darrelle, “What do you have in mi nd,” meaning what idea specifically do you have about going to a seminal.  Darrelle says, “How about this four-day seminar?”  Kim says, “But that seminar is in Florida.”  Florida is the state in the southeast corner of the United States.  It i s, especially in the southern part,

a place where people go on vacation because it is w armer than most of the rest of the U.S.  There’s also a Disney World in Florida , though that’s more in central Florida.  Darrelle says, “What better way to recove r from any work-related injuries than spending four days and three nights in Florida ?”  “To recover from” means to get better after being sick or to get stronger a fter an injury – after you hurt yourself.  Darrelle is saying that the best way for  he and Kim to recover from their injuries is to spend four days in Florida.  Kim agr ees with him; she says, “Count me in!”  “Count me in” is a phrase used to show tha t you want to participate in the same thing that someone else is participating in, o r you want to accept someone’s invitation to do something.  Somebody say s, “I’m thinking of going to a concert tonight.  Do you want to go?”  You could say, “Count me in!”  Yes, I’m very interested in going is what you’re saying.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Darrelle:  I just went to a seminar about work-rela ted injuries.  I really have to rethink my workspace.

Kim:  Work-related injuries?  It’s not like we’re d oing heavy lifting every day.  We sit at our desks all day.

Darrelle:  That’s the problem.  Look at how you’re slouching over your keyboard. Poor posture can cause a lot of problems over time.   Aren’t you always complaining about back pain?

Kim:  Yeah, but…

Darrelle:  And look at how you squint at your compu ter monitor all day.  Aren’t you always complaining about headaches?  You’re pro bably suffering from eye strain.

Kim:  It’s true that I sometimes have headaches.

Darrelle:  It’s no wonder.  Look at what we do all day, repetitive motion after repetitive motion.  Aren’t you suffering from elbow  pain right now?

Kim:  I was this morning…

Darrelle:  See what I mean?  We need better ergonom ics in this office.

 Kim:  Okay, where do we start?

Darrelle:  I think we need to sign up for a seminar  on how to prevent work-related injuries.

Kim:  What do you have in mind?

Darrelle:  How about this four-day seminar?

Kim:  But that seminar is in Florida.

Darrelle:  What better way to recover from any work -related injuries than spending four days and three nights in Florida?

Kim:  Count me in!

# Demanding an Apology

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 661: Demanding an Apology.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 661.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, home of Hollywoo d and the Beach Boys – and a lot of crime and smog, but usually sunny and warm , so that’s something.

This episode is called “Demanding an Apology.”  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vera:  That was uncalled for.  You owe me an apolog y!

Alvaro:  Chill out.  It was a joke!

Vera:  It wasn’t funny and it crossed the line.

Alvaro:  Why are you freaking out?  Get over it.  I  was just joking.

Vera:  You really hurt my feelings.

Alvaro:  For God’s sake, I didn’t mean it.  I take it back, okay?

Vera:  You do?

Alvaro:  Yes, I do.

Vera:  And you’re sorry?  You really regret what yo u said?

Alvaro:  I’m sorry you heard my joke.

Vera:  That’s not a real apology.  You owe me a rea l apology.  What you said was cruel.

Alvaro:  I made a joke about you being over the hil l.  You’re clearly not over the hill, so it was clearly a joke.  Okay?

Vera:  Do you really think I’m old?

Alvaro:  No, I don’t.  But you know what you’re doi ng to me right now?  You’re taking years off my life!

[end of dialogue]

Vera and Alvaro are having an argument; they are ha ving a disagreement; they’re not happy with each other.  Vera says, “Tha t was uncalled for.”  We don’t know what Alvaro said, but Vera thinks it was uncal led for.  Something that is “uncalled for” is something that is inappropriate o r unacceptable, something you consider wrong, usually something you consider insu lting.  Vera says, “You owe me an apology!”  “To owe” (owe) someone something m eans that you have to give them something.  You did something, in this ca se wrong, and therefore you must give them an “apology,” a statement saying tha t you are sorry for what you did.  That’s an apology.

Alvaro says, “Chill out.”  “Chill out” is an inform al phrase that’s become popular in the last 20-25 years or so that means to relax, to calm down, don’t be so excited. You have to be careful with this expression; if you  are saying it to someone you don’t know very well it’s often considered somewhat  rude to tell someone to chill out.  However, if you’re good friends with them you  could say it if you thought they were getting too excited about something.  Alv aro says it to his wife, always a bad idea!  He says, “It was a joke!”  Vera says t hat whatever Alvaro said wasn’t funny and it crossed the line.  “To cross the line”  is an expression meaning to go too far.  Often we say this when someone is perhaps  joking but then says something that is insulting that makes the other pe rson angry.  That’s what Alvaro did, according to Vera.

Alvaro said, “Why are you freaking out?”  “To freak  (freak) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become very upset or worrie d about something, to react to something so strongly that you lose control of y ourself: you start yelling perhaps, or doing something else to show that you a re angry or worried.  “To freak out” is an informal expression.  If you are f reaking out, someone might tell you to “chill out.”  Here, Alvaro thinks that Vera is over reacting, she’s getting more angry than she should.  Then he says something  which I recommend very strongly if you are arguing with your wife or girlf riend, he says, “Get over it.”  “Get over it” is an informal phrase meaning that you sho uld stop thinking about something; stop worrying about something that happe ned in the past and just act

as if nothing had happened, just go on with your li fe.  I’m joking, you would not want to say that if you still want to have dinner a nd sleep in your bed; you would not want to say that to your wife!  “Get over it,” is what Alvaro says to Vera; he thinks that she should just forget about his little  joke.  He repeats, “I was just joking.”  Vera, however, says, “You really hurt my feelings.”  “To hurt someone’s feelings” means to make someone feel bad, usually b y saying something that is insulting or offensive, something that would make t hem angry.

Alvaro says, “For God’s sake, I didn’t mean it.”  “ For God’s sake” (sake) is a strong expression used to show that you are very fr ustrated, that you think the other person is being unreasonable.  You have to be  careful with that expression and similar expressions that use the name of God or  Christ or Jesus; many people will find those very strong and offensive ex pressions in and of themselves.  That is, the expression itself may cau se them to get more angry, so probably don’t want to use that expression; I never  do.  But at least now you know what it means if you hear or read it.  In any case, that’s what Alvaro says. He says, “I didn’t mean it,” meaning I wasn’t serio usly trying to insult you.  He says, “I take it back, okay?”  When you say, “I tak e (something) back” you mean that you’re sorry for what you said before and you want the other person to pretend that you never said it; it was a mistake.

Vera says, “You do?”  Alvaro says, “Yes, I do.”  Ve ra says, “And you’re sorry?” You feel bad about what happened and you wish that you had not done it.  She says, “You really regret what you said?”  “To regre t” is similar to “to be sorry,” it means to feel bad about something and wish that it had never happened, typically something that you did or didn’t do.  If you have regrets, you have a feeling that you should have done something that yo u didn’t do.  I think all of us have some regrets!

Vera is asking if Alvaro regrets what he said.  Alv aro says, “I’m sorry you heard my joke.”  He’s not sorry for telling the joke; he’ s sorry that Vera heard him say it. Vera says, “That’s not a real (or true) apology.  Y ou owe me a real apology. What you said was cruel.”  “Cruel” means mean, some thing that you say or do to hurt another person.  Alvaro said, “I made a joke a bout you being over the hill.” The expression “to be over the hill” means that you  are old, that you are in the last half or last part of your life; you are no lon ger young, you are past the best years of your life.  That happens sometime around t he age of – well, any age old than what I am right now!  Now, Alvaro says, “You’r e clearly not over the hill (meaning it’s obvious that you are not old), so it was (obviously or) clearly a joke. Okay?”  He’s explaining why what he said was meant to be a joke, because even though he said that his wife was getting old – that  she was over the hill, in fact – he didn’t really mean it because she is clearly not  over the hill.  This is another

good way of improving your marriage: tell your wife  that she’s over the hill.  You don’t want to listen to my advice on marriage, trus t me!

Vera says, “Do you really think I’m old?”  Alvaro s ays, “No, I don’t.  But you know what you’re doing to me right now?  You’re taking y ears off my life!”  The expression “to take years off your life” means to s horten your life.  More generally, it means to do something that makes you annoyed, frustrated, perhaps frightened, something that may make you die sooner than you otherwise would have.  Vera, by forcing Alvaro into an apology and by arguing with him is, according to Alvaro, taking years off his life.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vera:  That was uncalled for.  You owe me an apolog y!

Alvaro:  Chill out.  It was a joke!

Vera:  It wasn’t funny and it crossed the line.

Alvaro:  Why are you freaking out?  Get over it.  I  was just joking.

Vera:  You really hurt my feelings.

Alvaro:  For God’s sake, I didn’t mean it.  I take it back, okay?

Vera:  You do?

Alvaro:  Yes, I do.

Vera:  And you’re sorry?  You really regret what yo u said?

Alvaro:  I’m sorry you heard my joke.

Vera:  That’s not a real apology.  You owe me a rea l apology.  What you said was cruel.

Alvaro:  I made a joke about you being over the hil l.  You’re clearly not over the hill, so it was clearly a joke.  Okay?

Vera:  Do you really think I’m old?

 Alvaro:  No, I don’t.  But you know what you’re doi ng to me right now?  You’re taking years off my life!

# Doctor-Patient Confidentiality

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 662: Doctor-Patient Confidentiality.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 662.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there today to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English faster than anything – and, if you’re bald, help you grow hair.  It worked for me!  On this episode, we’re going to have a conversation between two doctors who are talking about “confidentiality,” keeping things private or secret between a doctor and his or her patient.  Let’s get started  [start of dialogue]  Dr. Green:  Can I consult you on a case of medical ethics?  Dr. Hause:  Sure, I’m not a lawyer, but I can give you my opinion as another doctor.  Dr. Green:  That’s what I’m looking for, your honest opinion.  I have a patient who has a medical condition that can be spread to her family, but she doesn’t want to tell them about it.  I don’t want to breach doctor-patient confidentiality, but I think that at least her husband should know.  Dr. Hause:  That’s a tricky one.  We both know that the only way we can get our patients to divulge any sensitive information is if they trust us.  We can’t easily put aside that confidentiality.    Dr. Green:  I know, but if she doesn’t tell her family, then they are in danger of developing serious medical problems themselves.  I took the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm.  How can I keep her secret and adhere to the spirit of that oath?  Dr. Hause:  I see what you mean.  If I were you, I’d sit my patient down and tell her what you think her responsibilities are to her family.  Maybe you can convince her to tell them. # Having Problems Concentrating

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 663: Having Problems Concentrating.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 663.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  If you go to our website at eslpod.com you can download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English.  You can also take a look at our ESL Podcast Store, which has some additional courses in English, and our ESL Podcast Blog.  This episode is called “Having Problems Concentrating.”  “To concentrate” means to focus your attention on something.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Vagner:  Aren’t you supposed to be studying for the driver’s test?    Liesl:  I’m supposed to be, but I keep getting distracted.  Reading this manual is deadly.  Vagner:  I know, but if you don’t study, you’ll never pass the test.  Try to focus.  Liesl:  I’ve tried to keep my mind on the rules of the road, but I’m having trouble concentrating.  My mind keeps wandering and I’m almost ready to throw in the towel for today.    Vagner:  No, you can’t do that.  You have to buckle down and learn what’s in this manual.  I’m here to crack the whip.    Liesl:  What’s in it for you?  What do you care if I pass the driver’s test or not?    Vagner:  You can ask me that?  I’ve been chauffeuring you around since I got my driver’s license and I don’t plan on doing it for one second more than I have to.  Liesl:  All right, all right, I’ll study, but not because you’re telling me to.  Vagner:  Oh, yeah?  Then why? # Preparing a Video Resume

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 664: Preparing a Video Resume.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 664.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even faster – and keep your hands from getting dirty!  This episode is about a “resume,” which is a description of your experiences that you give to someone you want to work for when you are looking for a job.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Katrina:  Okay, I’m ready to hear all of your advice about what to put into a video resume.  Raj:  All right.  The first thing to remember is that your video resume doesn’t take the place of your traditional resume; it supplements it.    Katrina:  Okay, I got it.  I was thinking of talking about some of my outside interests and activities to show that I’m a well-rounded person.  Raj:  I’d forget about that, if I were you.  The point of the video resume is to make a good business impression.  It’s not about showing your outside skills or interests.  You’re marketing yourself as a business professional so you should wear business attire, something you would wear to an interview.    Katrina:  Oh, so this outfit is out, I guess.  I wanted to show them my personality.  Raj:  I think that outfit would definitely knock you out of contention for any job.  You have to get it out of your head that you’re going to get hired for your personality or charm.  What counts are your qualifications, your skills, and how you handle yourself in a business setting.    Katrina:  Oh, I was afraid you were going to say that. # Types of Sandwiches

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 665: Types of Sandwiches.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 665.

Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode – and to make your life a little happier today!  This episode I hope will make you happy, or perhaps hungry.  It’s called “Types of Sandwiches.”  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Geraldo:  I am so hungry.  When can we go eat?  Natasha:  Just another minute and I’ll be finished here.  What do you have a craving for?  Geraldo:  I want a good sandwich, maybe a BLT or a pastrami on rye.  Now that I think of it, a Reuben or a club sandwich would really hit the spot.  I wonder if Nathan’s is still open.    Natasha:  I doubt it.  It’s really late.  Geraldo:  In that case, maybe we can find a diner where I can get a French dip or a cheesesteak sandwich.  I’d even settle for a tuna or chicken salad sandwich.  Natasha:  The nearest diner is closed for renovations, remember?    Geraldo:  What are we going to do?  Natasha:  I know of a place that’s open and ready to serve.  Geraldo:  Where?  Natasha:  My place.  Geraldo:  You can make me a good sandwich? # Traveling to Less Popular Sites

This episode is a dialogue between Vanessa and Just in.  It’s a travel episode that will be using vocabulary related to going to p laces that are not very popular for vacations.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Vanessa:  Put away that guidebook.  I want our vaca tion to be exciting and unique, not cookie cutter.  Tourists all visit the same sites.  I want to explore and go to some places off the beaten path.

Justin:  That would be fine except we’ve never trav eled to Podville before and we don’t speak the language.  How are we going to make  our way around if we don’t plan out our trip?

Vanessa:  We’ll be fine.  Stop worrying.  We spend too much time planning. Let’s just fly by the seat of our pants.

Justin:  You really want to just go unprepared?  Th at’s just not sensible. Anything could happen.

Vanessa:  I’m not going to lose sleep over it.  We just need to meet some locals and they’ll be able to tell us about the hidden, se cluded, and offbeat sites.  Those are the ones I want to see.

Justin:  You can explore all you like, but I’m brin ging some insurance.

Vanessa:  What insurance?

Justin:  I’m bringing two guidebooks and this phone  number.

 Vanessa:  Phone number for what?

Justin:  The phone number for the American embassy.   That’s where I plan to go for help when you get lost off the beaten path!

[end of dialogue]

Vanessa begins our dialogue by saying to Justin, “P ut away that guidebook.” “Put away” means stop using it, put it down, put it  back into your bag.  A “guidebook” (one word) is a small book that describ es interesting things to do and places to visit when you are traveling.  So you  might buy a guidebook to Los Angeles; it would have hotels and restaurants, plac es where you can visit.  It’s often very useful to have a book like this when you  are traveling to tell you what you should see and where you should go.  Vanessa sa ys, “I want our vacation to be exciting and unique,” meaning different, unlike anything else, “not,” she says, “cookie cutter.”  “Cookie (cookie) cutter (cutter)”  is when everything is the same, when it isn’t original, when it is a copy of someth ing else.  Literally, a cookie cutter is a small piece of plastic or metal in a ce rtain shape, and when you are small sweets for dessert called “cookies” you often  make them in a certain shape, and to make sure that they all look the same , for example at Christmas time you might have a cookie cutter that looks like  Santa Claus, you use the cookie cutter to make sure all the cookies look exa ctly the same.  But we use it more generally as a term meaning unoriginal, just l ike everything or everyone else.

Vanessa, who’s very hard to please I think – very h ard to make happy, maybe Justin should be looking for someone else at this p oint!  Vanessa says, “Tourists all visit the same sites.”  A “site” (site) is a pl ace or a location that is visited, especially by a “tourist,” someone vacationing in a  certain area.  Notice it’s pronounced the same as “sight” (sight), which refer s to your ability to see. Vanessa says, “I want to explore,” meaning I want t o experience an area not by reading it in a book, but by going out and walking around, discovering on my own what is there.  She says she wants to go to some pl aces off the beaten path. This expression, “to be off the beaten (beaten) pat h (path),” is to go somewhere that is unusual or uncommon, somewhere that is not popular.  A “path” is the same as a trail; it’s a place where you walk.  A “b eaten path” would be one where a lot of people have gone before you.  So if you go  up into, say, the mountains, you may see a path where other people have walked b efore you.  “Unbeaten path” would be a path where people have not gone be fore you and therefore it is not common, not usual.  That’s what Vanessa wants; she wants excitement – just like all women, don’t you think?

 Justin says, “That would be fine (that would be oka y) except we’ve never traveled to Podville before (Podville is not a real place) a nd we don’t speak the language (we don’t speak the language they speak in Podville ).  How are we going to make our way around if we don’t plan out our trip?”   “To make your way around” means to be able to go somewhere that you are not f amiliar with perhaps, but not get lost, to be able to find out where you have to go in an unfamiliar place.  “To plan out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to hav e a plan for what you are going to do; have an idea about where you’re going to go first, what time you’re going to go, and so forth.  You have the details of  what you are going to do. “Plan” has a couple of different meanings, some of them are found in the Learning Guide.

So, Justin thinks they should plan out their trip.  Vanessa says, “We’ll be fine (we’ll be okay).  Stop worrying.  We spend too much  time planning (too much time thinking about what we want to do).  Let’s jus t fly by the seat of our pants.” “Let’s just” means why don’t we or I want to have u s do this.  What she wants them to do is to fly by the seat of their pants (pa nts).  Well, your “pants” are things that you wear that go on your legs, and the “seat of your pants” would be where you sit down, that part of your pants – your behind, your rear, what we might informally call your “butt” (butt).  However,  the expression “to fly by the seat of your pants” means to do things without planning,  to do things spontaneously. That is, you don’t worry about it, you just go and you do something because you feel like doing it; there’s no planning involved.  You’re not, of course, actually flying up in an airplane; it’s just an expression, to do something without planning it.

Justin says, “You really want to just go unprepared ?  That’s just not sensible.” Something that is “sensible” is something that is r easonable, something that makes sense, that is logical.  Justin says, “Anythi ng could happen.”  Vanessa says, “I’m not going to lose sleep over it.”  “To l ose sleep over (something)” means to spend a lot of time worrying about it, bei ng very anxious about it. You’re so anxious, you’re so worried, you can’t eve n sleep because you keep thinking about it.  But Vanessa is not going to los e sleep over this thing or about this thing.  She says, “We just need to meet some l ocals and they’ll be able to tell us about the hidden, secluded, and offbeat sites.”  “Locals” (locals) are people who live permanently in a certain area.  If you com e to Los Angeles, I would be a local; I am someone who lives here.  You would be a  tourist or a vacationer; a traveler, we might say.

Vanessa wants to meet some locals so she can ask th em about hidden, secluded, offbeat sites.  Something that is “hidden ” is something that you cannot

see.  More generally, it’s something that is secret ; not a lot of people know about it.  “Secluded” (secluded) is very private and quie t, away from other people, a place that is not close to anyone else.  “Offbeat” (one word) means somewhat unusual, something that is interesting but not the normal kind of thing you might go see.  So that’s what Vanessa wants, the hidden, secluded, and offbeat sites. “Those are the ones I want to see.”

Justin says, “You can explore all you like (all you  want), but I’m bringing some insurance.”  “Insurance” is normally something you buy from a company in case you have an accident or something goes wrong.  You can have health insurance; if you get sick the insurance will pay for your med ical care.  Here, “insurance” is used more generally to mean something that will pro tect you from problems, something that will give you a guarantee in case so mething goes wrong that things will be okay.  Vanessa asks, “What insurance ?”  Justin says, “I’m bringing two guidebooks and this phone number.”  Vanessa say s, “Phone number for what (which phone number)?”  Justin says, “The phon e number for the American embassy.”  An “embassy” (embassy) is the official p resence of another country in your country.  Usually the embassies are located in  the capital of the country, so in Washington, D.C. there is a Russian embassy.  Th at’s the building where the Russian representatives – the “diplomats,” we would  call them – are working and perhaps some of them living.  Embassies are usually  considered, in some ways, property of the other country and are protected by international law.  The U.S. embassy, or American embassy, would be the American  place in a country where the American diplomats and representatives ar e.  Justin says, “That’s where I plan to go for help when you get lost off t he beaten path!”  “To get lost” means to become confused and not know where you are , usually because you are somewhere that you are not used to – that you a re not familiar with.  Justin says he’s going to call the American embassy when V anessa gets lost off the beaten path, going somewhere that is not popular.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Vanessa:  Put away that guidebook.  I want our vaca tion to be exciting and unique, not cookie cutter.  Tourists all visit the same sites.  I want to explore and go to some places off the beaten path.

Justin:  That would be fine except we’ve never trav eled to Podville before and we don’t speak the language.  How are we going to make  our way around if we don’t plan out our trip?

Vanessa:  We’ll be fine.  Stop worrying.  We spend too much time planning. Let’s just fly by the seat of our pants.

Justin:  You really want to just go unprepared?  Th at’s just not sensible. Anything could happen.

Vanessa:  I’m not going to lose sleep over it.  We just need to meet some locals and they’ll be able to tell us about the hidden, se cluded, and offbeat sites.  Those are the ones I want to see.

Justin:  You can explore all you like, but I’m brin ging some insurance.

Vanessa:  What insurance?

Justin:  I’m bringing two guidebooks and this phone  number.

Vanessa:  Phone number for what?

Justin:  The phone number for the American embassy.   That’s where I plan to go for help when you get lost off the beaten path!

# Trying to Remember

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 667: Trying to Remember.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 667.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, where the sun is  shining and there are no clouds in the sky.

This episode is a dialogue between Randal and Marjo rie.  It’s about trying to remember something, phrases related to when you for get something, something that happens to…um…well…let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Randal:  Hurry up.  Rob will be here any minute.

Marjorie:  I can’t remember the combination to this  lock.

Randal:  I thought you knew it by heart.

Marjorie:  It’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’ t seem to remember the last two digits.  It’s 73 or 63 or 38…

Randal:  You said you had it down cold!

Marjorie:  I do know it, but it’s just slipped my m ind.  I’ll figure it out.  I used a mnemonic to remember those last two digits.  I just  need to jog my memory.  The last digits have to do with my birthday, or is it R ob’s birthday…

Randal:  I only let you in on this little joke we’r e going to play on Rob because you said you knew the combination to the lock on hi s bike.  I should have known you were lying through your teeth.

Marjorie:  I wasn’t lying.  I really do know it.  I f you’ll just stop talking so I can concentrate…

Randal:  Too late.  Here comes Rob.  Run for your l ife, if you know what’s good for you!

[end of dialogue]

Randal says to Marjorie, “Hurry up.”  “Hurry up” is  a two-word phrasal verb meaning to do something more quickly than what you are doing now, to rush, to do it faster.  Randal is telling Marjorie to hurry up, meaning finish what she is doing faster, because Rob will be here any minute –  Rob will be here soon.

Marjorie says, “I can’t remember the combination to  this lock.”  A “lock” is a device, something you use to make sure no one opens  or goes in a certain place. You can have a lock on your door so that no one can  open your door without having a key.  You can also have a lock on a bicycl e, and often those locks don’t have keys.  They have instead what’s called a “comb ination.”  The “combination” is the series of numbers that you need to know, and  you turn a little wheel back and forth to these numbers, and when you go to the right numbers – the right combination – then the lock will open.  “Combinatio n” has some other meanings as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for some  additional explanations.

Randal says, “I thought you knew it by heart.”  “To  know (something) by heart” means to have something memorized, to be able to sa y it without reading it.  We often know our passwords by heart, or at least some  of them.  You may know the names of all of your cousins by heart.  I sure don’ t; I have too many.  I barely know the names of my brothers and sisters.  I do kn ow my wife’s name – usually!

Well, Randal says to Marjorie, “I thought you knew (this combination to the lock) by heart.”  Marjorie says, “It’s on the tip of my t ongue.”  The “tip” is the end part of something in this case.  But the expression “to be on the tip of your tongue” means that you normally remember but you have tempo rarily forgotten it.  You think you will be able to remember it soon, but you  can’t think of it at this very moment – right now.  Marjorie says, “I can’t seem t o remember the last two digits,” which in this case means numbers.  She say s, “It’s 73 or 63 or 38…” Randal then says, “I thought you had it down cold!”   “To have (something) down cold” is the same as knowing it by heart; it means to memorize it, you memorize it so well you will never forget it

Marjorie says, “I do know it, but it’s just slipped  my mind.”  When we say something “slips (slips) your mind” we mean you nor mally remember it but you are not able to remember it right now.  It’s simila r to “being on the tip of your tongue.”  However, we often use “it slipped my mind ” when we are talking about things that we forgot, such as an appointment.  “I was supposed to got to the

doctor today, but I got very busy at my work and it  slipped my mind.”  I forgot it; I did not remember it.  Marjorie says, “I’ll figure i t out (I’ll somehow remember and solve this problem).”  She says, “I used a mnemonic  to remember those last two digits.”  A “mnemonic” (mnemonic – notice the first  letter, “m”, is silent; you do not pronounce it) is a mental trick, I guess we could s ay, to remember something, often something that is sort of silly or unusual.  Or, it could be a song or an expression that somehow helps you remember somethin g else.  That’s what Marjorie says she used to remember the last two dig its, or two numbers, of the combination to the lock.  She says, “I just need to  jog (jog) my memory.”  “To jog your memory” means to do something that helps you r emember something. Sometimes, for example, I go into the kitchen from the living room of my house wanting to get something and I forget what it is I was going to get.  So I go back into the living room, where I had originally though t of it, and sometimes just being in that same place jogs my memory.  Or you may have  other things that jog your memory.  You may be listening to the radio and they  have an announcement about healthcare, and you think, “Oh, yeah.  I have  to pay my health insurance this month.”  That story on the radio jogged your m emory.  Marjorie says, “The last digits have to do with my birthday, or is it R ob’s birthday…”  “To have to do with (something)” means to be related to or connect ed to something.  You might say, “This book has to do with the American Revolut ion,” that’s what it is about, that is what it is connected or related to.  In thi s case, the numbers are somehow related to Marjorie’s birthday; but she isn’t sure,  maybe it was Rob’s birthday.

Randal then says, “I only let you in on this little  joke we’re going to play on Rob because you said you knew the combination to the lo ck on his bike.”  “To let (someone) in on (something)” is an expression that means to let someone know about something secret.  In fact, sometimes we use the phrase “I’m going to let you in on a little secret,” I’m going to tell you s omething that no one else knows. Randal says that he only let Marjorie in on this jo ke that they are going to “play on” Rob, meaning they are going to do to Rob, “beca use you said you knew the combination to lock on his bike.”  So they’re going  to play some trick, we might call it a “prank” (prank), on Rob, do something tha t they think will be funny. Randal says, “I should have known you were lying th rough your teeth.”  “To lie through your teeth” means to say something with a l ot of confidence that you know is not true.  It’s something that is very bold , we might say, something that is perhaps a very big lie but you say it confidently.  In other words, Randal thinks Marjorie was lying – was not telling him the truth – when she told him that she knew the combination to Rob’s bike lock.

Marjorie says, “I wasn’t lying.  I really do know i t.  If you just stop talking so I can concentrate…”  “To concentrate” means to focus, to think very clearly about something and not be distracted, not think about ot her things that you shouldn’t

be worrying about right now.  Randal says, “Too lat e (meaning it’s too late).  Here comes Rob.”  So Rob is now arriving to wherever Ran dal and Marjorie are. Randal says, “Run for your life, if you know what’s  good for you!”  “To run for your life” means to run as quickly as you can, as f ast as you can.  The idea is if you don’t you might be killed; you might lose your life.  Normally it’s not that serious.  We use this expression to mean to run ver y quickly, to get away from somewhere as fast as you can.  Randal says to Marjo rie, “Run for your life, if you know what’s good for you!”  That phrase is used to show that your advice – what you are telling them or recommending to them – is s omething that will help them, they will benefit from your advice.  “If you know w hat’s good for you,” you’re saying what I am telling you will help you, it will  be a good thing for you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Randal:  Hurry up.  Rob will be here any minute.

Marjorie:  I can’t remember the combination to this  lock.

Randal:  I thought you knew it by heart.

Marjorie:  It’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’ t seem to remember the last two digits.  It’s 73 or 63 or 38…

Randal:  You said you had it down cold!

Marjorie:  I do know it, but it’s just slipped my m ind.  I’ll figure it out.  I used a mnemonic to remember those last two digits.  I just  need to jog my memory.  The last digits have to do with my birthday, or is it R ob’s birthday…

# Having Cash Flow Problems

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 668: Having Cash Flow Problems.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 668.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful – a little rainy, but otherwise beautiful Los Angeles, California.  This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learning Guide.  Go to our website at eslpod.com and download it.  You’ll improve your English much faster by having a transcript, vocabulary, and additional cultural and vocabulary information included in the Guide.  This episode is about business.  It’s about something called “cash flow.”  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Kylie:  I’ve just crunched the numbers and we’re not going to be able to meet payroll next month because of cash flow problems.    Miguel:  That can’t be.  The cash flow projections from last month showed that we’d be fine.  Kylie:  We didn’t anticipate a shortfall in income this month and didn’t set aside enough cash to hedge against a cash flow problem.  Miguel:  What can we do?  We need a stopgap solution now.    Kylie:  Well, we could try to extend our line of credit at the bank.    Miguel:  We’re already overextended at the bank.  I don’t want to push our luck.  Kylie:  The other option is to hold off on paying our suppliers and hope that our income goes up next month, as predicted.  Miguel:  Do you really think we can hold them off for that long?    Kylie:  I’ll have a talk with our biggest suppliers and give them assurances that they’ll get paid.  Let’s just hope they’re not having cash flow problems of their own! # Making Controversial Comments

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 669: Making Controversial Comments.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 669.

You can download a Learning Guide for this episode, and all of our current episodes by going there and becoming an ESL Podcast member to help support this podcast.  This episode is called “Making Controversial Comments.”  It is a dialogue between Vivian and William using a lot of vocabulary that would describe comments or remarks – things that you say – that would make other people angry.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Vivian:  That news commentator should be fired for making such inflammatory comments.  At least I won’t watch this show again until she is.  William:  As usual, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill.  She was just expressing her opinion, albeit a controversial one.  Vivian:  Her opinion is offensive.  Mark my words: Before the end of the week, a lot of people will be up in arms calling for her head on a platter.  William:  I doubt it.  It’ll all blow over.  It’s just a tempest in a teapot.    Vivian:  No way.  She’ll never get away with it.    William:  Oh, yeah?  Vivian:  Yeah.  William:  Do you want to make a bet?    Vivian:  Sure, I’ll take that bet.  What does the winner get?  William:  Just the pleasure of seeing the other person eat her words. # To Forgive and Forget

Angela:  I may have.  Okay, I did.  Luc:  Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t you and Barbara have a knock-down, drag-out fight last month?  Angela:  We may have.  Luc:  And didn’t you say that you’d never speak to her again much less invite her over to our house? # Vacationing on an Island

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 671: Vacationing on an Island.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 671.  I am your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful – and I do mean beautiful – Los Angeles, California.

Oh, I should mention that our website is eslpod.com , and you can download a Learning Guide to this episode on the website.

This is an episode called “Vacationing on an Island ,” let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mohsen:  I need to get off this island.  I’m gettin g island fever.

Ella:  We’ve only been here two days.  Give it a ch ance.  We’re here to enjoy a slower pace of life, remember?

Mohsen:  When you said we were going on an island v acation, I didn’t know we’d be so isolated.  There isn’t a living soul within f ive miles!

Ella:  This isn’t isolated; it’s secluded.  We have  privacy and serenity.  Isn’t that what we wanted?

Mohsen:  I wanted a vacation with all of the creatu re comforts.

Ella:  That’s what we have, don’t you think?  We’re  staying in a very nice house.

Mohsen:  Yes, but what about the creature comforts?   I have no Internet access and no cell phone service.  This is what I call rou ghing it.

Ella:  We agreed that we both needed a little time away to unwind.  The whole point of this vacation is for us to relax.

Mohsen:  I’m cut off from civilization and I have n o access to email and my favorite websites.  What could be more stressful th an this?!

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Mohsen saying to Ella, “ I need to get off this island.” “To get off,” here, means to leave.  Mohsen needs t o get off this island.  An “island,” of course, is an area of land completely surrounded by water.  Great Britain – at least England, Scotland, and Wales – i s an island.  Ireland is an island.  Hawaii is a state with a number of differe nt islands.  Mohsen says he’s getting island fever.  A “fever” (fever) is normall y when your body has a very high temperature, too high because you are sick.  Here, however, it means feeling anxious when you cannot move around freely; because  of where you are, you feel as though you are trapped.  You can’t move and  travel the way you want to because you’re on an island, and you can only go so  far and then there’s the water.  So, “island fever” is this idea that you ne ed to leave this place because you feel that you are limited somehow.  Now, we hav e the same idea when we are talking about people not on islands, we call th at “cabin (cabin) fever.”  “Cabin fever” is when you are in a place and perhaps becau se of the weather or some other reason you can’t leave and you want to, and s o you start getting very anxious about it.  You start getting uncomfortable.   A “cabin” is like a small, little house that would be outside of the city near a lake  or in the mountains.

Ella says, “We’ve only been here for two days.  Giv e it a chance,” meaning even if it’s bad right now, wait a little longer.  “Give  it time,” we might also say.  “Give it a chance.  We’re here to enjoy a slower pace of lif e, remember?”  The “pace (pace) of life” is like the speed that things are d one in a particular culture or in a particular situation.  To have a slow pace of life means to be very relaxed; you don’t hurry around.  Or, a certain culture – a cert ain area has a different pace of life.  The pace of life in New York City – in Manha ttan – is very different than the pace of life on a farm in Minnesota, very different  speeds that things happen.

Well, Ella and Mohsen are on this island to relax, but Mohsen says, “When you said we were going on an island vacation, I didn’t know we’d be so isolated.”  “To be isolated” means to be far away from other people ; it may also mean you don’t have communication with other people because you ar e so far away from them. Mohsen says, “There isn’t a living soul within five  miles!”  The expression “a living soul” (soul) just means a human being.  In many phi losophies and religions, the human being has a physical body but also has a spir itual soul, sort of your being that is not physical, what is not physical that is part of you that makes who you are.  That’s the idea.  So, a “living soul” would b e another human being, and Mohsen says there is not a living soul within five miles, meaning you could travel five miles from where you are now and you would not  see another person.

Ella says, “This isn’t isolated; it’s secluded.”  “ Secluded” (secluded) is something that is being used by a very few number of people, without other people near them.  It’s really the same phenomenon – the same s ituation as “isolated,” but it’s

a positive thing usually.  “We’re going to a seclud ed beach,” we’re going to a beach that has very few people, that very few peopl e perhaps even know about. So it’s a positive thing, whereas “isolated” is a n egative thing.

Okay, so Mohsen is not very happy.  Ella’s trying t o make him happier by saying that it’s not isolated; it’s secluded.  “We have pr ivacy and serenity.”  “Privacy” is the ability to keep things secret, to not have othe r people around you in this situation.  “Serenity” is calmness; we might also s ay “tranquility.”  It’s a feeling of peace and relaxation – “serenity” (serenity).  Ella  then asks, “Isn’t that what we wanted (isn’t that what we wanted for our relaxing vacation)?”  Mohsen says, “I wanted a vacation with all of the creature comforts .”  “Creature (creature) comforts (comforts)” are things that are not necess ary to live but make you feel relaxed, things that help you.  Having a hot shower , having good food, these are creature comforts; they’re things that make you com fortable, things that make you feel better, feel good.  Ella says, “That’s wha t we have, don’t we?” meaning we have creature comforts here.  “We’re staying in a very nice house.”  I should also mention that the word “creature” is often used  for a living being, not just human beings; in fact, usually it refers to animals : “Get that creature out of my house!  You know I don’t want dogs in here.”  The d og is the creature.  It has sort of a negative meaning about it when referring to an imals – not always, but sometimes.  When I use it, it always does!

Ella says that they’re staying in a nice house, and  Mohsen says, “Yes, but what about the creature comforts?  I have no Internet ac cess and no cell phone service.”  “Internet access” is, of course, the abi lity to go online to find information, to read your emails, and so forth.  “C ell phone” is the same as “mobile phone” or “cellular phone.”  It’s a phone t hat you can carry with you. “Service” means that you are able to use the phone,  that you have the ability to send the electronic signals to the telephone compan y so that you can talk to people.  If you are out in a very isolated area the  telephone company may not have service there.  That is, you may not be able t o use their phone in that area. Mohsen says, “This is what I call roughing it.”  the expression “to rough (rough) it” means to go camping or spend time outdoors with out the nice things you have at home.  “To rough it” could mean to live without technology that you are used to: no television, no cell phones, no iPods or iPad s or i-whatever.  That’s to rough it.

Mohsen thinks that he is roughing it; he thinks tha t this is very uncomfortable. Ella says, “We agreed that we both needed a little time away to unwind.”  “Away” here simply means at a distance from where they nor mally live and work.  “To unwind” (unwind) means to relax and become calmer, especially after a period of time where you are very stressed.  So you come home  from work, you’ve had a

difficult day, you sit down in front of the televis ion, you get a glass of wine or a bottle of beer or something else, and you unwind – you relax.  You watch the Dodgers on television, the local baseball station, or you watch some other program, or you read, whatever; all of this is part  of unwinding.  Ella says, “The whole point of this vacation is for us to relax.”  “The whole point” means the main idea or objective, the most important reason why we  are doing something; it’s a very common expression.  “The whole point of going to a restaurant is not having to cook and clean,” that’s one example.

Mohsen says, “I’m cut off from civilization and I h ave no access to email and my favorite websites.”  “To be cut off from (something )” means to be separated from something.  “Civilization” here just means the mode rn world, where you have technology and creature comforts.  Mohsen thinks th at he’s cut off; he’s separated from civilization because he doesn’t have  email and Internet access. He then says, “What could be more stressful than th is?!”  “To be stressful” means that you are worried, you are anxious, you feel lik e you have many things to do and not very much time to do them in.  I feel this way all time; I guess I need a vacation on an island!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal rate of speech.

[start of dialogue]

Mohsen:  I need to get off this island.  I’m gettin g island fever.

Ella:  We’ve only been here two days.  Give it a ch ance.  We’re here to enjoy a slower pace of life, remember?

Mohsen:  When you said we were going on an island v acation, I didn’t know we’d be so isolated.  There isn’t a living soul within f ive miles!

Ella:  This isn’t isolated; it’s secluded.  We have  privacy and serenity.  Isn’t that what we wanted?

Mohsen:  I wanted a vacation with all of the creatu re comforts.

Ella:  That’s what we have, don’t you think?  We’re  staying in a very nice house.

Mohsen:  Yes, but what about the creature comforts?   I have no Internet access and no cell phone service.  This is what I call rou ghing it.

Ella:  We agreed that we both needed a little time away to unwind.  The whole point of this vacation is for us to relax.

Mohsen:  I’m cut off from civilization and I have n o access to email and my favorite websites.  What could be more stressful th an this?!

# Asking for More Time

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 672: Asking for More Time.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number  672.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download the Learning Guide for this episode that will improve your English – and make y our teeth just a little whiter!

This episode is a dialogue between Dan and Marcia.  It’s called “Asking for More Time,” more time to do something.  Let’s get starte d.

[start of dialogue]

Dan:  Hello.

Marcia:  Hi, Dan.  What’s the status on the project ?  We’re still on schedule, right?

Dan:  Uh, well, I’ve been meaning to call you about  that.  We’ve had a slight delay.

Marcia:  What do you mean by “slight”?  Are you say ing that you won’t be able to meet the deadline?

Dan:  Not exactly.  I’m only asking that you grant us a short extension.

Marcia:  How short?

Dan:  A week or two, tops.  We hit a minor snag, bu t we should have everything up and running in no time.

Marcia:  If the project has come to a grinding halt , then it doesn’t sound like a minor snag.  We’re running on a tight schedule and we don’t have a lot of time to spare.

Dan:  I know that all too well.

Marcia:  Good, then I don’t have to spell it out for you.

 Dan:  No, you don’t.  My head is on the chopping bl ock and the clock is ticking.

[end of dialogue]

Dan begins by saying “Hello” to Marcia.  Marcia say s, “Hi, Dan.  What’s the status on the project?”  The “status” (status) is t he current condition, the most up- to-date, the newest information we have about this project, this thing that you are working on.  Marcia says, “We’re still on schedule,  right?”  “To be on schedule” means be on time, that you are progressing – you ar e moving forward just as you had planned.  If you’re late in completing the diff erent parts of the project, we would say you were “behind schedule,” and if you ar e making better progress than you anticipated – than you planned, then we wo uld say you are “ahead of schedule.”  So there’s “ahead of schedule,” “behind  schedule,” and “on schedule.”

Dan says, “Uh, well, I’ve been meaning to call you about that.”  “I’ve been meaning to” means I was planning on, I was thinking  about it, I should have called you.  He says, “We’ve had a slight delay.”  “Slight” (slight) here means very small; “minor,” we might say.  “Minor” (minor)  is something that is not very important; the opposite would be “major,” something  very important.  But “slight” means minor, unimportant.  There are other meanings  for the word “slight,” and those can be found in our Learning Guide.

So Dan says there has been a slight delay.  A “dela y” is something that causes you to be behind schedule – to be late.  Marcia say s, “What do you mean by ‘slight’?”  She’s asking Dan to say how unimportant  or how minor this delay is. “Are you saying that you won’t be able to meet the deadline?”  The “deadline” (one word) is the date and sometimes the time that something is supposed to be done, that something needs to be completed by.  “Th e deadline is 5:30 p.m. on Friday.”  That means whatever you’re doing has to b e done by 5:30 in the afternoon on Friday.

So Marcia is asking not too bright, not too smart, we get the impression, Dan – we’ll call him dumb Dan – Marcia’s asking dumb Dan if he is going to be able to meet the deadline.  “To meet the deadline” means to  be completed before or by the deadline.  Actually, I guess, Marcia says, “Are  you saying that you won’t (that you will not) be able to meet the deadline?”  Dan s ays, “Not exactly.”  “Not exactly” means “no,” but it implies – it gives you the idea that there is something wrong.  Now we find out what is wrong, what Dan is really saying.  He says, “I’m only asking that you grant us a short extension.”  “To grant (something to someone)” as a verb means to give someone something , usually officially, like a

government giving something to one of its citizens or an organization giving something to an individual person.  Here, it means really to give permission, to say “yes, okay.”  Dan is asking for a short extensi on.  An “extension” here means when you are given more time to do something.  If t he deadline was Friday at five p.m., and you’re not going to be finished by then, you might ask for an extension until Monday at five p.m.

Marcia says, “How short?” meaning how short of an e xtension.  How much more time do you want dumb Dan?  Well, she doesn’t say “ dumb Dan,” but that’s what she means – right?  So Dan says, “A week or two, to ps.”  “Tops” is an informal way of saying maximum, at most.  In other words, it  won’t be more than that.  So, Dan says, “A week or two weeks, tops.  We hit a min or snag, but we should have everything up and running in no time.”  A “snag (or  snag)” (snag) is a problem; a small problem, but still a problem that prevents yo u from completing something, that causes a delay.  “Snag” has a few other meanin gs, and those can be found in the Learning Guide – of course!  Where else woul d you find them?

Dumb Dan says, “we should have everything up and ru nning in no time.”  The expression “to have (something) up and running” mea ns something will be working normally, functioning as it should function , doing what it’s supposed to be doing.  Marcia says, “If the project has come to  a grinding halt, then it doesn’t sound like a minor snag.”  The expression “to come to a grinding halt” (halt) means to completely stop.  You could have a car tra veling down the street and suddenly you see a dog come out into the street and  you step on, or press on, your brakes to stop the car, but you stop it very q uickly.  We would say “it came to a grinding halt,” it stopped quickly.  Actually,  we don’t use this expression very often in talking about actual movement; usually we use it in talking about some sort of project or process that stops, that suddenl y stops, that completely stops. Marcia says if the project has stopped – if you’ve stopped making progress on it – then it’s not a minor snag, it would be a major s nag.  Marcia says, “We’re running on (meaning we’re operating on) a tight sch edule and we don’t have a lot of time to spare.”  A “tight schedule” is a situati on where a lot of work needs to be done but in a very small amount of time.  If you on ly have two days to finish writing a book, that might be a very tight schedule  if you haven’t started writing already.  By the way, the opposite of a “tight sche dule” would not be a “loose schedule,” we wouldn’t say that.  You might say som ething like, “We have plenty of time,” or even, “We have all the time in the wor ld.”  There’s no rush; there’s no hurry.  With a tight schedule you have to hurry, yo u have to rush; you don’t have a lot of time.

Marcia says they don’t have a lot of time, they don ’t have a lot of time to spare (spare).  “To spare” is to have an extra amount of something.  It’s used as an

adjective when we are talking about something extra  that you have.  For example in your car, you should have a spare tire.  That’s an extra tire to put on your car in case you have problems with one of them.  In fac t, we typically call it just “a spare,” using “spare” there as a noun.  Here, it me ans they don’t have any extra time.

Dan says, “I know that all too well,” meaning I kno w it very well; I understand completely.  Marcia says, “Good, then I don’t have to spell it out for you.”  “To spell (something) out” can mean to give the letters  in the word, like I spell out words like “spare” (spare).  But the same expressio n also means to explain something in great detail, to talk about every litt le part of this thing you are trying to describe, to be very explicit.  Marcia is saying  that she does not need to spell it out for Dan – for dumb Dan; that’s another way of s aying “I don’t need to explain to you how serious the situation is.”  Sometimes, e specially when we’re giving someone bad news or telling them something they don ’t want to hear, we’ll use the opposite expression; we’ll say, “Let me spell i t out for you.  If you don’t give me my money I’m going to call the police!”

Dan says, “No, you don’t (you don’t need to spell i t out for me; you don’t need to explain what will happen to me if I don’t finish th is project on time – on schedule). My head is on the chopping block and the clock is t icking.”  The expression “to have your head on the chopping block” means for one  to be at risk of losing your job or otherwise having a very negative consequence  if they don’t do what they’re supposed to do.  It used to be, back in his tory and perhaps in some places still is, common to kill someone, especially  when the government was killing a criminal, to put their head on a piece of  wood and take a large “ax,” which is a sharp metal instrument used normally to cut trees, and chop or cut the head of the person off so that, of course, they wou ld die.  That’s the idea.  Well, we don’t do that anymore, at least not very often.  But the expression continues and it means now to be in trouble, to have some ser ious problems if you don’t finish or do what you’re supposed to do.  Dan says,  “the clock is ticking.”  This means simply that there is very little time left be fore something happens.  He has to hurry because there isn’t a lot of time left.  “ To tick” (tick) is the verb we use, or used to use clocks or watches because when the litt le wheel inside the clock moved around it made a little sound – “tick, tick, tick” – and that is why we talk about clocks ticking.  Clocks don’t tick anymore – most of them don’t because they’re electronic, but we still have the expressio n.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Dan:  Hello.

Marcia:  Hi, Dan.  What’s the status on the project ?  We’re still on schedule, right?

Dan:  Uh, well, I’ve been meaning to call you about  that.  We’ve had a slight delay.

Marcia:  What do you mean by “slight”?  Are you say ing that we won’t be able to meet the deadline?

Dan:  Not exactly.  I’m only asking that you grant us a short extension.

Marcia:  How short?

Dan:  A week or two, tops.  We hit a minor snag, bu t we should have everything up and running in no time.

Marcia:  If the project has come to a grinding halt , then it doesn’t sound like a minor snag.  We’re running on a tight schedule and we don’t have a lot of time to spare.

Dan:  I know that all too well.

Marcia:  Good, then I don’t have to spell it out for you.

Dan:  No, you don’t.  My head is on the chopping bl ock and the clock is ticking.

# Walking or Running as Exercise

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 673: Walking or Running as an Exercise.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 673.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com, you probably know that.  But did you know we also have Learning Guides for all of our current episode  on our website that you can download?  You knew that too, huh?  Okay.  You thin k you’re pretty smart, don’t you?!

This episode is called “Walking or Running as Exerc ise.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Reina:  Okay, I’m ready to walk my way to better fi tness!

Lars:  I’m glad you’re so enthusiastic about starti ng to exercise.

Reina:  I’m totally psyched!  Check out my new tenn is shoes.

Lars:  They’re brand new?  You haven’t broken them in yet?  I hope you don’t get blisters.

Reina:  Stop worrying.  Let’s go, I’m ready to work  up a sweat!

Lars:  Wait.  There are a few things you need to kn ow before we start.  It’s a good idea to stretch and to warm up to avoid injuri es.

Reina:  I stretched already and as soon as we get s tarted, I’ll warm up slowly. Let’s go!

Lars:  All right, here we go, nice and slow.

Reina:  Come on!  How are we supposed to increase o ur heart rate if we walk this slowly?  Pick up the pace!

Lars:  I don’t want to get shin splints.  It’s impo rtant that we start slowly and maintain a low-impact workout.

 Reina:  Forget it!  I’ll race you.  The last one to  the park buys lunch.  Ready, set, go!

Lars:  Wait!

[end of dialogue]

Reina begins our dialogue by saying to Lars, “Okay,  I’m ready to walk my way to better fitness!”  “Fitness” is the level of your he alth and your strength, your ability to complete certain physical activities without a l ot of difficulty.  If you have problems walking up 10 stairs you may need to work on your fitness; you may need to exercise – to do exercises.  Reina’s going to walk her way to better fitness, meaning she’s going to help her health and  her strength by walking; that’s her way – her method.

Lars says, “I’m glad you’re so enthusiastic about s tarting to exercise.”  To exercise,” of course, is to do some physical activi ty that will make your body stronger or healthier.  Reina says, “I’m totally ps yched!”  “To be psyched” (psyched) is an informal expression meaning to be v ery excited about something, to be very eager and enthusiastic to do something.  When it means this, it always ends in “ed” – “psyched.”  The word “psych” has oth er meanings, which are not found in our Learning Guide – not this one anyway.  Reina says, “Check out my new tennis shoes.”  “Tennis” is a game, but “tennis  shoes” are a kind of shoes that you can wear when playing tennis but you can a lso wear them for other sports.  It’s a type of shoe you would wear to part icipate in different physical or sporting activities, so it’s not just for tennis.  When spoken normally the two words run together so it sounds like “tennis-shoes. ”  Informally, you might even hear someone talk about their “tennies,” meaning th eir tennis shoes.

Lars says, “They’re brand new (referring to the ten nis shoes)?”  “To be brand new” means to be recently purchased; you bought the m yesterday or this morning.  They’ve never been used before, that’s an other meaning here of “brand new.”  Lars says, “You haven’t broken them i n yet?”  “To break (something) in,” or “to break in (something)” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to wear something, especially shoes, for short peri ods of time until your feet get used to the shoes, until the shoes begin to perhaps  loosen up a little bit so that it isn’t uncomfortable to walk in them.  So when you b uy a new pair of shoes you may wear them the first day for a couple of hours, the second and third day for a couple of hours until gradually you’re wearing them  all the time, a little bit more each day.  There are other meanings of this express ion “to break in,” those can be found in our Learning Guide.  You see, those you  can actually find in the

Learning Guide!  Lars continues, “I hope you don’t get blisters.”  A “blister” (blister) is a small, usually painful, raised area of skin that is filled usually with some sort of clear liquid.  It’s caused when you ru b a certain part of your body against something for a long time.  So if you’re we aring shoes that are too small for you, the shoes will rub against your skin and y ou will get blisters.

Reina says, “Stop worrying.”  She’s not going to ge t blisters, that’s which she’s implying.  She says, “Let’s go, I’m ready to work u p a sweat!”  The expression “to work up a sweat” means to do very difficult physica l activity that will result or that will have the cause of water coming out of your ski n.  When that happens, or when you’re very hot, we say you are “sweating.”  T hat’s what Reina wants to do; she wants to sweat – to work up a sweat.

Lars says, “Wait.  There are a few things you need to know before we start.  It’s a good idea to stretch and to warm up to avoid injuri es.”  “To stretch” (stretch) here means to move the different parts of your body – yo ur arms and your legs, for example – in sort of unusual ways so that the muscl es begin to work, so that your muscles are more flexible.  You might put your hand s up in the air or put one hand against the other and start to pull.  That wou ld be stretching.  You’ll often see athletes stretch before they participate in the ir sport.  The theory is – and not everyone agrees this is true – but the theory is by  stretching you will avoid injuries, meaning you won’t hurt yourself.  For oth er meanings of the word “stretch” take a look at that Learning Guide.  “To warm up” means to do a physical activity gently or slowly for the first fe w minutes.  So for example, if you are going to go running you may run slowly for the first four or five minutes until your body and muscles start getting used to what yo u are doing, and then you may start running faster.

Reina says, “I stretched already and as soon as we get started, I’ll warm up slowly.  Let’s go!”  Reina just wants to start.  La rs says, “All right, here we go, nice and slow,” meaning very slowly, comfortably.  Reina says, “Come on!”  That expression, “come on,” when shouted at someone, can  mean that you are frustrated with them or it could mean that you want  them to go faster.  Reina probably has a little bit of both of those meanings .  She says, “How are we supposed to increase our heart rate if we walk this  slowly?  Pick up the pace!” Your “heart rate” is the speed at which your heart “beats” (beats), which is the verb we use for the movements of the heart – the mo vements that the heart muscle makes.  “To increase your heart rate” means that your heart will start beating faster; it will start working harder.

Reina wants Lars to pick up the pace (pace).  “To p ick up the pace” means to begin to do something more quickly, to move more qu ickly, to hurry.  Lars says, “I

don’t want to get shin splints.”  Your “shin” (shin ) is the part of your leg – the front of your leg between your knee and your foot.  “Shin  splints” is a condition where you experience pain in that part of your body, ofte n caused by running on very hard surfaces or wearing shoes that are not appropr iate, that aren’t good for running.  Lars says, “It’s important that we start slowly and maintain a low-impact workout.”  “Low-impact” is an exercise that doesn’t  require that your body be moving or jumping or running on a hard surface; it’ s also a general term for exercise that isn’t very difficult, it’s sort of ea sier than doing other kinds of exercise.  The noun “workout” is a session or a sho rt period of time of doing some sort of physical activity, especially if you d o it regularly.  I work out Monday through Friday by walking every morning; that’s my workout.  Notice I also used “work out” (two words) as a verb, meaning to exerci se.  Here it’s used as a noun; it means that period of time when you are exercisin g.

So Lars wants to do a low-impact workout.  Reina sa ys, “Forget it!” meaning I’m frustrated with you, I’m tired of you, I’m not goin g to do that.  Reina says, “I’ll race you.”  “To race (someone)” is to see who can run, i n this case, the fastest, who can do the activity the quickest.  Reina says, “The  last one to the park buys lunch,” meaning they’re going to race – they’re goi ng to compete against each other, and the last person to arrive at the park wh ere they’re going in their run or walk has to buy lunch.  If you lose, in other words , you have to buy lunch.  Reina says, “Ready, set, go!”  These three words are trad itionally used to begin a race. “Ready, set, go,” and then you begin after the word  “go.”  It’s sort of like “three, two, one,” but we use this expression, at least in American English, “ready, set, go.”

We’re not sure, in this dialogue, if Lars is lazy o r Reina is not too smart and may injure herself!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Reina:  Okay, I’m ready to walk my way to better fi tness!

Lars:  I’m glad you’re so enthusiastic about starti ng to exercise.

Reina:  I’m totally psyched!  Check out my new tenn is shoes.

Lars:  They’re brand new?  You haven’t broken them in yet?  I hope you don’t get blisters.

Reina:  Stop worrying.  Let’s go, I’m ready to work  up a sweat!

# Threatening Other Countries

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 674: Threatening Other Countries.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 674.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.

In this episode, we’re going to hear a conversation  between Tania and Emilio about threatening other countries.  When two countr ies are having difficulties, shall we say, and might even in fact start fighting  each other.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tania:  Did you see the news today?  Canada has bee n doing military exercises near the Canada-U.S. border.  I think they’re tryin g to send us a message.

Emilio:  They’re just saber-rattling.  They think w e’re amassing weapons near the border and they’re posturing.

Tania:  I don’t think they’re just posturing.

Emilio:  Canada is no real threat.  No one in the g overnment wants to bear the responsibility of violating Canada’s treaty with us .

Tania:  How can you say that?  All of this military  aggression makes me nervous. If Canada decides to attack, we would have no choic e but to retaliate.  Things could escalate very quickly.

Emilio:  That’s why I’m well prepared.

Tania:  Well prepared?  How?

Emilio:  Haven’t you seen me building my undergroun d bunker?  I’ll be safe there if Canada, or anyone else, strikes.

Tania:  An underground bunker?

Emilio:  Yes, and if you ask nicely, I’ll save a pl ace for you.

[end of dialogue]

Tania begins by saying to Emilio, “Did you see the news today (the news reports or the newspaper)?  Canada has been doing military exercises near the Canada- U.S. border.”  “Military exercises” are one way tha t the military – the army and the navy – use to train.  It is sort of like a fake  war; they test their systems to make sure that everything is working, that their so ldiers know what to do, and so forth.  Sometimes it’s called a “war game” in fact.   The “border” is the line that divides two countries or states or provinces.  It’s  a geographic line that separates two pieces of land.

In the dialogue, Canada is apparently mad at the Un ited States and their military – their army and navy – is doing military exercises  near the border.  Tania says, “I think they’re trying to send us a message.”  “To  send (someone) a message” means to make sure that the person understands exac tly what you’re thinking without necessarily saying it directly to them.  So , we’re communicating something but it isn’t necessarily in words.

Emilio says, “They (meaning the evil Canadians) are  just saber-rattling.”  A “saber” (saber) is a large sword that’s sharp that you could kill someone with. “To rattle” (rattle) is to make a noise.  Often whe n you have pieces of metal that are next to each other they may make a noise like t his: [rattling sound].  That wasn’t a saber, those were actually the pens that I  have in this blue cup I keep here next my microphone that has a lot of pens and pencils and that sort of thing. I guess you use a pen to kill someone – possible.  Anyway, “saber-rattling” is an old expression that means a certain country is tryi ng to demonstrate or show someone else that they are militarily powerful.  So , they may do military exercises or they may do things that show their mil itary in action.  That’s saber- rattling.

Emilio says, “They (the Canadians) think we’re amas sing weapons near the border and they’re posturing.”  “To amass” (amass) means to collect or gather as many items of a certain thing as you can and put th em all in one place.  I have amassed several pens and pencils in my blue cup her e on the desk.  A “weapon” is something that will hurt you, something physical  typically, a tool, if you will, for hurting someone: a knife, a gun, that sort of thing  – a pen.  So Canada thinks the U.S. is amassing weapons near the border, and the C anadians, in response to this, are posturing.  “To posture” (posture) as a v erb means to present yourself in a certain way to convey a certain impression on the  other person.  It’s often used

in the negative sense of someone who’s trying to be  something they’re not, or someone who perhaps is doing this for no good reaso n.

Tania says, “I don’t think they’re just posturing.”   They’re not just acting this way, they really are angry – because everyone knows, Can adians can get very angry! Emilio says, “Canada is no real threat.”  A “threat ” is a risk, something that can cause harm or damage.  Emilio says, “No one in the government wants to bear the responsibility of violating Canada’s treaty wit h us.”  “To bear (bear – just like the animal) the responsibility” means to admit when  something has gone wrong and accept the consequences.  Another expression we  might use is “to be held accountable.”  So no one in the government wants to  bear the responsibility – wants to have the responsibility of “violating,” or  breaking, not following Canada’s treaty with us.  A “treaty” is a formal agreement b etween two countries to do something or not do something.  The Treaty of Versa illes ended World War I; the SALT, or Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, helped r educe the number of nuclear weapons between the United States and the then Sovi et Union.

Tania says, “How can you say that?  All of this mil itary aggression makes me nervous.”  “Aggression” is when someone is angry or  mad and actually does something about it.  Military aggression would be w hen the military is showing their power – is showing their strength because the ir country is angry.  She says, “If Canada decides to attack, we would have no choi ce but to retaliate.”  “To attack” means to begin a fight or a battle.  Usuall y it’s something between two armies, but it could be two people.  “He was attack ed by a dog last night,” the dog tried to bite him.  Or, “She was attacked by the mean cat that was in the neighbors’ yard.”  These, of course, are our real t hreats: cats and dogs!  But, going back to our back to our story – I’m kidding, of course.  Going back to our story, Tania says, “we would have no choice (if Can ada decides to attack) but to retaliate.”  When we say “we have no choice but to (do something)” we mean we have no other option, we must do this.  In this cas e, we must retaliate.  “To retaliate” (retaliate) means to do something bad to  another person after he or she has done something bad to you.  It’s similar to ano ther word: “revenge.” “Retaliate” usually is related to someone trying to  hurt you – someone trying to hurt your country, and you then attack them back to  defend yourself.  Tania says, “Things could escalate very quickly.”  “To escalate ” (escalate) means to increase the importance or seriousness or intensity of somet hing, to involve more people, to move something to a higher level, to make it mor e serious, to make it bigger perhaps.  So when two countries start fighting with  each other, sometimes the violence can escalate.  They kill 5 people, and the n you kill 10 of their people, and they retaliate and kill 25 of your people.  Tha t’s escalating violence; it’s getting worse and worse as we go forward in time.

Emilio says to this possibility of escalation (the noun of “to escalate”), “That’s why I’m well prepared (I’m ready),” Emilio says.  Tania  asks him, “Well prepared? How?”  How are you well prepared?  Emilio says, “Ha ven’t you seen me building my underground bunker?”  “Underground” is something  that is below the ground, in the earth.  A “bunker” (bunker) is a strong, saf e place where you are protected against some military attack; you are underground.  So, an “underground bunker” is a place where you could be safe if you were atta cked or your country was attacked, that’s the idea.  There were some people,  especially back in the 50s and 60s, that built bunkers in their houses because  they were afraid of a nuclear attack on the United States.  I’m not sure if the b unker would have helped very much!  Anyway, Emilio says, “I’ll be safe there (in  my bunker) if Canada, or anyone else, strikes.”  “To strike” here means to h it someone or to attack someone; to send a bomb, that’s an example of strik ing.  There was a movie, one of the Star Wars  movies, The Empire Strikes Back , meaning the Empire attacks after being attacked.

Tania says, “An underground bunker?”  Emilio says, “Yes, and if you ask nicely (if you’re nice to me), I’ll save a place for you.”   So that’s what some people are doing preparing for Canada’s attack on the United S tates!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tania:  Did you see the news today?  Canada has bee n doing military exercises near the Canada-U.S. border.  I think they’re tryin g to send us a message.

Emilio:  They’re just saber-rattling.  They think w e’re amassing weapons near the border and they’re posturing.

Tania:  I don’t think they’re just posturing.

Emilio:  Canada is no real threat.  No one in the g overnment wants to bear the responsibility of violating Canada’s treaty with us .

Tania:  How can you say that?  All of this military  aggression makes me nervous. If Canada decides to attack, we would have no choic e but to retaliate.  Things could escalate very quickly.

Emilio:  That’s why I’m well prepared.

Tania:  Well prepared?  How?

Tania:  An underground bunker?

# Having Furniture Delivered

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 675: Having Furniture Delivered.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 675.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com and download a Lear ning Guide for this episode – and for life, really.  It will help you in many t hings.

This episode is a dialogue between Zuly and Danny a bout when you buy “furniture” – a bed, a couch, a chair – and the com pany or store delivers it to your house.  We’ll see what happens when there are some problems in that process. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I was waiting patiently for the furniture store to deliver my new bed.  I was given a window of 1:00 to 4:00.  At 4:50, the delivery truc k pulled up in front of my house. ……

Zuly:  Hello.

Danny:  Hi!  We’re from Reliable Furniture.  We’re here to deliver your new bed.

Zuly:  I thought you’d never get here.  The new bed  should go in the bedroom. Follow me.  You’ll haul away the old bed, right?

Danny:  We will for an extra charge.

Zuly:  I thought that was included in the price of the new bed.

Danny:  Let me check the paperwork.  Oh, I guess it  is.  We’ll take away the old bed and bring in the new one.

Zuly:  Okay, this way.  You can bring the bed right  in here.

Danny:  Okay, here you are.  We’re all done.

Zuly:  Aren’t you guys going to remove the bubble w rap, assemble the pieces, and set up the bed?

Danny:  We can, but it’ll cost extra.

Zuly:  I’m sure that’s included in the price of the  new bed.

Danny:  Let me check…Okay, I guess we’ll set it up.   We’re just running a little late, that’s all.  We got a late start from the war ehouse this morning and it’s already past quitting time. ……

I wasn’t too happy, to say the least, but I was at their mercy and didn’t say anything.  But as soon as they’re finished, I’ll be  ready to give them a piece of my mind!

[end of dialogue]

Zuly begins by telling us the background – the sett ing of our story.  She says, “I was waiting patiently for the furniture store (the place where she bought a piece of furniture, such as a bed, a couch, or a chair) t o deliver my new bed.”  I should say that “furniture” is always singular; we would n ever say “furnitures,” even though it refers to many different objects – many d ifferent we would say “pieces of furniture.”  She’s waiting for the store to “del iver” her bed, to take it from their store and bring it to her house.  She says, “I was given a window of 1:00 to 4:00.” A “window” in this case means a period of time duri ng which something will happen.  It’s very common in the U.S. when you have  someone delivering furniture or someone coming to your house to fix yo ur telephone – for lots of different services – that the company will give you  not a specific time but a range of time, what we would call a “window.”  In this ca se, they could come any time between 1:00 and 4:00.  It’s very inconvenient for the person who is buying the service or thing, but that’s just the way a lot of companies do things here.  I always find it rather annoying.  In any case, Zuly says, “At 4:50 (meaning 50 minutes after the end of the window – 50 minutes la te), the delivery truck pulled up in front of my house.”  The “delivery truck” is the large vehicle that will deliver things.  “To pull up” is a two-word phrasal verb me aning to drive to a place and stop there, especially in front a building or a hou se.  “To pull up,” it’s used with your car.

So, the truck pulled up in front of her house, and then we get the actual dialogue. Zuly says, “Hello.”  Danny, who works for the deliv ery company or the store, says, “Hi!  We’re from Reliable Furniture.  We’re h ere to deliver your new bed.”

Something that is “reliable” is something that is d ependable, that you can count on.  Of course, they’re 50 minutes late, so they’re  not actually very reliable!  Zuly says, “I thought you’d never get here.”  The expres sion “I thought you’d never get here” is one you would use to let someone know that  they are much later than you expected.  Normally it communicates a certain a nnoyance, a certain anger perhaps at that person.  Zuly says, “The new bed sh ould go in the bedroom.” That’s where beds go usually, in the bedroom.  “Fol low me,” she says, walk behind me and go where I am going, “You’ll haul awa y the old bed, right?”  “To haul (haul) away (something)” is to take something away, take something from, say, a house or a building that is very large typic ally; it may be very heavy to lift. It’s something that you don’t need anymore.  So if your refrigerator breaks and you can’t fix it, you can buy a new refrigerator an d then have your old refrigerator hauled away.  Someone will it take away.  It’s a ph rasal verb we use especially in this circumstance.

So Zuly wants to make sure the movers will haul awa y her old bed – will take her old bed away and get rid of it, throw it out or do whatever one does with old beds. Danny says, “We will (we will haul it away) for an extra charge.”  An “extra charge” is an additional amount of money.  Zuly say s, “I thought that (the hauling away) was included in the price of the new bed.”  Z uly didn’t think she had to pay extra, or additional money.  Danny says, “Let me ch eck the paperwork.”  Let me look at the paper or the forms that were given to h im with instructions about what to deliver, where, and what services are included.  “Paperwork” is a general term that describes forms, pieces of paper you have to p ut information on, we would say “to fill out.”  That’s a general term that woul d be used in businesses and government offices.  Government offices typically h ave lots of paperwork if you ever want to get anything from them!  Danny checks his paperwork and realizes that he should not charge her more money for haulin g away the old bed, so he says, “Oh, I guess it is,” it is included in the pr ice that she already paid.  “We’ll take away the old bed and bring in the new one,” he  says.

Zuly then says, “Okay, this way (meaning follow me;  walk after me).  You can bring the bed right in here.”  So she walks, we gue ss, from the door of the house – the front door and goes to the bedroom and shows them where to put the bed, so they bring the bed in.  Danny then says, “Okay, here you are,” meaning this is what I am giving you; it is right here.  This is a very common expression. Someone may ask you for a pen to write with.  You t ake out a pen, and as you’re giving it to the person you may say, “here you are, ” or “here you go.”  In that case, they mean the same thing.  Danny says, “We’re  all done,” we are finished; we’ve completed our job.  But Zuly doesn’t think th ey’re finished, she says, “Aren’t you guys (you men – in this case perhaps – aren’t you) going to remove the bubble wrap, assemble the pieces, and set up the bed?”  “Bubble wrap” are

large pieces of plastic that have been put together  and they have lots of little, well, bubbles, which are sort of like little balloo ns that have air in them, and they’re all attached, and they’re put around someth ing to protect it.  They’re often used when you are mailing, for example, something t hat could break easily.  “To assemble” means to put together, to take things tha t are apart and put them together so that whatever you have is working.  “To  set up (something)” in this case means to put something into the correct positi on, put it where it’s supposed to be.  “Set up,” as a phrasal verb, can also be us ed to mean to put something together, to organize something, to get something r eady.

Danny says, “We can (we can do that), but it’ll cos t extra.”  It’ll be an extra charge again.  Zuly again doubts this, doesn’t think this is true.  She says, “I’m sure that’s included in the price of the new bed,” meani ng I already paid for that, you should do it.  Danny looks at his paper again; he s ays, “Let me check,” and realizes that yes, they’re supposed to do the thing s that Zuly is asking them to do, to set up the bed.  He says, “Okay, I guess we’ ll set it up.  We’re just running a little late, that’s all.”  “To run a little late”  means to be behind schedule, not to have made very much progress in what you are doing.   You planned to be finished by 5:00, it’s 5:30 and you’re still not fi nished; you’re running a little late. Danny says, “We got a late start from the warehouse  this morning,” meaning we left the warehouse later than we were planning to.  A “warehouse” (warehouse – one word) is a large building where many objects or  items are stored until they are needed.  So if you go to the store to buy a bed , they won’t usually have the bed there in the store for you; they will have it i n another building, which we would call a “warehouse,” where they put things unt il they can sell them.  Danny says, “it’s already past quitting time.”  “Quitting  time” is the end of your workday: 5:00 at night, 6:00 at night.  When you finish work ing; when you go home after working, that’s “quitting time.”

Zuly says, “I wasn’t too happy, to say the least.”  The phrase “to say the least” is used to show that what you just said is an understa tement, that you actually feel much more strongly than you have indicated.  So, so meone for example wins a million dollars and they say, “Well, I’m very happy , to say the least,” meaning they’re more than just very happy.  Zuly says she w asn’t too happy – she wasn’t very happy, to say the least, meaning she was reall y angry, “but I was at their mercy and didn’t say anything.”  “To be at (someone ’s) mercy” (mercy) is to be in a situation where someone else has control of what is happening, that you have to depend on another person to get something done.  It’s usually used when you’re in a situation you don’t want to be in, that  you don’t have the power that you want.  She says, “as soon as they’re finished ( as soon as Danny and his other workers finish setting up the bed), I’ll be r eady to give them a piece of my mind!”  “To give (someone) a piece of your mind” is  an expression meaning to tell

someone what you really think, especially when you’ re angry and upset, when you’re mad.  “Well, I’m going to give that guy a pi ece of my mind!”  I’m going to tell him what I really think, usually because you’r e angry.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Carol:  It’s open enrollment at my company and I’m thinking of switching health plans.  I have an HMO right now and I’m thinking of switching to a PPO.  That way, I can see doctors outside of my current network and still be covered.  Mikhail:  I’m so glad I don’t have to worry about things like that.  I’m still a dependent on my mother’s plan, at least for another year.  Carol:  Lucky you.  Look at all of this literature!  How am I supposed to make heads or tails of this to compare one plan with another?    Mikhail:  Wow, yeah, that’s really confusing.    Carol:  Tell me about it.  I want to know if these new plans have coverage for my pre-existing conditions and prescription drugs, and if not, what the out-of-pocket costs would be.    Mikhail:  Don’t look at me.    Carol:  And how am I supposed to figure out what my copay and deductible would be?    Mikhail:  You’re on your own on this one.  It’s all Greek to me!  [end of dialogue] # Feeding a Picky Eater

[start of dialogue]

Fumi:  You may have everyone else fooled, but I kno w the real reason for the success of this project.

Issac:  What?

Fumi:  You.  You’ve been working behind the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.  Without you, this project would have been sunk months ago.

Issac:  That’s nonsense.

Fumi:  No, it’s not.  I know you don’t like the lim elight, but you were the linchpin of this operation.  Without you, we’d all have egg on our faces today.

Issac:  You’re giving me way too much credit.  I do n’t want to hear another word about it.

Fumi:  I’m not surprised at your reaction.  Most un sung heroes like to keep a low profile.

Issac:  What?!  I’m nothing of the kind!

Fumi:  Yes, you are.  You’re far too modest.  And s oon, I won’t be the only one who thinks so!

Issac:  What are you proposing to do?

 Fumi:  Don’t worry.  I’m not planning a ticker-tape  parade, but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are arou nd here!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Fumi saying to Issac, “You  may have everyone else fooled, but I know the real reason for the success of this project.”  “To fool (fool) (someone)” means to trick them, to deceive them, to  make them believe something that isn’t true, that is false.  Fumi say s to Issac that he has been fooling – he has been lying, in some ways, to every one, but she knows the real reason why this project has been a success, whateve r project they’re working on. Issac says, “What?”  Fumi says, “You,” meaning you’ re the real reason for the success of this project.  She says, “You’ve been wo rking behind the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.”  the expression “to work behind the scenes” (scenes) means to do something that is necessary for a project to succeed but is not noticed by most people.  The oth er people involved don’t realize that you are doing this work; you’re doing it in secret in some ways.  A “scene” here refers, for example, to a play in a th eater, where you have what are basically big paintings that give you the impressio n that you are in a different place.  Those are called the “scenery,” and so “to work behind the scenes” is to be, if you will, part of the play but no one actual ly sees you.  That was me, by the way, in my high school play; I was in my high schoo l play.  In American high schools typically there’s at least one play or musi cal every year.  I was in mine, but I was on the lighting crew – so I turned the li ghts on and off!  So I was in the play, but I was working behind the scenes you see.  Not many people know that.

Anyway, Fumi says that Issac has been working behin d the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.  “To bolster” (b olster) means to make someone feel stronger and more confident, or simply  to improve something.  The expression “to be up to the task” means to be ready  and prepared to do something, to have the abilities or the qualificati ons to perform a certain job or task.  So, Fumi says that Issac was basically helpi ng other people in the project who were not doing their job or who were not capabl e – able to do their job.  She says, “Without you, this project would have been su nk months ago.”  “To be sunk” (sunk) literally means to be underwater, like  a ship.  If you sink a ship – “sunk” is the past of “sink” – then the ship, or bo at, is underwater.  “To be sunk,” then, is a general expression that means to fail, n ot to be successful.

Issac says, “That’s nonsense,” saying that what Fum i is telling him is wrong. Fumi says, “No, it’s not.”  She says, “I know you d on’t like the limelight, but you were the linchpin of this operation.”  The “limelig ht” (limelight – one word) is used

to indicate that you are getting a lot of attention , that everyone is looking at you and paying attention to you including, for example,  those in media: the television and newspaper people, and Internet bloggers, and wh atever.  Everyone is paying attention to you; you are in the limelight.  But, I ssac doesn’t like the limelight. Fumi says he was the linchpin of this operation.  A  “linchpin” (linchpin – one word) is the most important person or thing in a gr oup; it’s the person or thing that everyone else depends on for success.  Fumi sa ys, “Without you, we’d all have egg on our faces.”  The expression “to have eg g (egg) on your face” means that you would be embarrassed publicly, you would b e in a position where you would look stupid or foolish and everyone would kno w about it.  But Issac says, “You’re giving me way too much credit.”  “To give ( someone) too much credit” means to say that they did more than they actually have done.  That is, you are saying that they are wonderful, you are saying how great they’ve been, but they don’t really deserve that much praise – that much c redit.  The use of the word “way” here, as in “way too much credit,” is just an other way of saying too much credit – too, too much credit we might say, but we don’t say that in English.  It’s like it’s really too much credit.  “Way” has been u sed this way for a long time, but it has become more popular in conversational Englis h.  For example, you might say to your friend, “Do I have too much makeup on m y face?” and your friend says, “Way too much,” meaning you really have too m uch, yes.  My friends tell me that all the time!

So Issac says, “I don’t want to hear another word a bout it (I don’t want you to say anything else to me about what you think I have don e).”  Fumi says, “I’m not surprised at your reaction (the way that you reacte d to what I said).”  Most unsung heroes like to keep a low profile.”  An “uns ung hero” is a person who makes an important contribution to a successful pro ject but who is not recognized for what they do.  Someone who does some thing great but nobody hears about it, nobody knows about it, that would b e an unsung hero.  “To keep a low profile” means to do something in a way that ot her people will not notice.  It’s another way of saying that other people are not pay ing attention to you.  The opposite would be “to keep a high profile,” which m eans everyone knows what you’re doing; everyone knows where you are, for exa mple.  Issac says, “What?! I’m nothing of the kind!”  “To be nothing of the ki nd” means that you are not an example of what the other person was just talking a bout.  It’s a phrase that we use to deny, to say no, to disagree with something.   Fumi says that Issac is an unsung hero, and he says, “I’m nothing of the kind (no, I’m not).”  Fumi says, “Yes, you are.  You’re far too modest.”  “To be far  too modest” means to be very humble, not wanting to talk about your own accompli shments.  Notice that “far” here has the same meaning – the same function as the word “way.”  We could have said, “you’re way too modest,” that’s a little  more informal; “far too modest”

is a little more formal.  Fumi says, “And soon, I w on’t be the only one who thinks so (who thinks that you are an unsung hero).”

Issac says, “What are you proposing to do?”  “To pr opose” means to suggest or to present an idea for what you think should be don e and how it should be done. Fumi says, “Don’t worry.  I’m not planning a ticker -tape parade, but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are arou nd here!”  A “ticker tape” is a long piece of paper, usually in a roll, that is use d in a ticker tape machine, which is like a teletype or telegraph machine.  It was a way of conveying messages electronically, over the radio, and it was a specia l machine that converted the radio signals into something that would then produc e either typing or some sort of printing that you would be able to send informat ion over a long distance.  They were very popular in the old days, many years ago, for those that were involved in the New York and other stock exchanges.  When yo u’re done with the ticker tape you can cut it up and use it as “confetti,” wh ich are small, little pieces of paper that you cut up and then you throw on someone  as a way of congratulating them.  And, in New York City, when someone did some thing wonderful, the tradition was to give that person or those people a  “ticker-tape parade,” meaning they would take the tape – the pieces paper – rip t hem up, and throw them from the tall buildings in New York City so they would c ome down on the heroes that were being honored, sort of like rain falling down but it is paper.  In general, it’s used to indicate that you are going to have a big c elebration.  Fumi tells Issac that she’s not planning a ticker-tape parade, “but it’s time your contributions are recognized for what they are around here!”  “To rec ognize” means to realize that they are important.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Fumi:  You may have everyone else fooled, but I kno w the real reason for the success of this project.

Issac:  What?

Fumi:  You.  You’ve been working behind the scenes to bolster the people who weren’t up to the task.  Without you, this project would have been sunk months ago.

Issac:  That’s nonsense.

Fumi:  No, it’s not.  I know you don’t like the lim elight, but you were the linchpin of this operation.  Without you, we’d all have egg on our faces today.

Issac:  You’re giving me way too much credit.  I do n’t want to hear another word about it.

Fumi:  I’m not surprised at your reaction.  Most un sung heroes like to keep a low profile.

Issac:  What?!  I’m nothing of the kind!

Fumi:  Yes, you are.  You’re far too modest.  And s oon, I won’t be the only one who thinks so!

Issac:  What are you proposing to do?

[start of dialogue]

Jim:  You know that religion is a taboo subject, es pecially with Paul.  Why were you baiting him all through dinner?

Tammy:  I wasn’t baiting him.  We have very differe nt views on spirituality and I wanted to discuss the subject with him.

Jim:  You were making disparaging remarks about his  faith and some of the things he holds most sacred.  I think you were tryi ng to be provocative.

Tammy:  I may have said a few things that were prov ocative, but I don’t understand how people can believe in superstitions.

Jim:  There you go again!  People’s religious belie fs shouldn’t be called superstitions.

Tammy:  I’m just calling it like I see it.  I didn’ t know you were such a fundamentalist.

Jim:  I’m not a fundamentalist.  In fact, I’m an at heist, or at least an agnostic, but I still try to show respect for other people’s belief s.

Tammy:  Beliefs are made to be challenged.  If you can’t defend your beliefs, you shouldn’t have them.

Jim:  Ladies and gentlemen, behold the voice of tol erance.

 [end of dialogue]

It’s commonly accepted by most Americans that if yo u are among strangers – among people you don’t know – you don’t typically d iscuss politics or religion. But that’s not what happened in our dialogue.  Jim says to Tammy, “You know that religion is a taboo subject, especially with P aul.”  “Religion,” of course, refers to a system of belief, a system of practices about how to run your life.  It usually involves certain ceremonies, what we would call “ri tuals,” that are connected with it.  Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism; all of  these could be considered religions.  A “taboo” (taboo) here means something that is unacceptable in a particular culture or society; it’s something that you don’t talk about because it is considered so evil or so bad or so controversial.  Jim asks, “Why were you baiting him (baiting Paul) all through dinner?”  “T o bait (bait) (someone)” is to say certain things in order to get a strong reaction fr om that person, often to make them angry, to say something you know will make the m angry.  “Bait,” as a noun, is what you use to try to catch fish.  You put the bait on the end of a long string that you put down into the water, and the fish come s and gets the bait – the food – and then you pull on the string – on the line, the fishing line – in order to catch the fish.  That’s where that expression comes from.

Tammy says, “I wasn’t baiting him.  We have very di fferent views on spirituality and I wanted to discuss the subject with him.”  “Sp irituality” is a more general term used to talk about one’s interest in and belie fs about the meaning of life, the meaning of religion.  Nowadays, depending on where you see it, it often refers to what we might call “alternative” religious experien ces, those that are not part of the more popular religions such as Christianity, Ju daism, Islam, and so forth.  But it can also be used to describe someone in a partic ular religion, their particular beliefs and ideas about something.

Jim then says, “You were making disparaging remarks  about his faith.”  “To make disparaging remarks” means to say something to show  that you don’t think something else is good, you don’t think it’s import ant, to say bad things about another person or another idea that you don’t like.   A “remark” is simply a comment, something you say.  “Disparaging” means to  criticize it, to say it is bad or wrong.  Jim says Tammy was making disparaging re marks about Paul’s faith. “Faith” here means simply his belief in something.  He says that she was making disparaging remarks about some of the things that P aul holds most sacred. “Sacred” (sacred) here means holy, related to God, related to religion.  He “holds them sacred,” that’s just the expression we use.  W e use the verb “hold” meaning he has these beliefs, he believes these things are holy, that you shouldn’t criticize them or make fun of them.  Jim then says to Tammy, “I think you were

trying to be provocative.”  “To be provocative” mea ns to do something that makes other people upset, it might even make them angry.  It definitely is something that produces a strong reaction.  Sometimes it can be us ed in a sexual sense; if someone says, “That dress is very provocative,” the y mean that it is sexy, that it produces a certain reaction in the people who see i t, not always positive.

Tammy says, “I may have said a few things that were  provocative, but I don’t understand how people can believe in superstitions. ”  “Superstition” (superstition) is a belief in things that are lucky or not lucky.  So for example, some people have a rabbit’s foot – at least they used to, I don ’t know if they sell rabbits’ feet anymore.  But when I was a child you could buy a ra bbit’s foot, and this was considered a lucky object; it was actually called a  lucky “charm” (charm).  This is much closer to the idea of magic, where if you do s omething, something will happen automatically, no question about it.

Tammy is saying that Paul is someone who believes i n superstitions.  Jim says, “There you go again!”  “There you go again” is a ph rase used to emphasize that you have just done exactly what you were denying or  promising not to do again. The phrase was made famous back in a political deba te in 1980 between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.  When Carter made some sta tement, Reagan turned to him and said, “There you go again Mr. President, ” something like that.  But in more general terms, it just means that you are sayi ng to the person you are doing whatever they said they weren’t going to do a gain.

Jim says, “People’s religious beliefs shouldn’t be called superstitions.”  Tammy says, “I’m just calling it like I see it.”  The phr ase “to call (something) like you see it” means that you are giving your true opinion, an d you’re not worried about what other people are going to think or say.  You’re not  worried about making other people angry or not, you’re simply describing the s ituation as you perceive it – as you see it.  Tammy is a little confused since super stition and magic are based on the idea that if you do certain things, as I mentio ned earlier, other things will happen.  If you say certain words certain results a re guaranteed, if you will.  So God, or the gods, or some higher power doesn’t real ly have a choice.  In religion it’s somewhat the opposite; most religions believe that there are certain things you should do, but that God or the higher power is the one who’s in control, not you.  But Tammy knows that this is considered an in sulting term, really, for people who are religious, and so she uses that term  “superstitious,” or “superstitions.”  Then she says, “I didn’t know you  (Jim) were such a fundamentalist.”  Once again, the word “fundamental ist” is one that is sometimes used as an insult, not in all cases.  A “fundamenta list” would be someone who follows religious laws very strictly, does everythi ng they’re supposed to do, and believes in every aspect of the religion.  In the U nited States it has other

meanings, more technical if you will, but we won’t go into those here.  Tammy is really using the word as an insult in a general sen se, without perhaps understanding exactly the technical differences in what fundamentalism really means.

Jim says, “I’m not a fundamentalist.  In fact,” Jim  says, “I’m an atheist, or at least an agnostic.”  An “atheist” is a person who does no t believe in God or in gods. It’s a person who denies the existence of a higher power of a god.  An “agnostic” (agnostic) is a person who says that they don’t kno w whether God exists or not, a person who believes that it isn’t possible, perhaps , to know that God exists.  So Jim is also confused; he’s not sure if he’s an athe ist or an agnostic.  He says, however, “I still try to show respect for other peo ple’s beliefs.  Tammy says, “Beliefs (things that you believe in) are made to b e challenged (are made to be defended).”  In fact, she says, “If you can’t defen d your beliefs, you shouldn’t have them.”  “To defend” means to protect something  or someone from someone else who’s attacking them; to say or do things, in this case, to show that what you believe is true and you have good reasons for belie ving that.

Jim then makes a joke; he says, “Ladies and gentlem en, behold the voice of tolerance.”  “Ladies and gentlemen” is what you say  when you are talking to a large group of people and trying to get their atten tion – trying to get them to listen to you.  Here, though, it’s just Tammy and Jim, so he’s joking.  He says, “behold the voice of tolerance.”  “Behold” (behold) is a ve ry formal word that means to draw attention to something.  Nowadays it’s used mo re as a joke; it’s not used in the way that it perhaps used to be used.  So Jim is  saying “everyone look at this person.”  He calls Tammy “the voice of tolerance.”  “The voice of…” means that she is speaking as if she were that person.  But th is isn’t a real person, this is an idea that she is apparently speaking for, and that idea is tolerance (tolerance). “Tolerance” is a willingness to let other people do , say, and believe what they want to without feeling like you have to criticize them or change them.  It’s allowing other people to be what they want to be.  Jim is making a joke; he’s saying that, in fact, Tammy is not a voice of toler ance, that by criticizing Paul she, in fact, is being intolerant, not allowing people t o believe what they want to, in a sense.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jim:  You know that religion is a taboo subject, es pecially with Paul.  Why were you baiting him all through dinner?

Tammy:  I wasn’t baiting him.  We have very differe nt views on spirituality and I wanted to discuss the subject with him.

Jim:  You were making disparaging remarks about his  faith and some of the things he holds most sacred.  I think you were tryi ng to be provocative.

Tammy:  I may have said a few things that were prov ocative, but I don’t understand how people can believe in superstitions.

# Minor Medical Injuries

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 682: Minor Medical Injuries.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 682.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode and all of our current episodes.

This episode is called “Minor Medical Injuries.”  I t’s a dialogue between Cherise and Evan using vocabulary about ways that you may b e hurt, but not seriously. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cherise:  Rise and shine!  Isn’t it a lovely day?  I love getting back to nature. There’s nothing like going camping.  How did you sl eep?

Evan:  That was the most miserable night of my life !

Cherise:  Really?  What happened?

Evan:  I woke up in the middle of the night and tho ught I heard a bear.  I got up, stubbed my toe, and tripped.  I have scratches all over my arms, not to mention these bruises on my legs.  See?

Cherise:  Oh, don’t you know that there aren’t any bears this late in the year?

Evan:  How should I have known that?  This was my f irst time camping.

Cherise:  All right.  Why are you holding your neck  like that?

Evan:  I couldn’t get comfortable at all sleeping o n the ground.  I woke up with a crick in my neck.

Cherise:  Stop moving around like that or you’ll re ally hurt yourself.

Evan:  Oh, I have a cramp in my shoulder!  It hurts !

Cherise:  I told you not to twist around like that.   Just let it work itself out.

Evan:  All of this had to happen to me after gettin g a stitch in my side and a charley horse hiking five miles yesterday.  I’ve ha d it!  I’m going back to civilization.

Cherise:  How are you getting there?

Evan:  What do you mean?  I’m walking.

Cherise:  Without food or water?  You’d better wait  for me or you may end up bear bait after all!

[end of dialogue]

Cherise begins by saying, “Rise and shine!  Isn’t i t a lovely day?”  The expression “rise (rise) and shine (shine)” is a way of saying wake up, it’s time to get up.  It was probably more popular among an older generation , but you’ll still hear it sometimes in order to make a joke.  Cherise says, “ Isn’t it a lovely day (isn’t it a beautiful day)?” meaning it is a beautiful day.  Sh e says, “I love getting back to nature.”  The expression “to get back to nature” me ans to spend time outdoors, away from a building or a house, in order to experi ence this feeling of being in the natural world, maybe by a lake or a river or tr ees.  Cherise says, “There’s nothing like going camping,” and now we understand why she says that, because they are camping.  “To go camping” means to spend t ime outdoors, usually sleeping outdoors, sleeping perhaps in what we woul d call a “sleeping bag,” which is like a blanket in the form of a big bag th at you put yourself into to keep yourself warm.  For some additional information on this word “camp” go to our Learning Guide and look under the section What Else  Does It Mean.

Cherise says to Evan, “How did you sleep?”  Evan sa ys, “That was the most miserable night of my life!”  “Miserable” (miserabl e) means very uncomfortable, very unpleasant; something you don’t want to do bec ause you suffered, it caused you some pain.  Cherise says, “Really?  What happen ed?” Evan says, “I woke up in the middle of the night (that is, after the time  that most people have fallen asleep) and thought I heard a bear (a large brown o r black animal typically, at least in the United States).  I got up, stubbed my toe, and tripped.”  So, Evan got up, he got up off the ground presumably, we’re gues sing, and stubbed his toe. “To stub (stub) your toe” means to hit your foot ag ainst something by accident, causing pain in one of your 10 toes that are on you r feet.  It’s not a serious accident – you don’t break any bones, for example –  but it can hurt.  In Evan’s case, it caused him to trip (trip).  “To trip” mean s to fall or almost fall when you hit

something, usually with your feet.  Evan says, “I h ave scratches all over my arms, not to mention these bruises on my legs.”  A “scratch” is a long, thin cut on your skin; a little blood comes out but not very mu ch.  A “bruise” (bruise) is a large area on your skin that becomes blue or brown or purple, usually because you hit that part of your body against something, o r someone hit you.  So, Evan says that he has scratches – cuts – all over his ar ms, “not to mention these bruises on my legs,” he says.  “Not to mention” mea ns in addition I also have this.  He has bruises on his legs.  “See?” he says to Cherise.

Cherise says, “Oh, don’t you know that there aren’t  any bears this late in the year?”  Evan says, “How should I have known that?” meaning I had no way of knowing that, because, he says, “This was my first time camping,” the first time that he went camping.  Cherise says, “All right.  W hy are you holding your neck like that?”  Evan is holding onto his neck with his  hand; he says, “I couldn’t get comfortable at all sleeping on the ground.”  “At al l” here is used for emphasis, meaning I wasn’t able to get comfortable in any way  by sleeping on the ground. Now, I have to agree with Evan.  I have gone campin g when I was a younger man.  I’ve gone camping where we just had a sleepin g bag on the ground, in the middle of a forest.  It was probably the worst coup le of days I have ever had!  I am not a camping kind of person, in fact I think yo u can divide the world into campers and non-campers, and campers should never m arry non-campers. Fortunately, I’m a non-camper and so is my wife.  I  can camp if I’m in like a truck, where I have a regular bed; that’s okay.  Camping o n the ground, I’ll leave that to the rest of you, meaning I’ll let you guys have fun  doing that while I’m sitting in my hotel.

Evan doesn’t like camping, at least he hasn’t had a  good experience of it; he fell down, he didn’t sleep well, his neck hurts.  Evan s ays, “I woke up with a crick in my neck.”  A “crick (crick) in your neck” is when y ou have a muscle pain on the side of your neck, sometimes caused by the way that  you were sleeping, and it prevents you from turning your head from left to ri ght very easily.  If you’re sleeping on the ground without a nice pillow, well then, that may give you a crick in the neck.

Cherise says, “Stop moving around like that or you’ ll really hurt yourself.”  We’re not sure what Evan is doing here, probably moving h is neck.  Evan says, “Oh, I have a cramp in my shoulder!  It hurts!”  A “cramp”  (cramp) is a sharp feeling of pain, usually caused by a muscle that won’t relax p roperly.  If you are running or doing some sort of athletic event sometimes you wil l get cramps; your body will produce a sharp pain in the muscle.  It could happe n in your arms, it could happen in your legs; this happened to Evan’s should er.

Cherise says, “I told you not to twist like that.”  “To twist” means to turn or rotate something in a particular direction.  You can find other meanings of the word “twist” in our Learning Guide for this episode.  Ch erise says, “Just let it work itself out.”  The expression “to work itself out” means to  have a problem fix itself; when something bad happens sometimes it will get better even if you don’t do anything, and that’s what Cherise is telling Evan t o do.

Evan says, “All of this had to happen to me after g etting a stitch in my side and a charley horse hiking five miles yesterday.”  A “sti tch (stitch) in your side” is a pain that you feel on one side of your body, usually bet ween your hip or your waist and your arms.  It’s often caused by doing too much  physical activity, often running is the problem.  A “charley horse” (charley ) horse (two words) is another word for a cramp, a painful cramp typically in your  leg.  Evan says, “I’ve had it!” meaning I’m very tired and frustrated about somethi ng and I don’t want to do it anymore.  Evan doesn’t want to go camping anymore.  He says, “I’m going back to civilization.”  “Civilization” can mean a partic ular society over many years that follow similar rules and customs.  In this case, it ’s really used to indicate somewhere that is not outdoors: a city, a town wher e there are buildings and hotels and restaurants, a place that has modern com forts and conveniences available.

Cherise says, “How are you getting there?” meaning how are you going to get from where they are now to civilization, as Evan ca lls it.  Evan says, “What do you mean?  I’m walking.”  Cherise says, “Without fo od or water?”  She says, “You better wait for me.”  She’s giving him some ad vice: you should wait for me to go with you.  “Or,” she says, “you may end up be ar bait after all!”  “You may end up” means that the final result might be that y ou are bear (like the animal) bait (bait).  “Bait” is a small piece of food that’ s used to attract an animal, usually so that you can catch it.  You put the bait in some thing called a “trap,” and the animal comes to get the bait, and when it moves the  food the trap comes down on the animal to capture it – to keep it there, usu ally because you’re trying to get rid of it.  The most common trap that most people a re familiar with would be a mousetrap, trying to rid of mice that are in your h ouse.  The traditional bait for that is cheese – because everyone knows that mice l ove cheese!  Cherise is saying that Evan, if he’s not careful, may fall dow n, get injured, and become bait for a bear – the bear might eat him.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cherise:  Rise and shine!  Isn’t it a lovely day?  I love getting back to nature. There’s nothing like going camping.  How did you sl eep?

Evan:  That was the most miserable night of my life !

Cherise:  Really?  What happened?

# Using a Video-Sharing Website

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 683: Using a Video-Sharing Website.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 683.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website, you know, it’s eslpod.com.  Go there, you know what to do.

This episode is called “Using a Video-Sharing Websi te.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Melissa:  You’re looking at the next overnight sens ation.  I’m uploading my video right now, and by this time tomorrow, I wouldn’t be  surprised if it’s had over 100,000 views.  It’s going to go viral.

Frank:  You and your amateur videos.  Who is going to watch something with such low production value?

Melissa:  You’d be surprised.  I have my own channe l on YouGube, with over 5,000 subscribers.

Frank:  Are you sure that’s not because your userna me is AngelinaJolie?

Melissa:  No, it’s because people enjoy my videos, mark them as their favorites, and share them with their friends.  Word of mouth –  that’s why I’m so popular.

Frank:  But what about the comments on your videos?   How many of those are positive and how many are negative?

Melissa:  I don’t read the comments.  I assume they ’re all positive, and my videos have never been flagged.

Frank:  All right, so is this another video of you dancing with your cat?

Melissa:  No, my cat and I are dancing and singing.   That’s why we’re both going to be the next big thing.

Frank:  Right, I’ll get in line right now to buy ti ckets to your upcoming Vegas show.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Melissa saying to Frank, “ You’re looking at the next overnight sensation.”  “Overnight” (one word) means  from today till tomorrow, in 24 hours.  If a company says we’ll deliver that to you overnight that means it will be there the next day.  “Overnight,” however, can a lso mean very quickly, suddenly.  This is the meaning that Melissa has in mind when she says “the next overnight sensation.”  A “sensation” here means som ething that is very popular; something that has become very popular very quickly  is called an “overnight sensation.”  Melissa says, “I’m uploading my video right now.”  “To upload” (upload – one word) means to move a file from a com puter – a computer’s hard drive – up to another computer on the Internet or o n a network of computers. Melissa says that by this time tomorrow, in 24 hour s, “I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s had over 100,000 views.”  She’s saying that sh e expects that her video will, in 24 hours, have 100,000 views.  A “view,” when we’re  talking about a video website, means that something has been watched by 1 00,000 people or 100,000 times.  Maybe one person watches it 100,000 times; I’m not sure exactly how that works.  But, 100,000 views usually means that 100,000 people have seen the video.  “It’s going to go viral,” Melissa says.   The expression “to go viral” (viral) means something becomes very popular on the  Internet very quickly.  Like a virus causes illness – sickness to spread quickly  from one person to another, “viral” means something moves very quickly on the I nternet; it becomes popular very quickly.

Frank says, “You and your amateur videos.”  “Amateu r” is the opposite of “professional,” something done by someone who isn’t  getting any money for it typically.  Also, it means not very good, not very sophisticated.  That’s the idea that Frank is saying; he’s saying that you are maki ng another amateur video. “Who’s going to watch something with such low produ ction value?”  “Production value” is the quality of the video or the quality o f the movie.  It could be the sound, it could be the way it looks, the special ef fects.  All of these are part of the production value.  “Production” comes from the word  “produce,” meaning to make.  “Value,” here, is how good or bad it is.  It ’s a term you hear a lot in Los Angeles when people talk about movies and films: “p roduction value.”

Melissa says, “You’d be surprised.”  That expressio n “you’d be surprised” means you will be surprised at the quality of my video.  She says, “I have my own channel on YouGube, with over 5,000 subscribers.”  A “channel” here is a group of things that are related to each other; it typica lly refers to something on the

radio or the television that is created and can be found in the same place every time.  On video-sharing sites, this one is called “ YouGube,” similar I think to YouTube, you can have your own channel.  So, you ca n put all of your videos in one place and people can find them easily.  They ca n also “subscribe” to your channel, meaning every time you put a new video on your channel they get an email telling you hey, there’s a new video on this person’s channel.  A “subscriber” is someone who has signed up or paid t o receive copies of something such as a newspaper, a magazine, or in th is case emails on the Internet.  Notice when pronounced quickly, the word  “Internet” often loses that “t” in the middle when we say it quickly: “ Inernet ” instead of “Internet.”

Anyway, Frank says, “Are you sure that’s not becaus e your username is AngelinaJolie?”  A “username” (one word) is a name that you select for an email account or when you register or subscribe to someth ing on the Internet.  It’s a name that you can pick that doesn’t necessarily hav e to be your name.  One of my usernames is ESLPod; that’s not my name, but I c an use it as my username. That’s my username on Twitter; you can follow me on  Twitter if you want to. Frank says Melissa has a username of AngelinaJolie,  who you may know is a famous, beautiful actress who lives with another ac tor, some guy by the name of Brad…Brad…what is it?  Brad Pitt, yeah, Brad Pitt.  Who ever heard of him?

Anyway, AngelinaJolie is the username Melissa uses,  and of course people would subscribe to her channel thinking that she wa s the real Angelina Jolie. Melissa says, however, “No,” that isn’t true.  She has 5,000 subscribers she says, “because people enjoy my videos, mark them as  their favorites, and share them with their friends.”  On many websites you can  indicate which things on the site are your favorite things, and that’s what Meli ssa is referring to.  People also share her videos; they send an email perhaps with a  “link” (the website address) so the person can then look at that video, or they put on their Facebook page or perhaps they put it on their Twitter feed by tweeti ng it.  Melissa says, “Word of mouth – that’s why I’m so popular.”  “Word of mouth ” is an expression that means that one person tells another person and then  they tell their friend and then that friend tells someone else, and pretty soo n you’re very popular because everyone has been telling everyone else.  Normally we use this expression to compare it to another way of getting people to come  to your website or go to your store, which would be a commercial on the televisio n for example, or in the newspaper.  But, “word of mouth” is advertising tha t takes place when one person tells another.  It doesn’t cost you any mone y; it’s the best kind of advertising.  Melissa says, “that’s why I’m so popu lar (that’s why everyone likes me).”

Frank says, “But what about the comments on your vi deos?”  A “comment” is something that you write to express your opinion, e specially on a website.  Frank asks, “How many of those (comments) are positive an d how many are negative?” Melissa says, “I don’t read the comments.  I assume  they’re all positive, and my videos have never been flagged.”  She thinks everyo ne loves her videos, but she doesn’t read their comments with their actual opini ons.  She says her videos have never been flagged.  “To be flagged” (flagged)  means to indicate that something on the Internet has either broken a rule for the website or is somehow unusual in some way.  So if you go to YouTube and y ou put up a video of a television program that is illegal, someone could f lag your video.  They could indicate to the owner of the website that you are d oing something wrong.

Frank says, “All right, so is this another video of  you dancing with your cat?” That’s Melissa’s video, her dancing with her cat.  Melissa says, “No, my cat and I are dancing and singing.  That’s why we’re both goi ng to be the next big thing.” “The next big thing” is the next thing that will be  very popular and well known among many people.  It’s the next, we might call it , “trend,” or “fad” (fad), something that’s popular for a while, but only brie fly – only for a short time, and then it’s not so popular.

Melissa says she thinks she and her cat will be the  next big thing.  Frank says, “Right,” but he says it in a way that really means wrong.  He says the word “right” meaning I don’t believe you.  So sometimes the mean ing of the word can be the opposite depending on how the person says it.  He s ays, “I’ll get in line (I’ll start waiting) right now to buy tickets to your upcoming Vegas show.”  “Upcoming” (one word) means happening in the near future, some thing that will be happening soon.  “Vegas” refers to the city of Las Vegas in N evada, about five hours by car east of Los Angeles.  It’s where you can go and see  a lot of famous singers, they have shows – they have performances that you go and  watch.  Frank, of course, is making a joke.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Melissa:  You’re looking at the next overnight sens ation.  I’m uploading my video right now, and by this time tomorrow, I wouldn’t be  surprised if it’s had over 100,000 views.  It’s going to go viral.

Frank:  You and your amateur videos.  Who is going to watch something with such low production value?

Melissa:  You’d be surprised.  I have my own channe l on YouGube, with over 5,000 subscribers.

Frank:  Are you sure that’s not because your userna me is AngelinaJolie?

Melissa:  No, it’s because people enjoy my videos, mark them as their favorites, and share them with their friends.  Word of mouth –  that’s why I’m so popular.

Frank:  But what about the comments on your videos?   How many of those are positive and how many are negative?

Melissa:  I don’t read the comments.  I assume they ’re all positive, and my videos have never been flagged.

Frank:  All right, so is this another video of you dancing with your cat?

Melissa:  No, my cat and I are dancing and singing.   That’s why we’re both going to be the next big thing.

Frank:  Right, I’ll get in line right now to buy ti ckets to your upcoming Vegas show.

[start of dialogue]

Amina:  What’s the lowdown on the new guy?

Earl:  Which new guy?

Amina:  You know, the cute one.  Fill me in.  Is he  single?

Earl:  I don’t know.  I have no idea.

Amina:  You’re working with him side-by-side and yo u haven’t gleaned any personal information about him?

Earl:  We talk about work.  It’s not my job to pry into his personal life.

Amina:  I need to get the scoop on Mr. Perfect and you’re my source.

Earl:  You don’t know anything about him, so how do  you know he’s perfect? Maybe when you get to know him, you’ll find out he’ s a selfish, self-centered jerk.

Amina:  Wait, catch me up on what’s going on here.  Have other people asked you about him?

Earl:  Yeah, maybe about a dozen of the women in th is office.  They’ve been bombarding me with questions.

Amina:  Oh, sorry.  I didn’t know.

Earl:  Yeah, I’m not the guy’s social secretary.  Y ou women have to satisfy your own curiosity elsewhere.

Amina:  Point taken, but do you know if he’s shown interest in any of the dozen women you’ve talked to?

Earl:  Ugh!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Amina saying to Earl, “Wha t’s the lowdown on the new guy?”  The word “lowdown” (one word) means what is the interesting information about someone, what is the true information about t his person.  We often use this we are talking about perhaps secret information, in formation that you know and no one else knows.  Amina is asking for the lowdown  on the new guy, the new man who is working at their company.

Earl says, “Which new guy?”  Amina says, “You know,  the cute one.”  “Cute” is someone who is attractive – physically attractive.  I’m sort of the opposite of cute; I’m the anti-cute!  Anyway, Amina says, “Fill me in .”  “To fill (someone) in” is a phrasal verb meaning to give someone accurate infor mation about what she or he wants or needs.  “Fill me in” means give me the information I need.  She begins by asking, “Is he single?” meaning is he unm arried.  Earl says, “I don’t know.  I have no idea,” meaning I don’t have any in formation at all.  Amina says, “You’re working with him side-by-side (meaning righ t next to him physically) and you haven’t gleaned any personal information about him?”  “To glean” (glean) means to learn something or to find something out i ndirectly, without asking the person directly.  You get information, but not by a sking them.  You get it by doing other things, listening to their answers, asking re lated questions perhaps.  Earl says, “We talk about work,” meaning when he and the  new guy have a conversation it’s related to their work, not to the ir personal lives.  Earl then says, “It’s not my job to pry into his personal life.”  “ To pry” (pry) means, in this case, to ask personal questions, usually questions that are very private or that are about information that you would not normally ask someone .  Someone might tell you, “Don’t pry,” meaning don’t ask too personal of a qu estion, things that you really don’t have any right to know.  “To pry,” also, is t he verb we use when, for example, we’re trying to open a door that won’t ope n, and we take a piece of thin

metal – a long stick – and we try to open the door;  we try to pry it open.  It’s the same idea of trying to get into an area that is clo sed, much like your personal life might be closed.

Earl says that it’s not his job to pry into the new  guy’s personal life.  Amina says, “I need to get the scoop on Mr. Perfect and you’re my source.”  The “scoop” (scoop) in this case is the most important informat ion about something, especially information that is secret.  The word “s coop” can also be used as a verb.  In journalism, when talking about newspapers  for example, or magazines, “to get a scoop on (something),” or simply “to get a scoop,” means to get information about a story before anyone else does, before anyone else is able to write an article about it.  Here, the term is used more generally to mean information – important, possibly secret informatio n.  Amina calls him “Mr. Perfect,” meaning she really likes this person.  Sh e says to Earl, “you’re my source.”  “Source,” in this case, just like we were  talking about newspapers and magazines, is a person who provides information on a particular topic.  It’s a term often associated with journalism – with news report ing.  Your “source” is the person who tells you information, again, often secr et information.  Earl is Amina’s source for information, the place where she can go to get information.

Earl says, “You don’t know anything about him, so h ow do you know he’s perfect?  Maybe when you get to know him, you’ll fi nd out he’s a selfish, self- centered jerk.”  “To be selfish” (selfish) means to  care only about yourself and your happiness, you don’t care about anyone else.  “Self-centered” means something similar, you only think about yourself an d how something will affect you.  You don’t think about how something will have  an impact on or affect another person; that’s someone who is self-centered .  We might also use the word “narcissistic,” from the old Greek story of Na rcissus, the person who is so in love with themselves they don’t pay attention to an yone else.  This, some people say, is a problem that has gotten worse in the Unit ed States.  I read a book recently about this topic; I think it was called so mething like The Epidemic of Narcissism .  “Epidemic” is like a disease that spreads quickl y, and many people get the disease.  Well, that’s what some psychologi sts say is happening with narcissism, especially among younger Americans.  It  was an interesting book, but I really wish it would have talked more about m y generation.  I mean, they’re the most important, right?  So, Earl says that this  new guy could be a selfish, self-centered jerk.  A “jerk” (jerk) is a rude, unc aring, selfish, self-centered, thoughtless person that you don’t like.  It’s a ver y negative way to describe someone, an insulting term, informally used, not so mething you would ever, for example, want to say about your boss – at least if your boss is listening to you!  It can be used to describe a man or a woman, probably a little more common in describing a man.

 Amina says, “Wait, catch me up on what’s going on h ere.”  “To catch (someone) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to give some one the information that he or she needs in order to know as much as everyone e lse knows about a certain topic.  The idea is that other people know more tha n you do about this.  Maybe you were on vacation or you were gone, and now you want someone to catch you up, to give you information that everyone else already has.  There are some other meanings of this verb that you can find in ou r Learning Guide for this episode.

Amina says, “Have other people asked you about him? ”  Earl says, “Yeah, maybe about a dozen of the women in this office.”  So, a “dozen,” around 12 other women have also asked Earl for information ab out this new, apparently cute guy.  Earl says, “They’ve been bombarding me w ith questions.”  “To bombard (bombard) (someone)” in this case means to ask them many questions very quickly: “Where is he going?  What does he loo k like?  How old is he?  Is he married?  Does he hate cats?”  All important questi ons, right?  That would be to bombard someone with questions.  We also use this v erb when talking about airplanes that are dropping bombs on a place in ord er to blow things up – to destroy things.  So, that’s the original military m eaning of “bombard.”

Earl says that the other women have been bombarding  him with questions. Amina says, “Oh, sorry.  I didn’t know.”  Earl then  says, “Yeah, I’m not the guy’s social secretary.”  A “social secretary” would be a  person who schedules another person’s personal meetings and dates, not a profess ional secretary that you would have at an office.  Some people are so busy a nd have so much money that they can have a personal and a business or pro fessional secretary.  I don’t have either one, but I don’t really need the social  secretary.  My life is very boring, anyway.  Anyway, enough about me.  Earl say s that you women have to satisfy your own curiosity elsewhere.  “To satisfy your own curiosity,” or simply “to satisfy your curiosity,” means to find the answ ers to the questions you have by yourself.  To discover things you want to know w ithout getting help from other people, that would be to satisfy your own curiosity .

Amina says, “Point taken.”  This is an informal phr ase we use to mean that you understand and agree with the other person on what they just said.  “Point taken,” Amina then says, “but do you know if he’s s hown interest in any of the dozen women you’ve talked to?”  So, she asks anothe r question, even after Earl says he doesn’t want to answer more questions.  Her  question is has the new guy shown interest in any of the other women who ha ve been asking about him. “To show interest in” is to be interested in someon e or something.  Often, we use it to describe someone who is interested in a roman tic relationship with another

person.  They may show interest by talking to them,  laughing at their jokes, asking them to go to lunch with them, and so forth.   Earl replies simply by saying, “Ugh!”  This is an expression of frustration, of di sappointment, of dislike.  He doesn’t want to be asked these questions; he’s tire d of it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Amina:  What’s the lowdown on the new guy?

Earl:  Which new guy?

Amina:  You know, the cute one.  Fill me in.  Is he  single?

Earl:  I don’t know.  I have no idea.

Amina:  You’re working with him side-by-side and yo u haven’t gleaned any personal information about him?

Earl:  We talk about work.  It’s not my job to pry into his personal life.

Amina:  I need to get the scoop on Mr. Perfect and you’re my source.

Earl:  You don’t know anything about him, so how do  you know he’s perfect? Maybe when you get to know him, you’ll find out he’ s a selfish, self-centered jerk.

Amina:  Wait, catch me up on what’s going on here.  Have other people asked you about him?

Earl:  Yeah, maybe about a dozen of the women in th is office.  They’ve been bombarding me with questions.

Amina:  Oh, sorry.  I didn’t know.

Earl:  Yeah, I’m not the guy’s social secretary.  Y ou women have to satisfy your own curiosity elsewhere.

Amina:  Point taken, but do you know if he’s shown interest in any of the dozen women you’ve talked to?

Earl:  Ugh!

# Getting Feedback on Writing

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 685: Getting Feedback on Writing.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 685.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  The Learning Guide helps you improve your  English and helps us keep this podcast audio free for everyone.

This episode is called “Getting Feedback on Writing ,” getting someone’s reaction to, comments on, and corrections on your writing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Xica:  I just got my paper back from Professor Rodr iguez and it’s all marked up.

Lucas:  Let me see.  It doesn’t look too bad.  This  is a draft, right?  His note at the top says to make revisions before handing in a fina l version.  He’s trying to help you get a better grade.

Xica:  Maybe, but there’s nothing he likes about the essay.  Look at all of those comments in the margins.  He underlined the entire introduction and wrote “run- on sentence” next to it.

Lucas:  That’s easy to fix, and it is a run-on sent ence, you know.

Xica:  And in the body, he wrote that I had no tran sitions and that my arguments weren’t well supported.

Lucas:  Well, transitions are easy to put in and yo u just need to cite a few more sources – that’s all.

Xica:  Yeah, but that’s not all.  Next to the concl usion, he wrote that I didn’t properly summarize my main points.  See what I mean ?  There’s nothing he likes about this essay.

Lucas:  I think you should take the constructive cr iticism as it’s meant – to help you.

 Xica:  It’s easy for you to say.  You’re done with college.  It’s kind of demoralizing to get your paper back all marked up.

Lucas:  True, but you forget that I have my own bat tle wounds – lots of them!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Xica saying to Lucas, “I j ust got my paper back from Professor Rodriguez and it’s all marked up.”  A “pa per,” in this case, is something you would give to a teacher or professor in school,  some writing that you had to do, maybe an essay.  Xica has received her paper ba ck from Professor Rodriguez.  She gave it to Professor Rodriguez and Rodriguez gave it back to her all marked up.  “To be marked up” means that it  has been corrected, edited, perhaps changed.  Usually the teacher or professor will use a red pen, and they will circle things and write things there, and indi cate how it needs be corrected or changed.

Lucas says, “Let me see.  It doesn’t look too bad.  This is a draft, right?”  A “draft” is the first attempt or one of your first attempts to write a certain paper or document.  Usually, the draft has be changed, corre cted, and reviewed.  So, when someone says, “This paper is just a draft,” th ey mean it still isn’t perfect yet.  Lucas says that his, meaning Professor Rodrig uez, note at the top of the paper says to make revisions before handing in a fi nal version.  “Revisions” are changes to what you have written, changes to the pa per or document to make it better.  “To hand in” means to give to, in this cas e, the professor.  “Hand in” is the phrasal verb we often use in school to talk about t hings that you are giving to the professor or the teacher as a student, but it also could be used in other circumstances.

Lucas says, “He (the professor) is trying to help y ou get a better grade (a better mark on your paper).”  Xica says, “Maybe, but there ’s nothing he likes about the essay.  Look at all of those comments in the margin s.”  “Comments” are, in this case, someone’s opinion about something or addition al information that they want you to think about and perhaps use in making y our revisions.  There are other meanings of the word “comment,” and those can  be found in our Learning Guide.  A “margin” (margin), when talking about a p iece of paper, is the space at the top, bottom, right or left sides of the page; t hey are often white, but not always.  The margin is where you could write commen ts on someone’s writing. It’s space that is not usually written in.  “Margin ” has a couple of different meanings in English and those, once again, can be f ound in our wonderful Learning Guide.  Xica says that the professor under lined the entire introduction

and wrote (quote) “run-on sentence” (unquote) next to it.  “To underline” is to draw a thin, small line below the text, underneath the writing, often to emphasize or point out something.  The “introduction” is the first part of the paper; in this case it was an essay.  The introduction usually tel ls you what the essay is going to be about.  Xica says that the professor underlin ed the entire introduction and wrote “run-on sentence.”  A “run-on sentence” is a sentence that is very long, often one the uses the word “and,” “or,” or another  conjunction too many times so the sentence keeps going and going and going.  Usua lly, a run-on sentence is one where you can put a period in; you can break the sentence up and it will make more sense or read more easily.  A run-on sent ence, in other words, is not something you want to have, and that’s what the pro fessor is telling poor Xica.

Lucas says, “That’s easy to fix (that’s easy to cor rect), and it is a run-on sentence, you know.”  He’s agreeing with the profes sor that Xica’s first sentence or the introduction is a run-on sentence.  Xica the n says, “And in the body, he wrote that I had no transitions and that my argumen ts weren’t well supported.” The “body,” when we’re talking about an essay, a do cument like this, is the main part of the essay; it’s the main part of the docume nt.  You have an introduction, a body, and a conclusion.  So it’s the longest, typic ally, part of the essay, where you present the main points you are making and any evidence to support those points.  Xica says that in the body of her essay the professor wrote that she had no transitions.  A “transition” in writing is a wor d or short phrase that we use between sentences or between paragraphs that make t he writing smoother; they help you go from one point to the next point.  So, phrases like “in addition” and “nevertheless” and “however,” these could all be tr ansitional words or phrases. Xica says that the professor told her she had no tr ansitions and that her arguments weren’t well supported.  “Well supported”  means that you have a lot of evidence or proof for what you are saying.  You are  able to give facts that show that your conclusion is true.

Lucas says, “Well, transitions are easy to put in.”   It’s not difficult to put in the words and phrases so that the essay flows more smoo thly; you have phrases that take you from one part to the next.  He says, “you just need to cite a few more sources.”  In order for the essay to be well s upported is what he means. “To cite” (cite) means to refer to typically anothe r written document, maybe something in a book or a magazine that was said in order to support your own arguments.  It could be something that another expe rt said; it could be information that supports what you are trying to ar gue for.  So, Lucas says that in order to have a well supported argument, Xica just needs to put in – just needs to write in, to cite a few more sources.  “Source,” he re, is the book, the article, the interview where that particular piece of informatio n comes from.

Xica says, “Yeah, but that’s not all.  Next to the conclusion, he wrote that I didn’t properly summarize my main points.”  The “conclusio n” is the last, final part of an essay.  Remember, we have the introduction, the bod y, and now the conclusion. The conclusion of an essay usually summarizes your main points.  “To summarize” means to state the main ideas in a short  form, very quickly using just a couple of sentences.  Xica says, “See what I mean ?  There’s nothing he likes about this essay.”  So, the professor didn’t like t he introduction, he didn’t like the body, and he didn’t like the conclusion.

Lucas says, “I think you should take the constructi ve criticism as it’s meant – to help you.”  “Constructive criticism” is advice that  is meant to help someone improve something by showing them what is wrong wit h what they’re doing now. It’s “constructive” because you give it to the pers on in order to help them be better.  Of course, when you are “criticizing” some one, when you are telling them what they are doing wrong, they don’t always consid er that advice to be constructive, to be given to you in order to help y ou.  But, Lucas says that’s what Xica needs to do, that’s what the criticism is mean t to do, that’s the purpose of it.

So, Xica says, “It’s easy for you to say.”  That ex pression means that it’s easy for another person to tell you what to do because they don’t have to do it themselves.  Xica says, “You’re done with college ( meaning you’re finished with college, you are no longer in college – at the univ ersity).  It’s kind of demoralizing to get your paper back all marked up.”  “Demoralizi ng” is something that is depressing, something that is frustrating, somethin g that makes you feel like you’re not very good and will never be very good at  this action – this activity, in Xica’s case writing an essay.  She found the profes sor’s comments demoralizing.

Lucas says, “True (it can be demoralizing), but you  forget that I have my own battle wounds – lots of them!”  A “battle” is when two groups of people are fighting each other, perhaps two different countrie s.  A “wound” (wound) is when you are hurt; perhaps you have been shot or you hav e been cut.  A “battle wound,” then, is some injury that you have received  in a battle.  Lucas is using the expression here to mean that he has also receiv ed a lot of criticism.  He received difficult comments from professors when he  was in school so that he also knows what it is like to get these kinds of co mments, and that Xica’s experience is not unique.  She’s not the only one, he also has gone through this experience.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Xica:  I just got my paper back from Professor Rodr iguez and it’s all marked up.

Lucas:  Let me see.  It doesn’t look too bad.  This  is a draft, right?  His note at the top says to make revisions before handing in a fina l version.  He’s trying to help you get a better grade.

Xica:  Maybe, but there’s nothing he likes about the essay.  Look at all of those comments in the margins.  He underlined the entire introduction and wrote “run- on sentence” next to it.

Go there and download a Learning Guide today.  This episode is called “Roles Within a Family.”  It’s a dialogue between Larissa and Vince talking about different vocabulary related to people in your family.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Larissa:  I’m really nervous about meeting your family.  Vince:  You don’t need to be.  They’ll love you and you’ll fit right in.  Larissa:  Okay, but I want to make sure I know everyone I’ll be meeting.  Your Grandmother Celine is the matriarch of the family and your Uncle Nick is the black sheep of the family, is that right?  Vince:  That’s right, but none of us let on that Uncle Nick is considered the prodigal son.  He was really rebellious when he was young and left home when he was 17.  He came back 15 years later, but nobody really knows what happened during that time.  He’s always been a little eccentric.  Larissa:  I’ll be sure to steer clear of Uncle Nick, in that case.  Let’s see, you told me that he is the oldest and your Aunt Sue is the baby of the family.  Where does your Aunt Lily come in?    Vince:  She’s the middle child and is always the scapegoat for anything that goes wrong.  At least that’s what my grandfather has told me all these years.  Larissa:  That’s your Grandfather Albert, the patriarch of the family, right?  Vince:  Yes, you’ve got it.  I’m impressed you remembered so much about my family. # Shopping for a Television

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 687: Shopping for a Television.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 687.

This episode is all about buying a new television, with the vocabulary related, of course, to TVs.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Byung:  This is what I’m talking about!  It’s time to upgrade to a big-screen TV and this is the perfect place to buy one.  Nelly:  They certainly have a large selection.  These new TVs have pictures that are much sharper than our current one.  Byung:  There’s no comparison.  These new TVs have a much better resolution.  Just look at the brightness and the contrast!  Our old TV looks washed out by comparison.  Nelly:  And listen to that sound quality.  It’s like being in a movie theater with surround sound.  Byung:  Yeah, it’s time we moved into the 21st century.  Nelly:  According to what I’ve read, with a viewing distance of 10 feet, we should look for a screen size of about 40 inches.  Byung:  I was thinking more like a 60-inch screen.  Nelly:  A 60-inch TV?!  That would take up the entire living room wall.    Byung:  That’s exactly what I had in mind! # Ending a Business Relationship

On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue between Jerry and Camila about what happens when two companies or two people decide to end their business partnership or relationship.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Jerry:  Who’s going to break the news to Tech Experts?  Camila:  You mean about pulling the plug on using their services?  Jerry:  Yeah, the contract we signed with them last year is almost up, and as we decided last month, we’ll be going with another company.  Camila:  I think we should hold off on telling them until after all of our current projects are done.  We still have two more in the hopper.  Jerry:  Okay, but I don’t want to drag our feet in telling them, even if we’re not happy with their service.  As a professional courtesy, we should let them know soon.  Camila:  That may be true with other companies, but Tech Experts has really let us down this past year.  If we didn’t have an airtight contract with them, we would have switched companies long ago.  Jerry:  Well, maybe they’ll learn from their mistakes.  After all, they’ve been in business a long time. # Listening to a Political Speech

[start of dialogue]  Kylie:  Can you understand a word he’s saying?    Ramis:  I doubt if anyone can.  He’s talking out of both sides of his mouth.  First he says he’s fighting for the little guy, and then he says he’s a champion for businesses.    Kylie:  I thought he’d be different, but he’s just like any other politician.  Ramis:  He looks sincere and he sounds sincere, but when you actually listen to what he says, it’s nothing but double-talk.    Kylie:  You’ve got that right.  I wouldn’t trust him any farther than I could throw him.  Now what is he saying?  Ramis:  He says that he can cut taxes and increase government services.  Now how do you suppose he could pull that off?    Kylie:  He can’t.  These are just campaign promises.  Once he gets into office, he’ll renege on every one of those promises.    Ramis:  Year after year it’s the same thing – broken promises and the same old same old.  Why do we put up with it? # Types of Views

This episode is called “Types of Views.”  “Views,” here, refers to what you can see out your window from a home or hotel room.  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Andrea:  Help me decide on which type of hotel room  to book.

George:  I want the one with a bed.

Andrea:  Very funny.  We have a choice of different  views, and each one is a different price.  For instance, a room with a city view is 175 dollars a night and a panoramic view is 275 dollars a night.

George:  275 dollars a night?!  That’s highway robb ery!

Andrea:  If you think that’s too steep, there are a  few other options.  We can get a courtyard room with no view for 120 dollars a night  or a room with an obstructed or peek-a-boo ocean views for 130 dollars a night.

George:  I don’t really care which type of room we get as long as we don’t end up with a room on the ground floor.  I don’t like havi ng people walking back and forth outside my window all night.

Andrea:  Okay, I can request a room on an upper flo or.  You really don’t have a preference?

George:  No, not really.

Andrea:  There is a penthouse room for 400 dollars a night.

 George:  What?!  For that price, I’d better get a v iew of the Eiffel Tower, the Parthenon, and the Great Wall of China!

[end of dialogue]

The dialogue begins with Andrea saying to George, “ Help me decide on which type of hotel room to book.”  “To book,” as a verb,  means to reserve, to make arrangements to have something done at a particular  date or time in the future. For example: “I book a hotel room,” meaning I am re serving that room; I am saying that I am going to use that room on a certai n date.

George says, “I want the one with a bed.”  He’s say ing that he wants a hotel room that has a bed in it.  George, of course, is t rying to be funny.  Andrea then says, “Very funny,” which here means that’s not ver y funny, you are joking when I am trying to be serious.  She says, “We have a choi ce of different views, and each one is a different price.”  “For instance,” sh e says, meaning for example, “a room with a city view is 175 dollars a night and a panoramic view is 275 dollars a night.”  A “city view” is a, in this case, hotel ro om that gives you a view of the buildings of the city.  If you ever go to New York City and you stay in Manhattan, the downtown area, you will have from any hotel roo m a city view.  That is, you will be able to see the lights of the city – of oth er buildings in the city.  A “panoramic view” is where you have the ability to s ee a very wide area, usually because you are high up in the building or you have  lots of windows around the room that allows you to see a much wider portion or  section of whatever it is you’re looking at.  That’s a “panoramic (panoramic)  view.”

George is surprised at the price; he says, “275 dol lars a night?!”  Notice “a night” here means per night or each night.  He says, “That ’s highway robbery!” “Robbery” is when someone steals something from you .  A “highway” is a road, usually one where you travel fast.  But the express ion “highway robbery” refers to previous times, where people traveled and it wasn’t  safe to travel; you might be robbed by someone as you were traveling down the ro ad.  That’s what George thinks the price of the hotel is; he says it’s “hig hway robbery,” meaning it is too expensive, it cost more than it should.

Andrea says, “If you think that’s too steep, there are a few other options.” “Steep” (steep) means very expensive here, at a ver y high price.  “Steep” has some other meanings as well; you can find those in the Learning Guide for this episode.  Andrea says, “We can get a courtyard room  with no view for 120 dollars a night.”  A “courtyard” (one word) is an o utdoor area that is completely surrounded by buildings.  Usually, a courtyard is s quare or rectangular.  There

are sometimes plant or trees inside the courtyard.  When you have a courtyard room, of course, you are looking just at other room s in the same building, so there really isn’t a view.  That’s why Andrea says,  “We can get a courtyard room with no view for 120 dollars a night.”  She says th ey could also get a room with obstructed or peek-a-boo ocean views for 130 dollar s a night.  “Obstructed” (obstructed) is blocked, not able to be seen becaus e something else is in the way.  In some theaters or stadiums there are things  in front of your seat that block your view, that do not allow you to see what is on the other side.  That would be an “obstructed view.”  “Peek-a-boo” (peek- a-boo) is actually a child’s game, or a game that an adult plays with a very you ng child or baby.  “Peek-a- boo” is when you hide yourself so that the child ca n’t see you, and then suddenly you put your head in a position where the child can  see you, and then back again.  And, small children often find this amusing ; they think it’s fun.  A “peek-a- boo view” would be a view that you would have somet imes and sometimes not. It’s a partial view of something, similar to obstru cted but not obstructed all the time.  Perhaps there is a tree in front of the wind ow, and when the wind blows you can see through, so sometimes you can see.  Thi s is a “peek-a-boo ocean view,” a view of the ocean or the sea, such as the Pacific or Atlantic.

George says, “I don’t really care which type of roo m we get as long as we don’t end up with a room on the ground floor.”  “To end u p with” means to get a particular thing after waiting or making an effort.   It’s a very broad, general expression that can be used in many different insta nces.  For example if you are selling something at your store, at the end of the day after many hours someone may say to you, “Well, how much did you end up with  today?” meaning after working those many hours how much money did you hav e.  The expression here refers to what will happen after Andrea makes the r eservation, after they travel to the hotel, once they get to their room.  What did t hey end up with?  What did they finally or ultimately get?  What George does not wa nt to end up with is a room on the ground floor.  And, in the U.S. the “ground flo or” is the first floor, the floor that is the lowest in the building not including what is  below ground, the basement. George does not want a room on the ground floor.  H e says, “I don’t like having people walking back and forth outside my window all  night.”  “Back and forth” means going in two different directions repeatedly,  moving in one direction and then walking back in the other direction.  He’s say ing that he doesn’t want other people at the hotel walking by his window throughou t the night, as would be perhaps more common on the ground floor.  I’m not s ure if that’s true, but that’s what George thinks.

Andrea says, “Okay, I can request a room on an uppe r floor.”  “Upper,” here, would mean above the first floor, high up in the bu ilding.  “Upper” has a couple of different meanings; take a look, again, at our Lear ning Guide for some more

explanations.  She then says, “You really don’t hav e a preference?” meaning there isn’t one particular kind of room that you wa nt besides an upper room or upper-floor room.  George says, “No, not really.”  Andrea says, “There is a penthouse room for 400 dollars a night.”  The “pent house,” especially in an expensive hotel or condominium building, is the hig hest floor, usually much bigger than the other rooms.  It is also, of course , the most expensive.

George says, “What?!  For that price (for 400 dolla rs), I’d better get a view of the Eiffel Tower, the Parthenon, and the Great Wall of China!”  Once again, George is making a joke here.  He’s saying that if he has to pay 400 dollars a night, he should have a view of some of the great landmarks o r places in the world.  He should be able to see the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Parthenon in Athens, or the Great Wall of China.  Obviously, George doesn’t sta y in expensive hotels very often!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Andrea:  Help me decide on which type of hotel room  to book.

George:  I want the one with a bed.

Andrea:  Very funny.  We have a choice of different  views, and each one is a different price.  For instance, a room with a city view is 175 dollars a night and a panoramic view is 275 dollars a night.

George:  275 dollars a night?!  That’s highway robb ery!

Andrea:  If you think that’s too steep, there are a  few other options.  We can get a courtyard room with no view for 120 dollars a night  or a room with an obstructed or peek-a-boo ocean views for 130 dollars a night.

George:  I don’t really care which type of room we get as long as we don’t end up with a room on the ground floor.  I don’t like havi ng people walking back and forth outside my window all night.

Andrea:  Okay, I can request a room on an upper flo or.  You really don’t have a preference?

Andrea:  There is a penthouse room for 400 dollars a night.

George:  What?!  For that price, I’d better get a v iew of the Eiffel Tower, the Parthenon, and the Great Wall of China!

# Dangerous Freeway Driving

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 691: Dangerous Freeway Driving.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 691.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at eslpod.com to download a Learn ing Guide for this episode that includes a complete transcript of everything w e say.  How do you get the Learning Guide?  Well, you can become a member of E SL Podcast and get that guide; just go to eslpod.com for more information.

This episode is called “Dangerous Freeway (or Highw ay) Driving.”  Let’s get started. > I do a lot of driving in my job.  You would think t hat driving several hours each way would get old really fast, but I have ways of m aking an interminable drive seem much more exciting.
> I like to drive fast on the freeways.  I usually pa ss all of the slower cars by staying in the passing lane.  When there’s a slow-moving ca r in the passing lane, though, I tailgate it until the driver moves over to anothe r lane.  If the driver doesn’t move over, I weave back and forth from one lane to anoth er until I get around it.  What can I say?  I just don’t like anyone to keep me fro m the open road.
> Sometimes, I encounter another driver who likes to drive fast and we have a drag race.  I know how to bird dog the other car until I  see a way to speed up and overtake it.  That’s why I almost always win.
> As you can see, I know how to spice up a boring dri ve.  I hope to see you soon – on the road.

Our story begins with the person telling the story – not me, I don’t do a lot of driving in my job.  But, the person in our story do es a lot of driving.  He says, “You would think that driving several hours each wa y would get old really fast.” “Each way” is another way of saying in both directi ons, going somewhere and

coming back.  When you leave your house, go to your  work, then leave your work at the end of the day and return to your house , we would call that a “round trip.”  Well, this is both ways of the round trip, each way.  “To get old” here means to become boring, uninteresting, we might say “mono tonous.”  There are other meanings of that expression, “get old.”  Take a loo k at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

So he says, “You would think (in other words, it wo uld seem likely to you) that driving several hours each way would get old real f ast, but I have ways of making an interminable drive seem much more exciting.”  “I nterminable” (interminable) means very long, almost without an end; in fact, it  does mean without an end. But more generally, it means uninteresting, boring,  very long.  That’s the idea here.

The narrator here, the person telling the story, sa ys that he has ways of making an interminable drive “seem” or appear much more ex citing.  How does he make it more exciting?  Well, he tells us.  He says he l ikes to drive fast on the freeways.  The “freeway” is the same as the highway .  In some parts of the U.S., they call it an “expressway.”  These are roads that  are built that you can drive fast on, often you don’t even half to stop, especia lly if it’s what we call an “interstate” freeway.  Those usually have no stops in them; you get on and off, but you don’t have stop signs or stop lights.  He s ays he likes to drive fast on the freeways, “I usually pass all of the slower cars by  staying in the passing lane.” “To pass” (pass) here means to drive your car aroun d another car so that you can be in front of them or ahead of them.  “Pass” h as many meanings in English; take a look, once again, at the Learning Guide for some more explanation.

So, he likes to pass all of these slower cars, the cars moving more slowly.  How does he pass them?  He stays in the passing lane.  “Lanes” are the areas on the freeway where you have a line of cars driving.  If it’s a two-lane freeway, there are cars in one direction and cars in the other dir ection, only one section of the road for each way.  Of course, in most big cities, in fact in all of the United States, you will find four-lane freeways, with two lanes go ing each way, six-lane freeways, eight-lane freeways, ten-lane freeways, a nd so forth.  Here in Southern California, some of our freeways probably have tota l 12 or 14 lanes, at least at their widest section.  However, there are only usua lly three or four lanes going in a single direction.  In the United States the “pass ing lane,” the fastest lane is the lane that is farthest to the left.  The left lane i s the lane where faster cars travel; it’s sometimes called the “passing lane,” because t hat’s how you get around the slower moving cars in front of you.  Here in Los An geles, I’m not sure about other cities, we also number the lanes.  The left-most la ne, the passing lane, is the number one lane.  Sometimes when there are accident s, they will announce on

the news that there is an accident blocking the num ber four lane.  That would be the lane four over from left, and so forth.

Continuing on then, the narrator says that when the re’s a slow-moving car in the passing lane, in other words a car that is not goin g fast in the so-called fast lane or passing lane, he tailgates the car until the dri ver moves over to another lane. “To tailgate,” here, means to follow another car to o closely, meaning it’s dangerous.  It’s used sometimes by drivers to indic ate to the driver in front of them that they need them or want them to move over.   Tailgating a car can be very dangerous, as well as illegal.  There’s anothe r meaning of “tailgate,” and that is to have a party – have a celebration where you eat and especially where you drink before a sporting event.  You drive your car to the parking lot, and then you have a little party outside of the stadium befo re you go in.  That’s called “tailgating.”  The reason is is that when you have a big station wagon, a long car, the back door is called the “tailgate door,” or sim ply the “tailgate,” and that’s where the expression, I think, comes from.  We used  to tailgate at baseball games and soccer games when I was a boy, many years  ago.

The narrator says, “If the driver doesn’t move over ,” doesn’t move to the number two lane, next to the number one or fast lane, he w eaves back and forth from one lane to another.  “To weave” (weave) here means to change lanes many different times in order to go faster.  So, there’s a slow ca r in front of you, you move over to the next lane, and then there’s another slow car , you move back to that original lane, and so forth.  In California, where we have many lanes going in each direction, it’s a little easier for you to do;  people do it all the time, weave back and forth.  But of course, it can also be dang erous if you are weaving, or moving at a high speed.

The narrator says, “What can I say?”  That expressi on, an informal one, means that you are saying that what you do is not good, i s bad, or is inappropriate, perhaps even dangerous, but that you are not going to change the way you act. You might say, “What can I say?  I know smoking is bad for me, but I’m going to continue to smoke.”  That’s not a personal example;  I don’t smoke, but someone who does could say that.  So he says, “What can I s ay?  I just don’t like anyone to keep me from the open road.”   “To keep (someone ) from (someone else or something)” means to prevent that person from havin g or doing something, not allow them to have or do something.  “The father ke pt his son from driving, because the son was not a very good driver.”  He di d not allow him – give him permission to drive.

The narrator doesn’t like anyone keeping him from t he open road.  “The open road” is the idea that you can drive fast down the freeway, and there are very few

other cars around you.  Here, he’s referring to slo w moving cars, if you remember.  He’s trying to get around them so he can  move fast.  Some people like the feeling of driving fast.  He says, “Someti mes, I encounter (that is, I meet) another driver who likes to drive fast and we have a drag race.”  A “drag (drag) race” is an informal competition to see which car c an go fast enough.  If you’ve watched a movie about the 1950s and 60s in the Unit ed States, you may have seen a drag race, where two high school boys will b e in their cars and they will race to see who is the fastest.  That’s a “drag rac e.”  More commonly, perhaps, two usually young male drivers will be next to each  other at a stop light, and they will race each other to the next stop light or to w herever they’re going.

The narrator says, “I know how to bird dog the othe r car until I see a way to speed up and overtake it.”  “To bird dog” (two word s) means to observe, to watch, to monitor something very carefully.  He bir d dogs, or watches the other car until he sees a way, sees a manner in which he can speed up.  “To speed up” means to go faster; “to accelerate,” we could also say.  He speeds up and he overtakes the other car.  “To overtake (someone)” m eans to go faster than them so that you are in front of them.  You were behind them before, but now you go in front of them because you are moving faster.  That’ s why, he says, he almost always wins these drag races, because he’s able to speed up and overtake the other car.

Finally he says, “As you can see, I know how to spi ce up a boring drive.”  “To spice up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning here t o make something more exciting, to make something more interesting.  “Spi ce” is what you add to food that gives it a different taste, or perhaps for cer tain kinds of food makes it hotter – hotter in taste, not necessarily temperature.  So, he spices up his boring drive. He ends by saying, “I hope to see you soon – on the  road.”  “On the road” means in your car while you are traveling.  Of course, mo st of us hope that we don’t see this kind of dangerous driver on the road, or anywh ere else.  That’s what happens when you get older, you realize just how da ngerous you were when you were younger!

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I do a lot of driving in my job.  You would think t hat driving several hours each way would get old really fast, but I have ways of m aking an interminable drive seem much more exciting.

I like to drive fast on the freeways.  I usually pa ss all of the slower cars by staying in the passing lane.  When there’s a slow-moving ca r in the passing lane, though, I tailgate it until the driver moves over to anothe r lane.  If the driver doesn’t move over, I weave back and forth from one lane to anoth er until I get around it.  What can I say?  I just don’t like anyone to keep me fro m the open road.

Sometimes, I encounter another driver who likes to drive fast and we have a drag race.  I know how to bird dog the other car until I  see a way to speed up and overtake it.  That’s why I almost always win.

As you can see, I know how to spice up a boring dri ve.  I hope to see you soon – on the road.

[end of story]

Our scripts never get old.  Even after writing hund reds and hundreds our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse, spices them up and keep s them interesting.

# Recommending Someone for a Job

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 692: Recommending Someone for a Job.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 692.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Recommending Someone for a Job.”  It’s a dialogue between Harry and Judy.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Harry:  I’ve put in a good word for you with my bos s.  He said to stop by the store at 4:00 today and he’ll interview you for the job.

Judy:  Okay, I think I can make it around 4:00.

Harry:  Not around 4:00.  You need to be there at 4 :00 sharp, got that?  I’m sticking my neck out for you by recommending you for this job, so don’t let me down.

Judy:  All right, I’ll be there.  It’s not like it’ s my idea to get a job at your store.  I didn’t ask you to put your reputation on the line.  I don’t think that job is a good fit for me.

Harry:  You can’t afford to be choosy.  You need a job and you need it right now.

Judy:  I’m not in a hurry.  I want to find a job th at really suits my talents.

Harry:  I’m sick of you sleeping on my couch and mo oching off me.  By the time you find a job that suits your talents, I’ll be in a nursing home – or an insane asylum!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Harry saying, “I’ve put in  a good word for you with my boss.”  The expression “to put in a good word for ( someone)” means to say

something good about another person to a possible e mployer or someone who you are looking for a favor from or to get somethin g from.  More generally, it means to recommend someone for an opportunity or a position – “to put in a good word for someone.”  “I will put in a good word  for you with Dr. Lucy Tse, and maybe in our Café we’ll answer your question.”  “I’ll put in a good word for you.”  Harry says that his boss had to stop by the store at 4:00 today and he’ll interview you for the job.  “To stop by” is a phras al verb meaning to go somewhere for a short period of time.  “Tomorrow, I  will stop by your house and have a cup of coffee,” I won’t be there for hours a nd hours, just a short amount of time.  Harry’s boss is going to stop by the store –  we guess that Harry and Judy work in a store, or that at least Harry does – and the boss will “interview” Judy. He will have a formal meeting where he will ask que stions to see if she is a good person for this job.

Judy says, “Okay, I think I can make it around 4:00 .”  When someone says “around 4:00” they mean approximately; maybe a few minutes before, maybe a few minutes after.  Harry says, however, “Not aroun d 4:00.  You need to be here at 4:00 sharp, got that?”  “Sharp” is here used to mean exactly, precisely, at a specific time.  So when we’re talking about time, a nd you want to give someone an exact time, you might say, “I want you to leave at 8:45 sharp.”  That means exactly at 8:45, not before, not after.  Another wa y of saying this would be “on the dot.”  “I want you here by 8:00 on the dot.”  That’ s exactly at 8:00.

Harry says, “I’m sticking my neck out for you.”  “T o stick your neck out for (someone)” means to take a risk, to perhaps say som ething or do something that could hurt you but it could also help you or, in th is case, help someone else.  “I’m going to stick my neck out for my brother and say t hat he will be here at 8:00.”  If he isn’t here at 8:00 I might be in trouble, but I am going to take a risk; I’m going to stick my neck out for him.  In general, you can use the expression not for “him,” but for yourself; you can just say, “I’m goi ng to stick my neck and say that the capital of Spain is Madrid.”  You’re saying I m ight be wrong; I’m taking a risk. If I’m wrong, I’m sure several thousand Spaniards w ill email me, so I’m sticking my neck out.  Actually, I’m pretty sure Madrid is t he capital of Spain!

So, Harry is sticking his neck out for Judy.  How i s he doing that?  By recommending her for the job.  “To recommend,” of c ourse, means to say something that someone should do or not do based on  or coming from your own opinions, knowledge, or experiences.  Harry is stic king his neck out for Judy by recommending her for the job.  “So,” he says, “don’ t let me down.”  “To let (someone) down,” or “to let down (someone),” is ano ther phrasal verb meaning to disappoint someone, not to meet someone’s expect ations.

Judy says, “All right, I’ll be there.  It’s not lik e it’s my idea to get a job at your store.”  Notice that she introduces this sentence b y saying “It’s not like.”  That means that what you are saying is the opposite of w hat you think is true or you know to be true.  “It’s not like it’s my idea to ge t a job at your store” means it is not Judy’s idea to get a job at Harry’s store.  She  says, “I didn’t ask you to put your reputation on the line.”  “To put your reputat ion on the line” means to put your reputation at risk, to do something or say som ething that might change the way people think about you.  “Reputation” is what o ther people think about you, their opinions of you.  Judy says that she didn’t a sk Harry to put his reputation on the line by recommending her.  She says, in fact, “ I don’t think that job is a good fit for me.”  “To be a good fit” (fit) means to be a good match, when something is comfortable or convenient, when two people or a per son and a situation seem to be matched for each other.  “I like big cities, so living in Los Angeles is a good fit for me,” meaning I will be comfortable or happy bec ause I like big cities, and Los Angeles is a big city.

Harry says to Judy, “You can’t afford to be choosy. ”  “To afford (afford) to do (something)” means to be able to do something becau se it does not present any problems for you.  It could also mean to have enoug h money to do something: “I can’t afford to go to Las Vegas this weekend; I don ’t have any money to lose.” “To afford to” can also mean something without mone y, and that’s the case in this example.  Harry says to Judy, “You can’t affor d to be choosy (choosy).”  “To be choosy” means to be willing to take or have only  the things that meet your very high standards or high expectations.  Another word for this is “picky” (picky). Someone who is “choosy” doesn’t take the first thin g they see, they wait until they get the best thing – the “best fit,” you could  say, for their situation.  Some men and women don’t get married as early as they us ed to nowadays; some people say that’s because they’re being too choosy – too picky, waiting for the perfect man or the perfect woman rather than someon e they could grow to love. That’s some people’s opinion; not mine necessarily.

Harry says that Judy can’t afford to be choosy.  “Y ou need a job and you need it right now.”  Judy says, “I’m not in a hurry.  I wan t to find a job that really suits my talents.”  “To suit (suit) your talents” means to m ake good use of your strengths and interests, to be something that matches your qu alifications, what you are able to do.

Harry says, “I’m sick of you sleeping on my couch a nd mooching off me.”  Now we understand why Harry wants Judy to get a job.  J udy is staying at Harry’s apartment, and he says she is mooching off him.  “T o mooch (mooch) off (someone)” is an informal expression meaning to tak e things for free from another person, especially money, food, clothing, a nd not offering to pay them

anything.  Judy is mooching off Harry by staying at  his apartment and not paying any money.

He says, “By the time you find a job that suits you r talents, I’ll be in a nursing home – or an insane asylum!”  Harry is saying that Judy is taking a long time to find a job, and if she waits until she finds the pe rfect job, one that suits her talents, Harry will be in a nursing home.  A “nursi ng home” is a place where typically old people go because they have medical p roblems and they need a lot of extra care and help from doctors and nurses.  It ’s not a hospital; it’s a place where people live for a long time when they need ex tra help, especially medical help.  An “insane asylum” is also called a “mental institution.”  It’s a place where people who have mental problems or psychological pr oblems go; it’s where crazy people go, to put it another way.  There are lots o f informal ways of talking about an insane asylum.  Harry is suggesting that he will  go crazy if he waits for Judy to find a job that suits her talents.  So, he is press uring her; he is trying to make her get a job so she can go somewhere else to live.  I don’t blame Harry!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Harry:  I’ve put in a good word for you with my bos s.  He said to stop by the store at 4:00 today and he’ll interview you for the job.

Judy:  Okay, I think I can make it around 4:00.

Harry:  Not around 4:00.  You need to be there at 4 :00 sharp, got that?  I’m sticking my neck out for you by recommending you for this job, so don’t let me down.

Judy:  All right, I’ll be there.  It’s not like it’ s my idea to get a job at your store.  I didn’t ask you to put your reputation on the line.  I don’t think that job is a good fit for me.

Harry:  You can’t afford to be choosy.  You need a job and you need it right now.

Judy:  I’m not in a hurry.  I want to find a job th at really suits my talents.

Harry:  I’m sick of you sleeping on my couch and mo oching off me.  By the time you find a job that suits your talents, I’ll be in a nursing home – or an insane asylum!

# Following a Dress Code

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 693: Following a Dress Code.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 693.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

We invite you – I invite you to go to our website a t eslpod.com.  There, you will find a Learning Guide for this episode, and your li fe will be better after that.

This episode is a dialogue between Tae and Nicole.  They’re going to be talking about a “dress code,” when certain organizations ha ve requirements for how you must dress.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tae:  What are you doing?  Why are you taking all o f my clothes out of my suitcase?  I just finished packing that.

Nicole:  You’ve packed all of the wrong things.  We ’re going on a luxury cruise and all you’ve packed are shorts and t-shirts.

Tae:  I’m going on vacation and I don’t have to dre ss to impress.

Nicole:  You’ve never been on a cruise like this on e, but I have, and there’s a dress code.  You’ll need formal wear for some of the dinners.

Tae:  I’m not wearing a suit and tie on vacation.

Nicole:  No, not a suit and tie.  There’ll be a dan ce the final night of the cruise that’s black tie, so you’ll need your tuxedo.  I’m bringing a few cocktail dresses myself.  Don’t worry.  You can go semi-formal the r est of the evenings.

Tae:  This is ridiculous.  I have to wear business attire 300 days out of the year and you’re making me dress up when I finally go on a vacation.

Nicole:  You don’t have to dress up the entire time .  You can go California casual during the day.  I’m just asking that you look pres entable a few hours each day. Is that so hard?

Tae:  I knew there was a catch when you booked this  vacation.  It’s less a vacation for me than a dress-up party for you!

[end of dialogue]

Tae begins by saying to Nicole, “What are you doing ?  Why are you taking all of my clothes out of my suitcase?  I just finished pac king that.”  So, Tae and Nicole are going on a trip somewhere, and Tae has put all of his clothes into his “suitcase,” which is a big bag or container for you r clothing when you travel; it could also be called a piece of “luggage.”  He says , “I just finished packing that.” “To pack” (pack) means, in this case, to put things  into a bag or a suitcase so that you can take them with you when you travel.  “ Pack” has a couple of other meanings, as well.  Take a look at our Learning Gui de for this episode to get more information.

Nicole says, “You’ve packed all of the wrong things .  We’re going on a luxury cruise and all you’ve packed are shorts and t-shirt s.”  A “cruise” is when you get on a big boat and you sleep on the boat – really, i t’s a ship – and you go with all these other people on the ship and you usually trav el for three or four days, maybe a week or two weeks.  Everyone has their own room, and it is for some people very enjoyable.  I have to say I have been o n a couple of short, three-day cruises from Los Angeles down to Ensenada, Mexico, and I didn’t like them very much.  I didn’t like the food; I didn’t like being on a big ship…eh, but some people love it.  And so, if you like that sort of thing, t hat’s great.  Not for me.  Anyway, Nicole says they’re going on a luxury cruise.  “Lux ury” usually means very expensive, something that’s very nice.  But Tae has  just packed shorts and t- shirts, so he doesn’t have anything very nice to we ar.

Tae said, “I’m going on vacation and I don’t have t o dress to impress.”  This is an expression: “to dress to impress” means to choose y our clothing so that other people will have a good opinion of you.  If you are  going to an interview for a job, you should dress to impress; you should want the ot her person to think that you are very professional, that you take this interview  seriously, and so forth, and by wearing the right clothing then you can impress the  other person.  “To impress” means to give a good opinion to someone else about you.

Nicole says, “You’ve never been on a cruise like th is one, but I have, and there’s a dress code.”  “Code” (code) is another name for a  rule or law; here, it refers to the rules that the ship has about how you dress.  I t’s called a “dress code.”  Many businesses have dress codes; you can’t come in with out a tie, women can’t wear miniskirts, men can’t wear miniskirts – I mean some  of them can be very difficult to follow!  My old school, where I went grade schoo l and high school, had a dress

code.  The boys all had to wear shirts and ties and  black pants and black shoes and black socks.  That was the dress code.  Well, t he ship for the luxury cruise has a dress code.  Nicole says that Tae will need f ormal wear for some of the dinners.  “Formal wear” (wear) is clothing that is used for very special occasions. A wedding, a funeral, an important party such as an  anniversary, these would be times for formal wear.  Also, some restaurants requ ire formal wear.

Tae says, “I’m not wearing a suit and tie on vacati on.”  A “tie” is what a typically man puts on; it’s a long piece of fabric – of cloth  – that is in the front from your neck down to, say, your waist.  A “suit” refers to a jacket and pants that go together that are very formal looking.  The word “s uit” can be used both for a man and a woman, but “suit and tie” usually refers to w hat a man would wear.

Nicole says, “No, not a suit and tie.  There’ll be a dance the final night of the cruise that’s black tie.”  “Black tie” means that i t will be a very formal, a very fancy event, and the men will have to wear tuxedos.  A “t uxedo” (tuxedo) is a special type of suit that men wear for very formal occasion s such as a wedding, but only the men who are participating in the wedding; the g room and the best man, for example, typically would wear a tux or a tuxedo.  W e call it a “tux” (tux) for short. If you are going to the Academy Awards in Hollywood  to receive an Oscar for your latest movie, then you would wear, if you were  a man, a tuxedo.  I plan on wearing a tuxedo when I am given an award for my si nging at the Grammy Awards, they’re called here in the U.S.; I’m just w aiting for my invitation!

Nicole says, “I’m bringing a few cocktail dresses m yself.”  A “cocktail (cocktail) dress” is a short or long dress worn by women for a  special occasion.  A “cocktail” is actually another word for an alcoholi c drink, but a “cocktail dress” is a formal dress that a woman would wear.  Nicole says,  “Don’t worry.  You can go semi-formal rest of the evenings.”  “Semi” means ha lf or partly, so “semi-formal” means not completely formal but not completely the opposite, what we would call “casual.”  The opposite of “formal,” when we’re tal king about clothing, is “casual.”

Tae says, “This is ridiculous,” meaning this is sil ly, this is something very strange, something that people would laugh at.  He says, “I have to wear business attire 300 days out of the year and you’re making me dress  up when I finally go on vacation.”  “Business attire” is another term for b usiness clothing, the kind of clothes you would wear to your office or wherever y ou work.  “Attire” (attire) is just another word for clothing.  Tae is complaining  that he has to dress up most of the days of the year in order to go to work, and  now, when he’s going on vacation, he doesn’t want to dress up.  “To dress u p” is a two-word – everyone say it with me – phrasal verb that means to wear cl othing that is nicer than what

you normally wear, or what you would wear on the we ekend let’s say.  Tae doesn’t want to dress up for vacation.

Nicole says, “You don’t have to dress up the entire  (or the whole) time”, that is, not every day on the vacation.  “You can go Califor nia casual during the day.” “California casual” means that you wear clothing th at is not quite as nice as a suit and tie, but not jeans and t-shirts either; it’s so rt of semi-formal.  California has the reputation of being more relaxed in terms of ho w people dress.  If you go to Hawaii, people are really relaxed – the island of H awaii.  California, however, is more casual, less formal in terms of the way people  dress here, in part because the weather is hotter and so it doesn’t makes sense  to dress up as much.  At least that’s my opinion.  Nicole says, “I’m just as king that you look presentable a few hours each day.”  “To look presentable” means t o look nice, to look clean, so that other people can see you.  When I get up in the morning, I go outside of my house and I get my newspaper, which was delivered t o my house.  I try to look presentable; I try to have at least some clothes on  so that if one of my neighbors saw me I wouldn’t be too embarrassed.  That’s “to b e presentable,” to look nice, to have clean clothing, and so forth.

Tae says, “I knew there was a catch when you booked  this vacation.”  A “catch” (catch) here means a trick, something that is hidde n, something that you don’t know about but you only find out later.  It sounds great, but then when you find the real truth it isn’t so great.  So, a “catch” is  the thing that you didn’t know about that isn’t so wonderful, and Tae says that he knew there was a catch when Nicole booked, or made the reservations – the plans  for their vacation on this luxury cruise.  He says, “It’s less a vacation for me than a dress-up party for you!” He’s saying that it isn’t really a vacation; it’s a n opportunity for Nicole to dress up, to wear nice clothing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tae:  What are you doing?  Why are you taking all o f my clothes out of my suitcase?  I just finished packing that.

Nicole:  You’ve packed all of the wrong things.  We ’re going on a luxury cruise and all you’ve packed are shorts and t-shirts.

Tae:  I’m going on vacation and I don’t have to dre ss to impress.

Nicole:  You’ve never been on a cruise like this on e, but I have, and there’s a dress code.  You’ll need formal wear for some of the dinners.

Tae:  I’m not wearing a suit and tie on vacation.

# Going to the Emergency Room

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 694: Going to the Emergency Room.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 694.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will make you healthy, wealthy, and wi se.

This episode is called “Going to the Emergency Room .”  This is the place you go in a hospital if you suddenly become sick or are hu rt.  Let’s get started. > Saturday, 9:35 p.m.
> I arrive in the emergency room.  I had been at a pa rty earlier in the evening when I accidentally cut my finger.  My finger wasn’t sev ered, but it did have a very deep cut and I thought I might need stitches.  I check i n at the admissions desk and I’m told to take a seat and wait.
> Saturday, 10:40 p.m.
> I’m still waiting to see a doctor.  The waiting roo m is filled to capacity and I expect it to be a long night.
> Saturday, 11:15 p.m.
> Several ambulances pull up to the door and EMTs whe el in several people on stretchers.  I hear that there had been a pileup on  Freeway 215 and these were the victims.  I can see a doctor performing triage and the most critical cases are taken into exam rooms and maybe directly into surge ry.
> Sunday, 1:25 p.m.
> I decide to give up and go home.  If I hadn’t bled to death by that time, I could probably wait until Monday to see my regular physic ian.
> Our story begins on a Saturday night, about 9:35 in  the evening, 9:35 p.m.  I say, “I arrive in the emergency room.”  The “emergency r oom,” sometimes called by its initials “E.R.,” is the part of a hospital that  is always open to people who are very sick and who may die if they don’t get medical  treatment – medical help – soon.  You can go to any emergency room in an Ameri can hospital and if you have a serious sickness or illness or injury they w ill help you.  There was a famous American TV show called E.R.  back in the 1990s.

My story continues: I say that I had been at a part y earlier in the evening when I accidentally cut my finger.  So, I’m at a party wit h friends, and by mistake – by accident, not on purpose – I cut my finger.  Actual ly, I did once cut my finger.  I wasn’t at a party; I was cooking, and then I had to  go to the emergency room for help.  But in our story, I’m at a party, which soun ds a lot funner.  I say, “My finger wasn’t severed, but it did have a very deep cut and  I thought I might need stitches.”  “To sever” (sever), as a verb, means to  separate, usually by cutting. We often talk about that when it happens to one of the parts of your body: “His leg was severed in a car accident.”  “Severed,” the n, means separated or detached.  So, my finger was not severed, I still h ad my finger on my hand, but I did have a very deep cut and I thought I might need  stitches.  I thought it was possible that in order to make myself better I need ed to get stitches.  “Stitch” (stitch) is a piece of very thin material, “thread”  it’s called, that goes into your skin in order to close a very wide or deep cut.  “Stitch es” are sort of like when you have a rip in your piece of clothing; if you rip yo ur shirt you might take some thread and stitch up the rip so that it’s together,  the shirt doesn’t have a hole in it anymore.  Well, the same thing happens with your sk in – with your body, you can stitch it up with this special thread, and that’s w hat I mean here when I say “I might need stitches.”  “Stitch” has a couple of oth er meanings in English as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.

So, I say that I check in at the admissions desk an d I’m told to take a seat and wait.  The “admissions desk” is the place where you  first go in a hospital, or perhaps just an office, and you are asking for an a ppointment; you’re asking to see the doctor; you’re asking to be admitted.  “To be admitted” means to be let in, you can go into wherever you want to go.  Colle ges and universities have admissions offices that are in charge of, or respon sible for, deciding which students will get to study at that college.  An adm issions desk at a hospital is where you go when you get there to tell them your n ame, your telephone

number, your insurance information, and so forth.  Well I check in, I go to the admissions desk, and they tell me to wait, to “take  a seat,” that is, to sit down in a chair.

Saturday at 10:40 p.m.  I’m still waiting to see a doctor, more than an hour after I arrive.  This is not unusual in an emergency room; they take the most serious cases first.  If you cut your finger, as I did, wel l, you’re going to have to wait sometimes a couple of hours before you can see a do ctor, because you’re not going to die if you don’t see a doctor in the first  couple of hours.  So, that’s what is happening; I am sitting in the emergency room, i t’s Saturday night, and the waiting room is filled to capacity.  The “waiting r oom” is a room – an area where you have a lot of chairs and are asked to wait in f or your appointment.  This is especially common for doctors; dentists, other medi cal professionals have waiting rooms.  These are places where you are goin g to wait for the doctor to finish playing golf and come back to the hospital.  “To be filled to capacity” means to be completely full, there isn’t room for anyone else, in this case, to sit.  On a Saturday night, emergency rooms are often filled to  capacity; the waiting room is full of people who have had accidents.  The weekend s are times when more people drink alcohol, and that usually leads to mor e problems medically speaking; people get into car accidents and that so rt of thing – shootings with guns, you know, the stuff you watch on TV.

Well, on Saturday at 11:15 p.m., now an hour and 45  minutes or more since I first arrived, I see several ambulances pull up to the do or.  An “ambulance” is a special car – a special vehicle that transports peo ple who have medical problems.  So, there are several ambulances that “p ull up,” or drive up to the door of the emergency room, and EMTs wheel in sever al people on stretchers. An “EMT” is an emergency medical technician, someon e who gives medical assistance when you are hurt.  They’re not doctors,  but they do help people who are injured get from their home or wherever they we re hurt to the hospital.  So they know some things in order to try to keep you a live if it’s a serious injury.  My brother-in-law is an EMT in Minnesota.  So, if you’ re ever in an ambulance in Minnesota, you should say, “Hey, do you know Jeff M cQuillan from ESL Podcast?” and if the person says yes, then that cou ld be my brother-in-law. Probably not, though.  A “stretcher” (stretcher) is  a long, portable bed, really, that we use to carry people in when they are sick or hur t.  In a hospital, the stretchers are usually on wheels, that’s why the story says the EMTs “wheel in” several people.  They bring several people in on these port able beds called “stretchers.”

I continue my story: “I hear that there had been a pileup on Freeway 215 and these were the victims.”  A “pileup” (pileup – one word) is a traffic accident involving many different cars; one car hitting anot her, and then another car hitting

that car, and so forth.  That’s called a “pileup.”  There had been a pileup on the 215 freeway, and these were the people who were hur t; these were the “victims.” “I can see a doctor performing triage and the most critical cases are taken into exam rooms and maybe directly into surgery.”  “Tria ge” (triage) is the process of determining which patients are the sickest, who nee ds help first.  “Critical cases” are very serious cases, usually ones that are what we would call “life- threatening,” meaning you could die if you don’t ge t proper help quickly.  “Critical” has other meanings in English as well; take a look at the Learning Guide for those.  An “exam room” is short for an examination room.  This is not where you take a test; it’s where the doctor looks at you to see what’s wrong with you.  The doctor “examines” you; he or she will look at you c losely.  “Surgery” is where they cut open some part of your body in order to fix som ething or to help you in some way.  So, the doctors are performing triage, and the most critical – the most serious cases are taken into exam rooms for the doc tors to look at them, and maybe directly into surgery, where the doctors will  – we use the verb “perform” – perform surgery on them.

Sunday, 1:25 p.m.  Remember, I arrived at 9:35 p.m.  on Saturday night; now, it’s already Sunday afternoon.  I say, “I decide to give  up and go home.”  “To give up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop tryi ng to do something, usually because it’s very difficult or impossible.  “Don’t give up,” we sometimes say to people, meaning don’t stop trying.  Well, I decide to give up and go home.  “If I hadn’t bled to death by that time, I could probably  wait until Monday to see my regular physician.”  “Bled” is the past tense of the verb “to bleed” (bleed).  It’s irregular, it’s not “bleeded” in the past tense, it ’s “bled” (bled).  “To bleed to death” would mean to die because you are losing so much “b lood,” that red liquid that comes out of your body when you cut it.  Well, I’m kind of making a joke here.  I say because I haven’t bled to death, I can probably  wait another day and go see my regular doctor – my regular “physician” on Monda y.  This is not uncommon for emergency rooms to be very crowded in some hosp itals in some cities in the U.S., especially public hospitals.

I conclude by saying that my evening in the emergen cy room wasn’t a total loss. A “total loss” would be something that has no usefu l purpose or useful result, something that didn’t give you anything.  “I learne d a valuable lesson: Never voluntarily go to the emergency room!”  “Voluntaril y” means no one is forcing you, you decide that you are going to go on your ow n.  That’s probably not very good advice, however.  If you’re really sick or hur t, you should definitely go to the emergency room.  It’s better than staying where you  are and getting no help whatsoever.  In my own case, I ended up staying at the hospital probably about three or four hours before I got to see a doctor wh o gave me some stitches in my thumb, and now I’m all better.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of story]

Saturday, 9:35 p.m.

I arrive in the emergency room.  I had been at a pa rty  earlier in the evening when I accidentally cut my finger.  My finger wasn’ t severed, but it did have a very deep cut and I thought I might need stitches.  I check in at the admissions desk and I’m told to take a seat and wait.

Saturday, 10:40 p.m.

I’m still waiting to see a doctor.  The waiting roo m is filled to capacity and I expect it to be a long night.

Saturday, 11:15 p.m.

Several ambulances pull up to the door and EMTs whe el in several people on stretchers.  I hear that there had been a pileup on  Freeway 215 and these were the victims.  I can see a doctor performing triage and the most critical cases are taken into exam rooms and maybe directly into surge ry.

Sunday, 1:25 p.m.

I decide to give up and go home.  If I hadn’t bled to death by that time, I could probably wait until Monday to see my regular physic ian.

My evening in the emergency room wasn’t a total los s, though.  I learned a valuable lesson: Never voluntarily go to the emerge ncy room!

Carmen:  Hold your horses.  I’m on the verge of bei ng ready.  Rome wasn’t built in a day, you know.

Eric:  A day?  I’d settle for a week.  Why is it th at every time we have someplace to be you’re always running late?

Carmen:  That’s because I march to the beat of a di fferent drummer.  Life isn’t about watching the clock; it’s about living in the moment.

Eric:  Okay, at this very moment, we’re late.

Carmen:  Just give me a couple of minutes more and I’ll be ready.  After all, none of our friends expect us to be punctual anymore.  T hey all know better.

Eric:  Yeah, and I should, too.  From now on, I’ll start getting ready when you say you’re all set.  Then I’ll just have minutes to wai t – not hours!

[end of dialogue]

Eric starts off, or begins our dialogue by saying t o Carmen, “Let’s get a move on or we’ll be late – again!”  “To get a move on” mean s to hurry, to rush, to do something quickly.  “We better get a move on or we will be late for dinner with our friends.”  Eric says to Carmen hurry up, basica lly.

Carmen says, “Hold your horses.”  “To hold your hor ses” is an old expression meaning to wait, to be patient, to stop rushing or hurrying another person, probably because horses, when they are scared espec ially, sometimes go very fast, you have to control them.  Well, Carmen is te lling Eric to hold his horses, meaning stop rushing her, stop trying to make her g o faster than she is.  She says, “I’m on the verge of being ready.”  “To be on  the verge (verge) of (something)” means almost, very soon, it’s just abo ut to happen.  Because “of” is a preposition the word that comes after it, if it’s  a verb, has to be changed into what’s called a gerund, making it the object of the  preposition as a noun.  So, you notice Carmen says, “I’m on the verge of being (bei ng) ready,” “being” is a gerund.  You could say, “I’m on the verge of going to the store.”  “I’m on the verge of winning this poker game,” or whatever.  “R ome wasn’t built in a day, you know,” Carmen says.  This is also an old expression : “Rome wasn’t built in a day.”  It means that if you are doing something imp ortant it takes time; it can take a long time, you can’t try to do it quickly.  The g reat City of Rome, with all of its wonderful buildings and architecture, wasn’t built in a day, meaning it took many years – hundreds of years to make it what it is.  W ell, that’s the expression, and that’s what Carmen is saying to Eric.  She’s doing something great by preparing herself, I guess.

Eric says, “A day?  I’d settle for a week.”  “To se ttle for” is an expression that means to accept something that isn’t exactly what y ou wanted, but is good enough “I settled for living in this apartment.”  I t isn’t my favorite place, but it’s good enough for me.  It will be satisfactory; not g reat, not terrible.  Eric is making a joke, saying that, in effect, he doesn’t want to build Rome in a day, he would take a week, that would be okay.  Eric says, “Why i s it that every time we have someplace to be you’re always running late?”  “To r un late” means to be behind schedule, to do things too slowly so that you can’t  complete them when you are expected to complete them.

Carmen says, “That’s because I march to the beat of  a different drummer.”  This is another old expression: “To march to the beat (b eat) of a different drummer.” A “drummer” is someone who plays a drum, usually th ey have two sticks and they hit the drum.  The “beat” is the repeating str ess that appears – that you hear in the music.  It’s what you will often hear in a r ock band, for example, the drummer playing.  The drummer will be playing the s ame thing over and over again, repeating it.  That is often the beat for the song.  Carmen says, “I march (I walk) to the beat of a different drummer.”  What sh e’s saying is that I do things differently than other people, I don’t follow what everyone else does.  Drummers are often used especially in the military – or used  to be used – to keep everyone going forward at the same speed.  Carmen says, “Lif e isn’t about watching the clock; it’s about living in the moment.”  “To watch  the clock” means that you are

always aware of what time it is and you try to be p laces on time, on schedule, you’re not late.  You’re making sure that you arriv e or other people arrive on time. But that’s not what Carmen says life is about, that ’s not the purpose of life.  Life is about living in the moment.  “To live in the mom ent” means that you’re not thinking about or worrying about the past, you’re n ot worried about the future, you’re only thinking about what’s happening right n ow.  You want to experience the present completely and fully.  That’s to live i n the moment, not to worry about the future or the past, but just about what you are  experiencing right now.

Eric says, “Okay, at this very moment, we’re late.”   “Very” has many uses in English.  Here, it is used for emphasis to mean exa ctly or precisely.  “I fell in love with my now-wife the very moment I saw her the firs t time.”  At that exact moment, I fell in love.  Doesn’t every woman want t o hear that?  Eric says that at this very moment, right now, we’re late.

Carmen says, “Just give me a couple of minutes more  and I’ll be ready.”  “To give (someone) a couple of minutes” means to give t hem a little more time, not to try to rush them, not to try to make them go faster , not to continue asking them to go faster.  Carmen says, “After all, none of our fr iends expect us to be punctual anymore.  They all know better.”  She’s saying if y ou think about it, I mean in terms of what’s most important; that’s the meaning of the expression “after all.” “After all, none of our friends expect us to be pun ctual anymore.”  “To be punctual” (punctual) means to be on time, to arrive  when people are expecting you to arrive.  She says that their friends all kno w better.  The expression “to know better” means that you have enough experience of something or knowledge of something to know how it will actually  be, which is different than how it should be or how someone tells you it will b e.  So you might say, for example, “My sister-in-law said she would be here a t 5:30, but I know better. She won’t be here until six.”  “I know better,” I h ave experience; I have knowledge about when she normally arrives, and it’s  normally late.  I know better.

Eric says, “Yeah, and I should, too,” meaning I sho uld know better as well. “From now on, I’ll start getting ready when you say  you’re all set.”  “To be all set” means to be completely prepared, to be completely r eady, you don’t need any more time.  Eric says that when Carmen says that sh e’s all set, then he’ll start getting ready.  “Then,” he says, “I’ll just have mi nutes to wait – not hours!”  In other words, Eric is going to wait, in the future, until Carmen says she’s ready, and then he’ll get ready.  That way – in that manne r, he won’t have to wait hours for her to get ready, it will only be minutes.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Eric:  Let’s get a move on or we’ll be late – again !

Carmen:  Hold your horses.  I’m on the verge of bei ng ready.  Rome wasn’t built in a day, you know.

# Investing Your Money

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 696: Investing Your Money.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 696.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide.  Go to our website at eslpod.com and download the 8- to 10-page guide.   You’ll get a complete transcript of everything we say on this podcast, no t just the dialogue, as well as a lot of other good information to help you improve y our English.

This episode is a dialogue about “investments,” tak ing your money and putting it somewhere so that you can make more money.  Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Karen:  My company offers a 401(k) plan.  Do you th ink I should have one?

Jimmy:  Yes, definitely.  I had a 401(k) account wh en I worked for McQ Corp, and when I started working on my own I converted it to an IRA.

Karen:  I really don’t understand any of these inve stment options.  I talked to an investment specialist at my bank, but I left her of fice just as confused as when I went in.

Jimmy:  Look, you want to have a diversified portfo lio of lower-risk and higher- risk investments.  On the low-risk end, put money i n bonds, CDs, or a money market account.  You want to balance that out with some riskier investments that may bring a higher return, such as mutual funds and  stocks.

Karen:  Wow, all of that just went over my head.  I  don’t know a CD from a bond.

Jimmy:  It’s really simple.  Your choice ranges fro m a fixed return to a variable return, and the variable investments carry differen t levels of risk.

Karen:  My head hurts.  Are you sure I really need all of these investments?

Jimmy:  Not all of them, but it would be smart to i nvest your money in something.

Karen:  Not if I spend it all first, right?

Jimmy:  Right.  You know what they say: “A fool and  his money are soon parted!”

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Karen saying to Jimmy, “My  company offers a 401(k) plan.  Do you think I should have one?”  A “401(k)”  is the name the government gives a certain kind of retirement savings plan.  I t helps people save money by allowing the company to take money out of your week ly or monthly paycheck and put it into some sort of investment, typically some  sort of stock investment.  The advantage of the traditional 401(k) plan is that yo u don’t have to pay taxes on the money that you put into the account until you retir e.  That’s the traditional 401(k). It’s a plan that’s offer by private businesses, typ ically.  Government organizations have somewhat different plan names, but they have t he same function – they do the same thing.

Jimmy says to Karen, “Yes, definitely.  I had a 401 (k) account when I worked for McQ Corp (McQ Corporation, the name of the company) , and when I started working on my own I converted it to an IRA.”  An “I RA” is another kind of retirement savings account; this helps you save mon ey.  It’s something that you open, not your employer.  The 401(k) is something t hat the person or the company you work for operates.  An IRA is something  that you can open on your own, and there are different kinds of individual re tirement accounts.

Karen says, “I really don’t understand any of these  investment options.” “Investment” is when you use your money to make mor e money by buying stocks, or buying a building or a house, or part of  a business, and so forth. Karen says, “I talked to an investment specialist  (someone who’s an expert) at my bank, but I left her office just as confused as when I went in,” meaning she went to talk to the person but she was still unclea r; she was confused after she talked to her.

Jimmy says, “Look (meaning pay attention to what I’ m going to say), you want to have a diversified portfolio of lower-risk and high er-risk investments.” “Diversified” means it has a lot of different thing s in them, they’re not all the same.  A “portfolio” here means all of the investme nts that you own, especially stock investments.  So, a “diversified portfolio” i s one where you own a lot of different kinds of stocks.  Jimmy says you should o wn low- or lower-risk and high- or higher-risk investments.  “On the low-risk  end,” meaning some of the low-risk options, the ones that are not going to be  likely to lose you any money but you probably won’t gain a lot of money either, are bonds, CDs, and money

market account.  “Bonds” are basically an agreement  between a company or a government and you to give you a certain amount of money with interest after a certain number of years.  There are “short-term” bo nds, bonds that only last a few months or a few years; there are “long-term” bo nds that could last 15 or 20 years.  In both cases, you give the company – you l end the company, essentially, some money and the company pays you back with inter est at the end.  “CDs” stand for certificate of deposit.  That is similar,  but here you give your money to a bank, and the bank keeps your money for a certain a mount of time – six months, a year, two years – and at the end of that time the y give your money back with interest.  So, you’re kind of loaning your money to  the bank, and the bank is paying you for that loan by giving you interest on your CD.  CDs are very safe investments; you don’t make a lot of money, but you  probably won’t lose your money either.  A “money market” is perhaps the safe st kind of investment – the least risky investment.  That’s basically a checkin g account with your bank, and they give you interest – they pay you money for kee ping your money in the bank. So, we have bonds and CDs and money markets; these are low-risk investments.

Jimmy says, “You want to balance that out with some  riskier investments that may bring a higher return, such as mutual funds and  stocks.”  “To balance (something) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to keep a balance, to keep things even.  We sometimes talk about eating a balanced me al or having a balanced diet.  You should have some vegetables, some grains , some fruit, perhaps some meat, some fish, some candy – that’s a big part of a balanced diet, eating a lot of candy!  Well, this is a balanced portfolio, so if y ou have low-risk investments then you should have something on the other end, high-ri sk investments; that’s to balance things out.  You want a riskier investment in order to get a higher return. “Return,” when we’re talking about stocks and inves tments, is the percentage of money that you make or earn on your investment.  If  I give the bank 100 dollars and at the end of 6 months the bank gives me 105 do llars, with 5 dollars in interest, my return was 5 percent.  So, all investm ents have a return; sometimes you lose money, of course.  High-risk investments u sually have higher returns, but it’s also more likely that you will lose money.   So in order to get the higher return, you have to take more of a risk.  “Return” has a number of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for some additional explanations.

Some higher-risk investments include mutual funds a nd stocks.  Let’s start with “stocks.”  “Stocks” are partial ownership of a comp any.  That is, if you buy, for example, Apple stock or Microsoft stock, you own a little bit of that company.  So if the company does well, you will probably make mo ney.  “Stocks” are also sometimes called “shares” (shares).  A “mutual fund ” is typically a collection of

different kinds of stocks.  Usually you have many i nvestors who give money to a company that owns the mutual fund, and they buy a l ot of different kinds of stocks or a lot of different kinds of investments.  So, it’s something where you’re not buying the individual stock directly; you’re bu ying ownership in this mutual fund, and the fund will then go out and buy the sto cks or bonds or whatever investment they are investing in.

Karen says, “Wow, all of that just went over my hea d.”  “To go over your head” here means not to understand what the person is tal king about, usually because it’s very complicated and you don’t have much exper ience in it.  Karen says, “I don’t know a CD from a bond.”  This general express ion, “I don’t know (something) from (something else),” means you can’t  recognize the difference or don’t know the difference between these two things.   The opposite would be “to know (something) from (something else),” and that w ould be to understand the differences, but Karen doesn’t.

Jimmy says, “It’s really simple.  Your choice range s from a fixed return to a variable return, and the variable investments (or v ariable return investments) carry different levels of risk (or have different l evels of risk).”  “Ranges,” for something to range from something to something else , means that these are the maximum and minimum, or this is the difference in v alue from the low end to the high end.  In this case, the investment ranges from  fixed returns to variable returns.  “Fixed” here means it doesn’t change, it has a constant value.  The banks says that they will give you five percent int erest on your CD.  That’s not going to change; it’s not going to go up, it’s not going to go down.  For stocks and mutual funds and other variable return investments,  it could go up or it could go down.  “Variable” means changing; the value changes  over time.  The word “fixed” has a couple of other meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more information.

Karen says, “My head hurts.”  That’s kind of a funn y expression to mean this is so much information or difficult information to und erstand, I can’t understand it all.  She says, “Are you sure I really need all of these investments?”  Jimmy says, “Not all of them, but it would be smart to invest y our money in something.”  Karen says, “Not if I spend it all first, right?”  She’s making another joke; she’s saying, “Well, I don’t have to invest my money if I spend i t.”  Of course, if you spend it then you won’t have money in the future.  This is o ne of the great lessons in life that one must learn as you grow older, and some peo ple never learn that if you don’t save something today you won’t have anything tomorrow.

Karen is joking by saying that she doesn’t have to invest if she spends all of her money now.  Jimmy says, “Right,” meaning that’s rig ht, that’s correct.  Then he

uses an old expression: “A fool and his money are s oon parted.”  A “fool” is an idiot, a stupid person, an unwise person.  If you h ave a stupid person, usually or often they will lose their money.  “To be parted” m eans to be separated from.  So, the money and the fool are separated because the fo ol loses his money.  So, “a fool and his money are soon parted” means that peop le who aren’t very smart usually lose their money; they spend it or someone takes it from them in some fashion – in some way.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Karen:  My company offers a 401(k) plan.  Do you th ink I should have one?

Jimmy:  Yes, definitely.  I had a 401(k) account wh en I worked for McQ Corp, and when I started working on my own I converted it to an IRA.

Karen:  I really don’t understand any of these inve stment options.  I talked to an investment specialist at my bank, but I left her of fice just as confused as when I went in.

Jimmy:  Look, you want to have a diversified portfo lio of lower-risk and higher- risk investments.  On the low-risk end, put money i n bonds, CDs, or a money market account.  You want to balance that out with some riskier investments that may bring a higher return, such as mutual funds and  stocks.

Karen:  Wow, all of that just went over my head.  I  don’t know a CD from a bond.

Jimmy:  It’s really simple.  Your choice ranges fro m a fixed return to a variable return, and the variable investments carry differen t levels of risk.

Karen:  My head hurts.  Are you sure I really need all of these investments?

# Eating a School Lunch

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 697: Eating a School Lunch.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 697.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Eating a School Lunch.”  It ’s a dialogue between Chris and Sybil related to kids – high school students; e lementary school students – eating lunch at their school.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chris:  What are you doing?  Let’s get into the hot  lunch line.

Sybil:  See this lunchbox?  My mom made me brown-ba g it today.  She says that the lunches served at school aren’t nutritious enou gh.

Chris:  That sucks.  What did she make you?

Sybil:  A salad.

Chris:  Oh, gross.  I really feel sorry for you.  W hat else?

Sybil:  Let me see.  There are some carrot sticks, too.

Chris:  Sucker!  You should have thrown a fit.  I w ouldn’t have taken it lying down.  Listen to me.  You should ditch that lunch a nd buy lunch instead, like me.

Sybil:  I can’t.  I don’t have any lunch money.  Do  you want to trade some of yours for mine?

Chris:  You’re dreaming.  There’s no way I’m tradin g my pizza for your salad and carrot sticks.

Sybil:  Not even if I do your math homework?

Chris:  Math homework?  Now you’ve got my attention .

Sybil:  Only if you give me the entire slice of piz za.

Chris:  You drive a hard bargain.  How about this?  I’ll split the pizza with you, if you’ll do my homework.

Sybil:  You must really think I’m a sucker if you t hink I’d agree to that!

[end of dialogue]

Chris begins by saying to Sybil, “What are you doin g?  Let’s get into the hot lunch line.”  At most schools in the United States, the s chool gives students the opportunity – the option of buying their lunch, a h ot lunch cooked at the school. The school has a kitchen and a place where the stud ents can eat called a “cafeteria.”  My school, when I was growing up, did  not have a hot lunch program.  But this school, and most schools, do hav e them.

Chris says to Sybil, “Let’s get into the hot lunch line,” the line where people are waiting to get their food.  Sybil says, “See this l unchbox?  My mom made me brown-bag it today.”  A “lunchbox” is a small, usua lly metal or plastic box or container that put your food into.  When I was grow ing up, as I said, there was no hot lunch program so many kids, especially the smal ler children, had lunchboxes. These were metal; they often had pictures of cartoo ns or sports figures on them. I had one; I don’t remember what was on it.  But, l unchboxes were the way that you took your lunch to school.  The other way you c ould take your lunch is put it in a paper bag, a brown bag – I’m not sure why, but  the bags were always brown – and that is what Sybil is referring to.  In fact,  she’s using this as a verb; “to brown-bag it” means to bring your lunch – cold lunc h in a bag, not to buy lunch at school.

Sybil says her mother says that the lunches served at school aren’t nutritious enough.  “Nutritious” (nutritious) is another word for healthy, food that has vitamins, minerals, other good things, and not too much sugar, fat, or salt – all the things that taste good!  That’s a nutritious lu nch or a nutritious meal, and Sybil’s mother says that the lunches at school are not nutritious.  This has actually been a common complaint or problem in the United States, especially in the last few years.  People have been saying that w e need to change the lunch programs in our schools so that they serve more nut ritious food, because all the American kids are getting fat.  Well, maybe because  they are sitting at home playing video games.  Maybe it’s because their pare nts don’t let them go out

anymore on a bicycle unless they have the latest sa fety equipment on their head. I don’t know, but they are getting fatter.

Chris says, “That sucks.”  The expression “that suc ks” means that’s very bad or that’s very disappointing.  It’s a very informal te rm used by a lot of young people, not something you want to say to your boss, and it means that it’s very unfortunate or very sad.  Chris says, “What did she  (your mother) make you?” Sybil says, “A salad.”  Chris says, “Oh, gross.”  “ Gross” means disgusting, something that is very unpleasant, usually related to food but not always. Another informal term we might use is “yuck” or “yu cky.”  That’s the general idea. Chris says, “I really feel sorry for you.  What els e?” meaning what else did she make.  Sybil says, “Let me see.  There are some car rot sticks, too,” little carrots that are cut up.

Chris says, “Sucker!”  “Sucker” is a rude word used  to describe someone who has been tricked or manipulated or used by another person.  It’s definitely a negative description of someone; it’s saying that p erson is stupid, in a way, for being deceived, for being used or tricked.  Chris s ays, “You should have thrown a fit.”  “To throw a fit” means to get very angry, to  start yelling and screaming; it’s something you expect a little child to do.  In fact , when a child does it it’s sometimes called also a “temper tantrum.”  Chris sa ys, “I wouldn’t have taken it lying down.”  “To take (something) lying down” mean s to accept something without opposing or protesting it even though you’r e not very happy.  You don’t say anything, you just accept it.  That’s to take s omething lying down.  Chris says, “Listen to me.  You should ditch that lunch a nd buy lunch instead, like me,” like I am going to do.  “To ditch” (ditch) here mea ns to get rid of something, to throw something away.  “I’m going to ditch my old b oxes in the garage,” I’m going to throw them away.  We also use this verb in schoo ls, especially, to mean not to go to class when you are supposed to.  “I’m going t o ditch my chemistry class today,” I’m not going to go.  That’s what we used t o say, and that’s probably something I did when I was in school – ditch chemis try class, that is.  Not my favorite subject, if I’m being completely honest.

Chris says that Sybil should ditch her lunch, shoul d throw it away and buy lunch instead.  Sybil says, “I can’t.  I don’t have any l unch money,” any money you can use to buy lunch, of course.  She says, “Do you wan t to trade some of yours for mine?”  “To trade” means I give you something and y ou give me something else; we exchange it.  Chris responds by saying, “You’re dreaming.”  The expression “you’re dreaming” is an informal way of saying that  what the person just said or just suggested is completely unacceptable or silly.   It’s another way of saying “no way, absolutely not.”  “You’re dreaming.  There’s n o way I’m trading my pizza for

your salad and carrot sticks.”  So, Chris isn’t goi ng to give Sybil some pizza in order to get some salad and carrot sticks.

Then, Sybil tries to convince Chris to trade with h er.  She says, “Not even if I do your math homework?”  Sybil is offering to do Chris ’s math “homework,” what the teacher gave them as work to do at home, in exchang e for some of his pizza. Chris says, “Math homework?  Now you’ve got my atte ntion,” meaning okay, maybe this is something I will do; I’m now paying a ttention.  Sybil says, “Only if you give me the entire slice of pizza.”  A “slice” is a piece of something, a piece of food typically, cut from a larger portion or pie ce of food.  We use “slice” when we’re talking about bread; we use it when we’re tal king about cakes; we use it when we’re talking about pies, cheese, and sometime s meat.  “I want a slice of turkey on my sandwich, with a slice of cheese, on t wo slices of white bread.  For dessert, I’m going to have a slice of pie and two s lices of cake.”  Of course, here we’re talking about pizza, which is also a type of food we use this word “slice” (slice) with.

Chris says, “You drive a hard bargain.”  “To drive a hard bargain” means that you are good at negotiating something; you get a lot of  things when you negotiate, when you are trading with someone, when you are try ing to get someone to agree with you.  He says, “How about this?  I’ll sp lit the pizza with you, if you’ll do my homework.”  Chris is saying, “Well, I don’t want  to give you the entire slice of pizza; I’ll give you half of that.”  That’s what he  means by saying, “I’ll split the pizza with you.”  “To split” means to share it, eac h person gets half of it or some part of it.  “Split” has a couple of other meanings  in English; take a look at the wonderful Learning Guide for some more information.

Sybil then says, “You must really think I’m a sucke r if you think I’d agree to that!” She’s saying here that Chris must think she is stup id, that she’s a sucker, if he thinks that she will do his homework for only half a slice of pizza.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Chris:  What are you doing?  Let’s get into the hot  lunch line.

Sybil:  See this lunchbox?  My mom made me brown-ba g it today.  She says that the lunches served at school aren’t nutritious enou gh.

Chris:  That sucks.  What did she make you?

Sybil:  A salad.

Chris:  Oh, gross.  I really feel sorry for you.  W hat else?

Sybil:  Let me see.  There are some carrot sticks, too.

Chris:  Sucker!  You should have thrown a fit.  I w ouldn’t have taken it lying down.  Listen to me.  You should ditch that lunch a nd buy lunch instead, like me.

Sybil:  I can’t.  I don’t have any lunch money.  Do  you want to trade some of yours for mine?

Chris:  You’re dreaming.  There’s no way I’m tradin g my pizza for your salad and carrot sticks.

Sybil:  Not even if I do your math homework?

Chris:  Math homework?  Now you’ve got my attention .

Sybil:  Only if you give me the entire slice of piz za.

Chris:  You drive a hard bargain.  How about this?  I’ll split the pizza with you, if you’ll do my homework.

Sybil:  You must really think I’m a sucker if you t hink I’d agree to that!

# Making Ethnically or Racially Offensive Remarks

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast epi sode 698: Making Ethnically or Racially Offensive Remarks.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 698.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode to improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Making Ethnically or Racial ly Offensive Remarks.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mike:  Did you hear what Dan said?  He called me a mick.  What decade is he living in?

Patti:  He’s just ignorant.  I’m sure he wasn’t try ing to be offensive.

Mike:  Well, I take offense.  And to add insult to injury, did you hear what else he said?

Patti:  What?

Mike:  He said that he was speaking on behalf of the Irish in the community when he said he liked the plan.  How dare he speak for o ther people?  It’s presumptuous.

Patti:  He was trying to make a point and probably just got carried away.  I agree that what he said could be insulting, but let’s giv e him the benefit of the doubt.

Mike:  You can be magnanimous if you want to be, bu t I know an ethnic slur when I hear one.

Patti:  It wasn’t an ethnic slur.  It wasn’t the po litically correct term, that’s all.  He’s a little behind the times.

Mike:  Behind the times?!  He’d have to live to 150  to catch up to the present!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Mike saying to Patti, “Did  you hear what Dan said?  He called me a mick.”  A “mick” (mick) is an old term for someone who was from Ireland or had relatives from Ireland.  It is an in sulting term, what we would call a “derogatory” term.  It is not a compliment, but an insult to someone.  There are many, as you probably know, words that are used to describe people from different countries, different ethnicities, as well  as different races: white, black, Asian, and so forth.  We’re not going to go over th ose here on the podcast other than to use this one as an example.  A “mick” was s omeone who, as I said, was Irish.

Mike continues, “What decade is he (is Dan) living in?”  A “decade” is a period of 10 years.  If someone says, “In the past decade we have had many good things happen at our company,” they mean in the past 10 ye ars.  Decade is related to 10; usually it refers to 10 years, but it can refer  to 10 other things as well.

Patti says, “He’s just ignorant,” he doesn’t have t he knowledge of something, he was never taught some particular thing.  When you s ay someone is “ignorant,” you say they don’t know something.  They’re not nec essarily a bad person, they just don’t know.  Patti says, “I’m sure he wasn’t t rying to be offensive.”  “To be offensive” here means to be insulting, to be rude, to try to hurt someone else’s feelings.

Mike says, “Well, I take offense.”  “To take offens e” says that you are bothered by – you are offended by something someone did or s aid.  Mike says, “And to add insult to injury, did you hear what else he sai d?”  The expression “to add insult to injury” means to make a bad situation wor se, to do something to make a situation more negative that was already a negative  situation or a bad situation.

Patti says, “What?”  Mike says, “He said that he wa s speaking on behalf of the Irish in the community.”  “On behalf of” means repr esenting someone else or some group of people.  “I’m speaking on behalf of e veryone in my family when I say thank you for all the help you have given us.”  I’m speaking on behalf of them; they’re not speaking, I’m speaking for them –  on behalf of.  Mike says that Dan said he was “speaking on behalf of the Irish in  the community when he said he liked the plan.  How dare he speak for other peo ple?”  The expression “how dare you” or “how dare she” is the beginning of a q uestion you ask when you are angry at what someone has said; you think what they  said or did was wrong. Often, the expression is used when you think that p erson has somehow done more than they had the right to do.  “How dare you throw water at my cat when he was in your backyard.”  He was in your house, ho w dare you?  You don’t have

a right to do that, that’s what you’re saying.  You ’re wrong, but that’s what you’re saying!

Mike says how dare Dan speak for other people.  He says, “It’s presumptuous.” “To be presumptuous” (presumptuous) means doing som ething that is wrong, that is inappropriate, because, once again, you don ’t have the right to do it. You’re assuming that you can do something when, in fact, you should not be doing it.  So you walk into a bar and you start tal king to this beautiful woman, and about halfway through your conversation you give he r your phone number and you say, “Well, let’s meet next Friday for a drink.   Give me a call,” that would be presumptuous; the verb would be “to presume.”  You are presuming that the woman is interested in you and wants to go on a dat e with you.  That would be very presumptuous, probably not very successfully e ither!

Patti says Dan “was trying to make a point.”  “To m ake a point” is an expression that means to do something to demonstrate or prove something else.  It’s often used simply to mean to make a statement or a strong  statement, and sometimes you can add the preposition “of” at the end when yo u want to say that you specifically and purposely did something.  For exam ple: “I want to make a point of arriving at work on time every day this week.”  You are planning on doing it, probably because you want to prove something or dem onstrate something, or simply because you think it’s important.  Patti say s Dan was trying to say something important, “to make a point and probably just got carried away.”  “To get carried away” means to be so excited, so enthus iastic about doing something that you do too much of it; you don’t realize you’r e doing too much.  To go back to our example at the bar, if the woman actually do es call you, and you decide that you’re going to buy her a dozen roses and a bo ttle of champagne and get a special car – a limousine to pick you up together a t this restaurant, you go to the best restaurant in the city, you might be getting c arried away.  You might be doing too much – especially if it’s just your first  date!  If you bought her a ring, to marry her, you would definitely be getting carried away.

Patti says, “I agree that what he said could be ins ulting (could hurt someone’s feelings), but let’s give him the benefit of the do ubt.”  “To give (someone) the benefit of the doubt” is to assume that what someon e said or did, they did for a good reason; they had good intentions even though t he result was negative. When you’re not sure why someone did something, and  it seems like something bad happened, you can give them the benefit of the doubt; you can say, “Well, they probably didn’t realize they were talking so l oudly on their cell phone in the café yesterday.”  So, you’re not going to get angry  at them, you’re going to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps there’s som ething they didn’t understand

or you didn’t understand about the situation that w ould give it a different meaning.

Mike says, “You can be magnanimous if you want to b e.”  “To be magnanimous” is to be very kind, very forgiving, very generous.  “The businesswoman gave a million dollars to her old university.  It was a ma gnanimous gift,” a generous one. Mike says, “I know an ethnic slur when I hear one.”   A “slur” (slur) is an insulting term or word, sort of like a swear word, but usuall y it’s directed at a person. You’re saying something about that person.  An “eth nic slur” would be like the term “mick,” an insulting term about someone from a  particular group or country. A “racial slur” would be about someone’s skin color .

Patti says, “It wasn’t an ethnic slur.  It wasn’t t he politically correct term, that’s all.”  “Politically correct” is using words and lan guage carefully so that you don’t offend other people – to get other people mad at yo u.  You often will change the words that we perhaps used to use to describe someo ne and use language that is less offensive to them.  Some people use “politi cally correct” itself to be an insulting term, saying that people are being too ca reful not to be offensive.  In any case, Patti says that Dan is “a little behind t he times.”  “To be behind the times” is to be old-fashioned, to be outdated; some one who’s not necessarily modern, who is not doing things appropriate for the  current times – the current day.

Mike says, “Behind the times?!  He’d have to live t o 150 to catch up to the present!”  “To catch up” is a two-word phrasal verb  meaning to reach the same position or place or level as other people are.  If  you are in school and you don’t go to class for two weeks, you’ll have to catch up to the other students.  You’ll have to work to get to the same level they are at.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mike:  Did you hear what Dan said?  He called me a mick.  What decade is he living in?

Patti:  He’s just ignorant.  I’m sure he wasn’t try ing to be offensive.

Mike:  Well, I take offense.  And to add insult to injury, did you hear what else he said?

Patti:  What?

 Mike:  He said that he was speaking on behalf of the Irish in the community when he said he liked the plan.  How dare he speak for o ther people?  It’s presumptuous.

Patti:  He was trying to make a point and probably just got carried away.  I agree that what he said could be insulting, but let’s giv e him the benefit of the doubt.

Mike:  You can be magnanimous if you want to be, bu t I know an ethnic slur when I hear one.

Patti:  It wasn’t an ethnic slur.  It wasn’t the po litically correct term, that’s all.  He’s a little behind the times.

Mike:  Behind the times?!  He’d have to live to 150  to catch up to the present!

# Dealing With the Paparazzi

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 699: Dealing With the Paparazzi.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 699.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  Go there to downl oad a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English eve n faster.

This episode is called “Dealing With the Paparazzi, ” these are photographers who try to take pictures of famous people.  Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Fredo:  I feel like a prisoner in my own home!  I c an’t step outside without the paparazzi snapping pictures of me.  They stake out my house 24 hours a day.

Amanda:  I suppose that’s the price of fame.  You d o have the most popular podcast in the world.

Fredo:  But they’re such a pain in the neck!  They don’t just take pictures.  They chase me in my car and follow me into restrooms, tr ying to corner me.  It’s an invasion of privacy.

Amanda:  You’re right, but look on the bright side.   The paparazzi give you plenty of exposure.  They keep your name – and your face –  in the spotlight.

Fredo:  It would be fine if they just took a few ca ndid shots while I’m at dinner or at the store, but they try to take photos when I’m out of town, trying to catch me doing something I shouldn’t.

Amanda:  At least, that’s good news for your wife.  She can call off that private detective she hired to follow you from city to city !

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Fredo saying to Amanda, “I  feel like a prisoner in my own home!”  A “prisoner” is someone who is in priso n, which is the same as jail, when the government – the police arrest you and kee p you in a building that’s

called the “prison,” and you are a prisoner.  Fredo  says he feels like a prisoner in his own home.  “I can’t step outside (meaning I can ’t go outside my house) without the paparazzi snapping pictures of me.”  the “paparazzi” (paparazzi) are photographers who try to take pictures of famous pe ople and sell them to newspapers and magazines.  The paparazzi are snappi ng pictures of Fredo.  “To snap” (snap) here means to take a photograph, to us e a camera to take a picture.  You can say “I’m going to take a picture, ” or you could say “I’m going to snap a picture,” they mean the same thing.  “Snap” also is the sound that you make with your fingers when you put them together q uickly, like this [Jeff snaps his fingers], that’s also “to snap.”  Fredo said, “ They stake out my house 24 hours a day.”  “To stake (stake) out” is a two-word phras al verb meaning to watch some place or some person in a hidden, secret way.  You’ re trying to observe what this person is doing without the person knowing that you  are watching.

Amanda says, “I suppose that’s the price of fame.”  “The price of fame” or “being famous” are the disadvantages or negative consequen ces of being famous.  You have a lot of advantages, but you also have disadva ntages.  The disadvantages constitute or make up the price of fame.  Amanda sa ys, “You do have the most popular podcast in the world.”  Fredo says, “But th ey’re,” meaning the paparazzi, “they’re such a pain in the neck!”  “To be a pain i n the neck” means someone or something is bothering you, is annoying you, is mak ing you very uncomfortable. “My boss is a pain in the neck.”  That means he ann oys me, he makes me mad, he upsets me, he gives me a lot of trouble.  “Pain in the neck” is the nice way of saying it; some people might also say “pain in the butt” (butt).  Your “butt,” of course, is what you sit on, and other people use ot her words for “butt” that we won’t mention here on the podcast.  “Pain in the ne ck,” then, is an informal expression, meaning someone or something that is an noying.

Fredo says, “They don’t just take pictures (these p aparazzi).  They chase me in my car and follow me into restrooms.”  “To chase” ( chase) means to follow someone, usually in their car, but it could be ridi ng a bicycle or running after you. The person is usually moving very fast trying to ca tch you, trying to get you before you leave.  Fredo says that the paparazzi ch ase him in his car and follow him into “restrooms,” or bathrooms, trying to corne r him.  “To corner (someone)” means to put someone in a position where that perso n can’t leave because there’s nowhere else to go.  You could do that phys ically, you could corner someone, make sure that they can’t leave.  Usually you do that when you want to talk to them or do something they don’t want to do.   You can also corner someone in a more general sense of not giving them very many options, limiting their ability to do other things that you don’t wan t them to do.

Fredo says, “It’s an invasion of privacy.”  “Privac y” is related to the word “private,” which means secret, hidden, other people don’t know  about what you want to keep secret or keep hidden.  Sometimes people say, “I’m a very private person,” meaning they don’t like to talk about their persona l life with other people.  The word “invasion” (invasion) is usually when some gro up of soldiers, people in the military – the army, the navy – go into some place and take it over.  But here, “invasion of privacy” means someone is going into y our private life, is finding out about things that they have no right to know.

Amanda says, “You’re right, but look on the bright side.”  “To look on the bright side” is an expression meaning to see the advantage s of what may seem like a bad situation, to be positive, to be optimistic.  I f you lose your girlfriend or your boyfriend, you should always look on the bright sid e; there are other men and women out there in the world for you.  Or, if someo ne steals your car, you have to look on the bright side; you will now get more e xercise by walking!  See, there’s always a positive thing that can be said of  a negative situation.

Amanda says, “The paparazzi give you plenty of expo sure.  They keep your name – and your face – in the spotlight.”  “To be i n the spotlight” means to get a lot of attention from other people, the newspapers and the television programs for example.  That’s to be in the spotlight, to get  a lot of attention.

Fredo says, “It would be fine (it would be okay) if  they just took a few candid shots while I’m at dinner or at the store.”  “Candi d” (candid) can mean very honest, but when we’re talking about photography it ’s a picture of someone who isn’t posing for the picture; they’re not looking a  certain way or smiling a certain way.  A candid photograph is one where typically yo u don’t even know that you’re being photographed, or you don’t act any different because you are being photographed.  A “shot” is another word for a pictu re, so “candid shots” would be pictures of someone who doesn’t know they’re being photographed or doesn’t care – doesn’t act any differently.

Fredo says that the paparazzi try to take photograp hs of him when he’s “out of town,” meaning visiting another city, “trying to ca tch me doing something I shouldn’t.”  “To catch (someone)” means to watch th em and find out what they’re doing that might be wrong, usually something they’r e trying to hide or keep secret.  “The teacher caught one of her students ch eating.”  “Caught” is the past tense of “catch.”  Or you could say, “The father ca ught his daughter talking on the phone late at night,” she wasn’t supposed to, she w as supposed be sleeping. The father caught her.  Fredo says that the paparaz zi are trying to catch him doing something wrong, doing something he shouldn’t  do.

Amanda says, “At least, that’s good news for your w ife.  She can call off that private detective she hired to follow you from city  to city!”  “To call off” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to end something, to canc el, to abandon, to tell someone you don’t need them to continue doing what they were doing.  If you have dogs to protect you in your house and they sta rt to chase someone who is coming to your house – they start to go after them – the person may yell, “Call off your dogs,” meaning tell your dogs to stop attackin g me.  “Call off” is often used for investigations or searches.  “The police called  off their search for the missing dog,” they stopped looking for the dog.  Why were t hey looking for the dog?  I don’t know.  Or you could say, “The baseball game w as called off last night because of rain,” it was canceled.  Or, “The man ca lled off his wedding,” he decided he wasn’t going to marry the woman he said he was going to marry. That’s not very nice!

Amanda says that the wife of Fredo can call off tha t private detective she hired. A “private detective” is someone whose job it is to  find out secret information about you, usually by taking pictures of what you a re doing.  This is something a wife might do if she thinks her husband is going wi th another woman; she may hire, or employ, a private detective to follow him.   Amanda is making a joke, of course, saying that because the paparazzi are alway s taking pictures of Fredo, his wife doesn’t have to worry about him going with  another woman, we would say “cheating on her,” because they will find out i f he does.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Fredo:  I feel like a prisoner in my own home!  I c an’t step outside without the paparazzi snapping pictures of me.  They stake out my house 24 hours a day.

Amanda:  I suppose that’s the price of fame.  You d o have the most popular podcast in the world.

Fredo:  But they’re such a pain in the neck!  They don’t just take pictures.  They chase me in my car and follow me into restrooms, tr ying to corner me.  It’s an invasion of privacy.

# Starting a New Workweek

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 700: Starting a New Workweek.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 700.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you, as we have for the l ast 699 episodes, from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los  Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Download a Learning Gui de for this episode, and help support ESL Podcast by becoming a member.  Mor e information is on our website.

This episode is called “Starting a New Workweek.”  It’s a dialogue between Naomi and Aaron.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Naomi:  Wow, you look like you had a rough weekend.   A little too much partying, huh?

Aaron:  You said it.  I’m planning to ease into the  new workweek.  I need time to chill and to recover.  Could you take a meeting thi s morning with our new client?

Naomi:  What will you do?

Aaron:  I’ll be sitting here waiting for hump day.  The weekend can’t come soon enough!

Naomi:  It’s Monday and you’re already looking forw ard to next weekend?

Aaron:  You got it.

Naomi:  And you want to slack off, while I take on the lion’s share of your work. Is that what you’re saying?

Aaron:  Just this once.  I’ll return the favor the next time you have a rough weekend.

Naomi:  What are you planning for next weekend?

Aaron:  Why do you ask?

 Naomi:  I want to know how long I’ll have to wait f or a chance to sit back and watch you work!

[end of dialogue]

Naomi begins by saying to Aaron, “Wow, you look lik e you had a rough weekend.”  “Rough” (rough) here means difficult, or  not easy.  There are some other meanings of “rough,” which can be found in the Learning Guide for this episode.  Naomi says Aaron had a rough weekend.  the “weekend” is typically Saturday and Sunday.  Some people will talk about a  “three-day weekend,” that’s usually Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, when you don’ t have to work for a holiday.  Normally, the weekend is Saturday and Sun day, with some people including Friday night.

Naomi says, “A little too much partying, huh?”  The  “huh” – (huh) is how it is generally spelled – is a noise that you may make at  the end of a statement to make it into a question; it’s an informal way of ma king something into a question. Naomi says, “A little too much partying.”  “To part y,” as a verb, means to go to exciting parties, to spend a lot of time with other  people, usually drinking a lot of alcohol and such.

Aaron says, “You said it.”  The phrase “you said it ” means you are exactly correct, or what you just said is right, or I agree  completely with what you said. You might say, “English can be so confusing,” and y our friend would say, “You said it,” meaning that’s right, that’s correct.  It ’s not confusing, of course; that’s why you have ESL Podcast!

Aaron says, “I’m planning to ease into the new work week.”  “To ease (ease) into (something)” means to begins something slowly, grad ually, not try to do everything at full energy or using all of your ener gy to begin to do something. You’re going to start slowly, easily; that’s to eas e into something.  A “workweek,” which is the word “work” plus the word “week” made into a single word, is the days of the week you have to work, typically Monday  through Friday – Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  That’s f or most people their workweek.

Aaron says, “I need time to chill and recover.”  “T o chill” as a verb here means to relax, not to do or think about anything serious or  important.  It’s an informal verb, or informal way of using this verb to mean relax.  “I need time to chill.” Sometimes if you are very excited and someone wants  you to calm down, they might use this as a command: “Hey, chill!” meaning take it easy; again, very

informally.  Aaron says he needs time to chill and to “recover,” to get better from the weekend so he feels better.  He says, “Could yo u take a meeting this morning with our new client?”  “To take a meeting” means to go to a group of people who are sitting down and talking to each oth er about something, to go to a meeting – to take a meeting.  Aaron wants Naomi t o take a meeting with their new “client,” their new customer.

Naomi says, “What will you do?”  Aaron says, “I’ll be sitting here waiting for hump day.”  “Hump day” is Wednesday, the middle of the w eek.  The idea is that during the first part of the week you’re going up a hill, or a hump, and the second part of the week you’re going down.  A “hump” is something you would find on a camel for example, the animal that survives in the desert .  So, “hump day” is Wednesday.  Aaron is basically saying he’s not goin g to do any work or very much work.  Aaron says, “The weekend can’t come soo n enough!”  The expression “can’t come soon enough” means that you are very eager for something to happen, you are looking forward to som ething, you hope that it happens soon, or that time will go by quickly so th at this thing can happen. Aaron is someone who doesn’t want to work, and is j ust waiting for the workweek to end so he can continue partying on the weekend.

Naomi says, “It’s Monday and you’re already looking  forward to next weekend?” Aaron says, “You got it.”  “You got it” means that you are correct, you are 100 percent correct.  It’s similar to “you said it,” al though we usually use the phrase “you said it” when we are complaining about somethi ng or talking about the negative aspects of something.  “You got it” could be used in probably more situations than “you said it.”  Here, Aaron says, “ You got it,” meaning that’s correct, that’s exactly right.

Naomi says, “And you want to slack off.”  “To slack  (slack) off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to relax, to be lazy, not to d o your job the way you should do it.  Someone who slacks off a lot is called a “s lacker.”  It’s a term meaning someone who is lazy, who doesn’t work very much or very hard; it’s an informal expression.  Naomi says, “you want to slack off (Aa ron), while I take on the lion’s share of your work.”  “To take on” means to do, to begin a new project.  “The lion’s share” means the majority of something, more  than 50 percent, the greater or larger part of something.  We often use it when talking about work.  “He has the lion’s share of the work,” he’s doing most of t he work for that project.

Naomi says that Aaron wants her to take on the lion ’s share of his work.  “Is that what you’re saying?” she asks.  Aaron says, “Just t his once.”  “Just this once” means only one time, this will never happen again, I will never ask you to do this again – just this once.  He says, “I’ll return the favor the next time you have a

rough weekend.”  “To return the favor” means to do something nice for someone who has done something nice for you.

Naomi then says, “What are you planning for next we ekend?”  What are you going to do next weekend?  Aaron says, “Why do you ask?” meaning why are you asking me.  Naomi says, “I want to know how lon g I’ll have to wait for a chance to sit back and watch you work!”  “To sit ba ck” means to observe something from a distance without participating, wi thout becoming involved, to see how something is done without affecting it.  It ’s sometimes used when someone else is working or you don’t have to work, you can relax a little.  But more generally, it means to watch something without  getting involved.  So, what Naomi is saying at the end here is that she wants t o know when she can watch Aaron work, and she’s suggesting it would be a very  long time before she can do that since Aaron seems to go out partying every wee kend.  That’s why she asks what Aaron plans to do the following weekend.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Naomi:  Wow, you look like you had a rough weekend.   A little too much partying, huh?

Aaron:  You said it.  I’m planning to ease into the  new workweek.  I need time to chill and to recover.  Could you take a meeting thi s morning with our new client?

Naomi:  What will you do?

Aaron:  I’ll be sitting here waiting for hump day.  The weekend can’t come soon enough!

Naomi:  It’s Monday and you’re already looking forw ard to next weekend?

Aaron:  You got it.

Naomi:  And you want to slack off, while I take on the lion’s share of your work. Is that what you’re saying?

Aaron:  Just this once.  I’ll return the favor the next time you have a rough weekend.

Naomi:  What are you planning for next weekend?

 Aaron:  Why do you ask?

Naomi:  I want to know how long I’ll have to wait f or a chance to sit back and watch you work!
