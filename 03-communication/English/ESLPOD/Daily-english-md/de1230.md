This episode is a dialogue between Donald and Hilar y about not liking the people who are elected to government positions. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hilary: Which candidate are you going to vote for i n the upcoming election?

Donald: Neither one. I’m not voting.

Hilary: What? You have to vote. Don’t you want to make your voice heard?

Donald: Neither candidate represents my views. They  each have their own political agendas that reflect the concerns of the elite, not people like you and me.

Hilary: To me, voter apathy is the real problem. Th ings won’t change if we don’t vote.

Donald: You’re not listening. Both candidates are i n the pockets of special interest groups and only care about pork-barrel pol itics. They’re not really concerned about the everyday challenges that you an d I face.

Hilary: That’s not true. Look at the platforms of e ach candidate. They each stand for different things.

Donald: That’s just lip service. They’ll say whatev er matches public opinion to get elected. No matter who gets into office, things wil l stay the same for regular folks like you and me.

Hilary: So you’re really not going to vote?

Donald: Nope.

Hilary: What do you hope to achieve?

Donald: Consider it a silent protest by the disaffe cted.

Hilary begins by asking Donald, “Which candidate are you going to vote for in the upcoming election?” A “candidate” (candidate) is a person who is trying to get elected to a certain position, often a position in government, such as president or governor or senator. Hilary is asking Donald which candidate he’s going to “vote” (vote) for. “To vote” means to indicate which perso n you want to win an election or which position you are taking on some matter tha t you are being asked to vote on.

We normally vote for people, but in some states suc h as California, there are laws that you also vote on directly. Most of our la ws are voted on, or voted for, by our representatives. We vote for people who then vo te for laws, but in some cases, we vote directly on certain laws. Hilary is talking about candidates for whom Donald might vote in the “upcoming,” or soon-t o-take-place, “election.” An “election” (election) is a period when people vote.

Elections typically take place on one day, although  that isn’t always true. Sometimes you will have voting taking place over a couple of different days. More commonly now, people can vote by mail. So, you  can start voting even before the day of the election, when people actuall y go to a place in their neighborhood and vote. Just by coincidence – just b y chance – I’m recording this today, which is an Election Day in California, but I’m not going to vote today because I voted by mail last week. I sent in my “ba llot” (ballot). Your “ballot” is the piece of paper you use to vote.

Donald says, “Neither one. I’m not voting,” meaning  he’s not going to vote for either of the two candidates who are, we would say,  “running for office” – trying to get elected. In the U.S., there are two large impor tant political parties – the Democrats and the Republicans. In most elections, t here are two candidates – a Democrat and a Republican. That isn’t always true, but it’s often true.

Hilary says, “What? You have to vote.” Donald says he’s not going to vote and Hilary says he has to vote. She says, “Don’t you wa nt to make your voice

heard?” The expression “to make your voice (voice) heard” means to give your opinion in a way that makes other people know what you think. Donald says, however, “Neither candidate represents my views.” “ To represent” here means to have the same opinions that you have. Donald contin ues, “These two candidates each have their own political agendas that reflect the concerns of the elite, not people like you and me.”

A “political agenda” (agenda) is a list or a set of  ideas that you believe in, especially if you are someone in government. It’s a  list of things or a set of beliefs that you want to put into place or put into action.  “To reflect” here means the same as “to represent.” “To reflect” (reflect) mean s to be very similar to, in this case, your ideas, but Donald says that these candid ates don’t represent his ideas or his concerns, but rather the concerns or the thi ngs that are important to the “elite” (elite). “The elite” refers to the people i n a society who have the most money and the most power.

Hilary says, “To me, voter apathy is the real probl em. Things won’t change if we don’t vote.” “Apathy” (apathy) means a lack of inte rest or not being very enthusiastic or interested in doing something or pa rticipating in something. “Voter apathy” refers to the fact that some people don’t want to vote or are simply not interested in voting. Some people think this is bad  – Hilary, for example. I’m not so sure.

You may not be interested in voting because you thi nk everything is going fine in the world, or you may not be interested in voting b ecause you don’t think voting will make a difference. Sometimes that’s true. Some times it isn’t. I don’t know of any evidence that shows that the more people vote, the better government we get. Maybe if you aren’t interested in voting, it’s  because you haven’t been educating yourself and therefore don’t feel you sho uld vote, which in my opinion is a good reason not to vote. But many people disag ree with me, including Hilary.

Hilary says, “Things won’t change if we don’t vote. ” Donald says, “You’re not listening. Both candidates are in the pockets of sp ecial interest groups and only care about pork-barrel politics.” The expression “t o be in the pockets” (pockets) of someone means you are being influenced or contro lled by another person or group, probably because that person is giving you m oney. “Special interest groups” are organizations that try to influence gov ernment – groups that try to get their ideas adopted or put into action by the gover nment.

The term “pork (pork) – barrel (barrel) politics,” sometimes spelled without the hyphen between “pork” and “barrel,” refers to using  money to make a certain group of voters happy in order to get those voters to vote for a certain party or a

certain person. So, for example, if I’m a politicia n who has been elected to a government position, I might give money to certain groups or to certain people so that those people will vote for me in the future. Y es, this really happens all over the world, and probably in all periods of history.

Donald is complaining that these candidates only ca re about “pork-barrel politics,” meaning they don’t care about everyone, just about certain voters whom they’re trying to influence by giving them money. O f course, you can’t give voters money directly in exchange for them voting for you.  You do it in other ways. Donald says the candidates “are not really concerne d about the everyday challenges,” the day-to-day problems that people li ke Donald and Hilary face.

Hilary says, “That’s not true. Look at the platform s of each candidate.” A “platform” (platform), in the world of politics, re fers to a list of positions or ideas that a certain candidate or political party believe s in or stands for. In the U.S., every four years the two major political parties si t down and write their “platform” – the ideas that they believe in or the laws that t hey want to pass or get rid of. Hilary says that each candidate stands for differen t things. “To stand for” means to believe in, to take a position for or against a certain policy or idea.

Donald, however, disagrees. He says, “That’s just l ip (lip) service.” “Lip service” is a phrase we use to describe support or belief in  something that isn’t really sincere or that doesn’t represent any sort of actio n. Someone can say they’re for the environment, or they’re for doing something abo ut the economy, but they don’t actually do anything. To say something – that  you believe in something – but not to do anything about it is an example of “l ip service,” or “giving lip service,” we might also say.

Donald says, “These candidates say whatever matches  public opinion to get elected.” “Public opinion” refers to what people be lieve, what the majority of people believe. Donald says, “No matter who gets in to office,” meaning it doesn’t matter who gets elected, “things will stay the same  for regular folks like you and me.” “Regular folks” (folks) means normal people, o rdinary people, people like you and I. “No matter who gets into office,” Donald  says, “things will stay the same,” meaning things won’t change, “for regular folks.”

Hilary then asks, “So you’re really not going to vo te?” Donald responds, “Nope” (nope). “Nope” means no. It’s an informal way of sa ying no. Hilary says, “What do you hope to achieve?” meaning “What are you trying to accomplish by not voting?” Donald says, “Consider it a silent protest  by the disaffected.” A “protest” (protest) is some action that shows your disapprova l or disappointment in

someone or something. A “silent protest” would be n ot speaking or not doing something as a way of showing you are in disagreeme nt about something with another person or group.

“Disaffected” (disaffected) is an adjective used to  describe people who are not happy about the people who are in power, such as po liticians, and don’t want to support them in any way. People who are “disaffecte d” may be people who don’t vote, for example, because they are angry at everyo ne who is part of the political process. Please note that the names used in this di alogue do not represent any real people, especially not candidates for the pres idency of the United States.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

If there were an election for the best scriptwriter  on the internet, I’m quite sure the winner would be the one, the only, Dr. Lucy Tse.
