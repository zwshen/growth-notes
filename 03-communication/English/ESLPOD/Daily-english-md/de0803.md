This episode is called “Negotiating a Peace Treaty. ”  A “treaty,” an agreement between two different countries.  Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Ahmed:  Have you heard the news?

Menna:  The nations of Palicia and Isram have signe d a peace treaty.  This means that there will be an immediate ceasefire and  an end to hostilities.  This is a historic day!

Ahmed:  I never thought I’d live to see this day.  Has everything been settled?

Menna:  Only the most important things.  The border s have been decided, there will be a recognition of statehood, and political p risoners will be exchanged.

Ahmed:  That’s great, but does the treaty need to b e ratified by the people of the two nations?

Menna:  Yes, but the leaders have already signed the documents and the ratification process is just a formality at this po int.

Ahmed:  This means that refugees will be able to re turn home.

Menna:  That’s right.  They’ll be able to go home a t long last.

Ahmed:  This is a banner day for world peace, don’t  you think?

Menna:  Yes, and in that spirit, why don’t you call  Hanna and invite her over for dinner?  You two haven’t spoken in weeks.

Ahmed:  It’s not going to be that easy.  A peace tr eaty with my sister will require a formal apology and reparations!

[end of dialogue]

Ahmed begins our dialogue by saying to Menna, “Have  you heard the news?” Menna says, “The nations of Palicia and Isram have signed a peace treaty.”  The “nations” mean the countries.  We use “country” and  “nation” often to mean the same thing in English.  These two countries – these  two nations have signed a peace treaty.  A “treaty” is an official agreement between two governments usually.  A “peace treaty” would be when two govern ments are fighting – when two countries are fighting and you want to end the war – end the fighting, you might have a peace treaty.  Menna says, “This means  that there will be an immediate ceasefire and an end to hostilities.”  A “ceasefire” (ceasefire – one word) is an agreement to stop shooting at each othe r, to stop sending bombs over to the other country.  “To fire” can also mean  to shoot, like a weapon – like a gun.  “To cease” means to stop.  So, a “ceasefire” is when you stop firing; you stop shooting each other.  Menna says that the peac e treaty will make it so that there is an immediate ceasefire and an end to hosti lities.  “Hostilities” are the same as fighting; “acts of war” we might call them.   Menna says, “This is an historic day!”  “Historic” (historic) means somethi ng you will remember for a very long time, something that will be remembered in the  future.  Of course, you can’t remember it in the past, so…!  Anyway, “historic” i s something very memorable, something that many people will talk about years an d years from now.

Ahmed says, “I never thought I’d live to see this d ay.  Has everything been settled?”  When we say something has been “settled”  (settled) we mean it’s been agreed upon or it’s been decided; all of the detail s, all of the small arrangements have been made.

Menna says, “Only the most important things,” meani ng not everything has been settled, but the most important things have; they’v e agreed on the most important things.  “The borders have been decided, there will  be a recognition of statehood, and political prisoners will be exchanged.”  “Borde rs” are lines that separate two countries.  They’re not real lines, we would call t hem imaginary lines that separate two different areas or two different count ries.  We can talk about borders between two states or two regions as well.  “The borders,” Menna says, “have been decided (they decided where that line is  going to be), there will be a recognition of statehood.”  “Statehood” is when you  say the other people, the

people who are living in this area are officially a  country.  So, to “recognize” that is to say officially “okay, yes, you are a separate  country.”  This often happens when one part of a country doesn’t want to be part of the rest of the country and they will often want to separate themselves and hav e their own nation – their own state.  Here, “state” means the same as “country.”  “State” can also be part of a country, like the United States has 50 states withi n one country, but we can also refer to an entire nation as a state.  Menna says, “political prisoners will be exchanged.”  A “prisoner” is someone who’s been arr ested and put in jail – put into a prison.  A “political prisoner” is someone w ho is arrested because of their political beliefs.  They didn’t steal anything, the y didn’t kill anyone, but because the government doesn’t like their opinion they put them in prison; we call those “political prisoners.”

Ahmed says, “That’s great, but does the treaty need  to be ratified by the people of the two nations?”  “To be ratified,” or simply “ to ratify” (ratify) means to agree officially to do something, to approve something.  In the United States, for example, where there’s a treaty between two differe nt countries – the United States and, say, Canada – the president of the Unit ed States has to say, “yes, I agree,” but the treaty needs to be ratified by anot her part of the U.S. government, the United States Senate, which is part of the grou p of people who are our elected representatives.  So, that’s an example of “ratification.”  Ahmed is saying or asking if the treaty needs to be ratified by the  people who live in these two different states – these two different countries.

Menna says, “Yes, but the leaders have already sign ed the documents and the ratification process is just a formality at this po int.”  When we talk about “formalities” (formalities) we’re referring to thin gs that have to be done according to the rules, but that are not important difficulti es or things that we can’t solve. There are things that need to be done, but it isn’t  something that’s going to get in the way of or stop this thing from happening.

Ahmed said, “This means that refugees will be able to return home.”  “Refugees” (refugees) are people who have to leave their count ry, usually because it’s too dangerous for them there, and want to return back t o their country some day. Typically, refugees have to leave during a war or b ecause of some sort of political problem, otherwise it may be too dangerou s for them and so they leave. But in this case, the refugees will be able to go b ack home because of this peace treaty.

Menna says, “That’s right.  They’ll be able to go h ome at long last.”  The expression “at long last” simply means finally, aft er a long period of time.  Ahmed says, “This is a banner day for world peace, don’t you think?”  A “banner (banner)

day” is an important day, a day that we might say i s historic, or a day that is very important.  Sometimes we talk about a “banner day” to refer to someone who has done something better than they have ever done it b efore on that day, or this is a day when that sort of thing has been done better th an it has before.  “It was a banner day for the stock market.”  That means it wa s a very good day.  A “banner day” is always a good thing.  “Banner” has a couple  of other meanings in English as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for thos e.

Ahmed thinks this is a banner day for world peace, for the idea that there will be no war or fighting anywhere on earth.  Menna says, “Yes (this is a banner day for world peace), and in that spirit, why don’t you cal l Hanna and invite her over for dinner?”  The expression “in that spirit” is used w hen we are going to introduce another topic, but it’s related to what we’ve been talking about already.  So, “in that spirit” here means since we’ve been talking ab out peace and world peace and people getting along again, Menna suggests to A hmed that he call Hanna and invite her over for dinner.  She says, “You two  haven’t spoken in weeks.” Often when you say two people haven’t spoken we mea n they haven’t spoken to each other because they’ve been angry at each other  or mad at each other.

Ahmed says, “It’s not going to be that easy.”  It’s  not going to be easy just to call her and invite her over; there may be some more dif ficult things they have to resolve first.  He says, “A peace treaty with my si ster will require a formal apology and reparations!”  An “apology” is when you tell so meone that you’re sorry, you did something wrong.  A “formal apology” might be a  written apology – an official apology.  We don’t normally use that expression in talking about two different people or two members of a family, so Ahmed is bein g a little humorous here. What he’s saying is that it’s going to be very diff icult because his sister, if I understand him correctly, needs to give him an apol ogy; he thinks his sister did something wrong.  He also says his sister has to gi ve him reparations. “Reparations” (reparations) is when one country bea ts another country – defeats another country in a war, and as part of the treaty  one country, the losing country, has to give some sort of money or somethin g of value to make up for what they did wrong, make up for the fact that they  were fighting this war. Reparations can also be something that a government  may give a group of people for having injured them or hurt them, usuall y it is an amount of money that has to be given.  Well, Ahmed thinks his sister nee ds to give him reparations, so obviously they are going to have a difficult time m aking peace with each other.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
