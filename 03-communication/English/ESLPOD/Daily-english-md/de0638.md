# Fire and Firefighters

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 38: Fire and Firefighters.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 638.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can go there and downloa d a Learning Guide for this episode.  The Learning Guide contains all of  the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, culture notes, comprehension questions, and – yes there’s more – and a complete transcr ipt of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is about fire and the people who try to pu t fires out – to extinguish fires, as we’ll learn.  Those are firefighters.  Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Rebecca:  Look, there’s smoke coming from six stories up.

Hugh:  Yes, I know.  Didn’t you hear the fire alarm go  off upstairs a few minutes ago?

Rebecca:  No, but I’m really glad there’s a fire station  only a few blocks away. Hey look, there’s the fire engine.  Here come the firef ighters!

Hugh:  Yeah, let’s get back to work.  I’m sure they’ll h ave the blaze under control pretty quickly.

Rebecca:  How can you work with all of this excitement?  Ma ybe I should get the fire extinguisher from the hallway and go upstairs to h elp.

Hugh:  I think that’s a really bad idea.  You can see f or yourself that the firefighters are getting ready to fight the fire.  Th ey’re getting the ladder out and attaching the fire hose to the hydrant.  Anyway, it’s pr obably just a false alarm.

Rebecca:  If the smoke detector went off then I’m sure there’s a fire.  We’ll know if we start to see something burning near a window or ashes coming down.

Hugh:  I’ve never seen you like this before.  Why are you so  excited?

 Rebecca:  I wanted to be a firefighter when I grew up .  I’ve always had a fascination with fire.

Hugh:  Ah, that explains it.  Would it make you feel be tter if I lit up a cigarette?

Rebecca begins by saying to Hugh, “Look, there’s smoke comin g from six stories up.”  “Smoke” is the gray or black air that comes from som ething that is burning; it’s something that comes from a fire typically.  “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire” is an old expression that means if you see some eviden ce of something it’s very likely that that something actually exists.  Typically, it refers to something bad that might be happening.  Well here, the smoke is coming from the fire in a real way – literally.  The fire is in a building, and the building has six stories.  A “story” here means a floor or a level of a building.  “Story” has other meanings, of course, in English, and those can be found in this episode ’s Learning Guide.

Hugh says, “Yes, I know.  Didn’t you hear the fire alarm go off upstairs a few minutes ago?”  A “fire alarm” is a loud sound, sometime s with flashing lights, that is used to tell people – to let people know that ther e is a fire in the building and they should leave.  When I was growing up, and still I’m  sure, in schools there are “fire drills.”  These are practice exercises of what to  do, where to go if there is a fire.  And so, the school would turn on the fire a larm, and that would tell teachers and students that they needed to get up and le ave the building.  This fire alarm is in a building, and Hugh says it goes off.   He said, “Didn’t you hear the fire alarm go off?”  “To go off” is a two-word p hrasal verb, here meaning for an alarm to begin making noise.  A fire alarm is just o ne kind of alarm.  Many of us have an alarm that helps us wake up in the morning: a sound that comes from your clock or clock radio.  That’s also an alarm.  My alarm g oes off at 5:45 in the morning.  This is a fire alarm, and so the fire alarm went off.  Notice the past tense.  “To go off” can also be used with the prepositio n “on,” meaning to start yelling at or to get mad at: “I don’t want you going off on your brother.”  I don’t want you getting mad at your brother.  Or, “He went o ff on his wife for forgetting to buy his favorite food for dinner.”  He, of course, is someone who will not be sleeping in his regular bed this evening!

Rebecca says, “No (she didn’t hear the fire alarm go off) , but I’m really glad there’s a fire station only a few blocks away.”  A “fire st ation” is a large building where firefighters stay, and where there are large mac hines – large trucks really, that are called “fire engines.”  And these fire engin es go and try to put out – to extinguish, to get rid of – fires.  Rebecca says, “Hey look, there’s the fire engine.”

 As I said, it’s also called a “fire truck,” usually it’s red  in color.  She says, “Here come the firefighters!”  “Firefighters” are people who se job it is to put out fires. We used to call them simply “firemen,” but some people wanted a term that did not have the word “man” in it – we won’t talk about that issue here – so now they’re called more commonly “firefighters.”

The firefighters are coming.  Hugh says, “Yeah, let’s ge t back to work (meaning let’s return to our jobs).  I’m sure they’ll have the blaze under control pretty quickly.”  A “blaze” (blaze) is a large fire, especially a big and dangerous one. Hugh says that the firefighters will have the blaze “unde r control,” meaning they will be able to manage it, they will be able to make sure that it doesn’t get any bigger.  They’ll have it under control pretty, or very, quickly.

Rebecca says, “How can you work with all of this excitement?  Maybe I should get the fire extinguisher from the hallway and go upsta irs to help.”  A “fire extinguisher” is a metal, typically round container that you hold in your hands, and you press a button and it sprays out a chemical that he lps put out a fire – a small fire, like in your kitchen for example.  “Extinguish er” comes from the verb “to extinguish,” which means to get rid of or put out a fire.  A fire extinguisher, of course, won’t really help in this situation; you need som ething larger.

Hugh says, “I think that’s a really bad idea.  You can see for yourself that the firefighters are getting ready to fight the fire.”  W e use that verb, “to fight,” when we are talking about putting out a fire.  “They’re ge tting the ladder out and attaching the fire hose to the hydrant.”  A “ladder” (ladder) allows you to climb up high, for example to the top of a building.  A ladde r has two long pieces of metal or wood that are vertical – they go up and down, and then they are connected by smaller horizontal pieces of wood or metal, and those are the ones you use to step on to go up to a higher level.  Fire engines have ladders that can allow the firefighters to go up high to help fight the fires.

They are getting the ladder out, meaning they are get ting it ready, and attaching, or connecting, the fire hose to be hydrant.  A “hydrant ” (hydrant) is something that you will find near the road – near a street.  It  is usually painted red, sometimes orange, maybe yellow.  It is connected to the w ater pipes underneath the street, and firefighters can open the hydrant and water will come out and they use that water to put out the fire.  They use a “fire  hose,” which is a long, flexible usually plastic tube that carries the water from the hyd rant to the place of the fire.

Hugh says, “Anyway, it’s probably just a false alarm.”  A “f alse alarm” is when people think there’s a fire, but there really isn’t.  I t can also be used to talk about

 a situation where people think there’s a big problem, but there really isn’t: “I thought my friend was having a heart attack, but he wasn’ t.  It was a false alarm.”

Rebecca says, “If the smoke detector went off then I’m sure  there’s a fire.”  The “smoke detector” is a small device that you find in buildi ngs and homes that makes a very loud noise when there is smoke in the air, let ting people know that there may be a fire.  Remember, where there’s smoke, there’s fire!  Well, this smoke detector “detects,” or figures out whether there is smoke in the air, and makes a loud sound.  Rebecca says, “If the smoke detector we nt off (remember, we talked about “to go off” earlier) then I’m sure there’s a fire.  We’ll know if we start to see something burning near a window or ashes c oming down.”  “Burning” comes from the verb “to burn,” which is when something is damaged or destroyed by fire.  “Ashes” (ashes) are gray or black pieces of  powder that are left after something burns, especially wood or paper, yo u get lots of ashes.

Hugh says, “I’ve never seen you like this before.”  I guess Hugh was very excited, ‘cause his voice went up there!  “Why are you so e xcited?”  Rebecca says, “I wanted to be a firefighter when I grew up.”  Okay.  “I’ve always had a fascination with fire.”  “To have a fascination with (som ething)” means that you are very interested in something; you spend a lot of tim e thinking about something.

Hugh says, “Ah, that explains it.”  Traditionally, we t hink about boys thinking about becoming firemen when they grow up.  That’s kind  a classic, at least in the United States, dream that some young boys have, but Rebecca  said she wanted to be a firefighter when she was growing up.  Hugh says,  “Ah, that explains it (that tells me the reason why you are excited).”  Then he  tries to make a joke; he says, “Would it make you feel better if I lit up a cigare tte?”  “Lit up” comes from “to light up” (“light” is the present tense).  You can also say “lighted up,” both are correct: “lit” or “lighted.”  “To light up a cigarette ” means to burn a small fire at the end of a cigarette so that you can smoke it.  Now, the interesting thing here is that Hugh wants to go back to work even though there is a fire in the same building where he is working at, six floors up.  I guess H ugh really love his job!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
