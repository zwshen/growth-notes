><P 

>First they write some words on a few pieces of paper and put them into a bag so they cannot see the words. Next they decide whose turn is first. The first turn begins with the first player drawing and keeping a piece of paper with the word <I>A</I> from the bag and copying <I>A </I>onto a blackboard evenly spaced. </P
><P 

>Then the second player draws and keeps a piece of paper with the word <I>B</I> on it. The current player is to write <I>B</I> on the blackboard underneath <I>A </I>evenly spaced. The second player receives one candy from the first for each character that matches vertically between <I>A</I> and <I>B</I>. </P
><P 

>Now it is the first player&rsquo;s turn who similarly draws and places word <I>C</I> underneath <I>B</I> and gains a candy for each of the characters vertically matched between <I>B</I> and <I>C</I>. The game continues until there are no more words in the bag. </P

>What is the maximum number of candies that one of Alice and Bob can possibly get in a turn? </P
