This episode is called “Using Frequent Flyer Miles.”  These  are special bonuses or awards that airlines give you for flying on their ai rplanes.  It’s a dialogue between Anne and Jurgen using some vocabulary we use to ta lk about this special program.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anne:  Where were you this past weekend?  I tried callin g you on Friday to see if you wanted to go to the movies with me.

Jurgen:  I was in Chicago for a long weekend.

Anne:  Chicago?  I didn’t know you were planning a tr ip.  I thought you were pretty strapped this month.  A ticket to Chicago would set  you back at least $300.

Jurgen:  I am pretty strapped, but I wanted to go to my friend Rachel’s wedding. I was able to use my frequent flyer miles to get a ticket.   I was lucky that those weren’t blackout dates.

Anne:  Oh, that explains it.  You’ve been traveling a lot using your frequent flyer miles.  How do you rack up so many miles?  I’m enrolled i n the frequent flyer programs of three different airlines, but I never seem to have enough miles to redeem them for a ticket or even an upgrade.

Jurgen:  The trick is to get a credit card that gives you m iles.  For every dollar I charge on my credit card, I get one mile.  Since I use my credit card for a lot of business purchases, the miles add up pretty quickly.  I also use  a lot of the hotels

 and restaurants that partner with the airlines, and do ing that gives me bonus miles.

Anne: Aren’t there a lot of restrictions?  Do you ever have problems redeeming the miles?

Jurgen:  Yeah, there are some restrictions, but I work ar ound them.  There are fewer restrictions if you have elite status, but I’m a l ong way from that.

Anne:  So I need to get a credit card that gives me fre quent flyer miles.

Jurgen:  Yeah, but a word to the wise:  spend carefully.   You don’t want to rack up credit card debt for the sake of racking up frequent  flyer miles!

Anne:  Point taken.  Thanks for the tip.

Anne begins our dialogue by asking, “Where were you this past weekend?  I tried calling you on Friday to see if you wanted to go to the  movies with me.”  Jurgen explains, “I was in Chicago for a long weekend.”  A “l ong weekend” is usually a period of three days, maybe four days: Friday, Saturday, S unday, Monday or Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Americans like to have  their holidays on a Monday; that gives them a long weekend.  They get Saturd ay, Sunday, and Monday to rest from work.

So Jurgen was in Chicago, that’s why he couldn’t go with Anne to the movies last weekend.  Anne says, “Chicago?  I didn’t know you were pl anning a trip.  I thought you were pretty strapped this month.”  “To be st rapped” (strapped) means to not have any money, to have very little money, w e might also say “to be broke.”  “Strap” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Anne says, “A ticket to Chicago would set you back at least $ 300.”  “To set (someone) back” means that it cost a certain amount of mon ey, it’s the amount of money you have to pay.  It’s sort of an odd expression, for  example: “This computers set me back $1,000.”  That means the computer co st $1,000.  We usually use this expression when we are trying to indicate that it’s a lot of money: “I once bought a girlfriend a diamond necklace, it set me back $500.”  After I gave her the necklace, of course, she broke up with me and  kept the necklace; the lesson here is be careful before giving your girlfrie nd expensive jewelry!

 Anne says that a ticket to Chicago would set you back at lea st $300.  Jurgen says, “I am pretty strapped, but I wanted to go to my fri end Rachel’s wedding.  I was able to use my frequent flyer miles to get a ticket.”   “Frequent” means often; “flyer” is somebody who flies in an airplane.  In this ca se, a “frequent flyer” is someone who uses airplanes a lot – who travels a lot.  Many airline companies – many airlines have special programs were you can earn wha t they call “miles,” points for each trip that you take, and the more trips you take the more miles you get.  Eventually, if you get 20,000 or 30,000 miles you  can get a free trip.

So, Jurgen is saying that he had flown a lot before; h e had these frequent flyer miles, sort of like a coupon, that he could use to get a  ticket for free to Chicago. Jurgen says, “I was lucky that those weren’t blackout dates.”  In most airline programs they give you these miles that you can “redeem, ” or use to get a ticket, however there are certain days that they will not allow you to use your frequent flyer miles.  Usually these are around holidays when every one wants to fly, it’s very popular so you can’t use your miles on very popular da ys.  “Blackout” is when you are not allowed to do something or see somethi ng; “blackout dates” are dates that you can’t use your frequent flyer mile cou pons.  A “blackout” can also mean when there is no power, for example the elect ricity goes out in your house, and it goes out in the entire city.  That would  be called a “blackout.” “Blackout” can also mean if you’ve drunk too much and you do n’t remember what happened yesterday while you were drinking.  This doesn’t  happen to me – frequently!

Anne says, “Oh, that explains it (that explains why you wer e able to go to Chicago).”  She says, “You’ve been traveling a lot using yo ur frequent flyer miles. How do you rack up so many miles?”  “To rack up” is a two-w ord phrasal verb meaning to get a lot of something, usually by adding a  little bit at a time over a long period of time.  For example, if you have a li brary book that you don’t return on time, and you do this for several months, you borrow the book and then you don’t return it, the library charges you a “fine,” a fe e, a penalty you have to pay, you could say, “I’ve racked up $1,000 in library fines.”  An other word would be “accumulated.”

So, Anne is asking Jurgen how he racked up – how he accumu lated so many miles.  She says, “I’m enrolled in the frequent flyer pr ograms of three different airlines.”  “To be enrolled” means that you are parti cipating in something, you sign up or register for something and you are part of t hat program.  We often use this verb in talking about going to college: “I’m enrol led at the university (I am a student and I am going to classes at the university).”  Ann e says that she never seems to have enough miles to redeem them for a ticket or  even an upgrade. “To redeem” means to give something in exchange for somet hing else, usually

 points or coupons, something that is worth money that you  can give in order to get something back.  In this case, you are redeeming your frequent flyer miles to get a ticket on that airline.  An “upgrade” is an incre ase or an improvement from one thing or one level to another thing or another l evel.  With frequent flyer mile programs you can sometimes buy a ticket for a certain seat,  and then upgrade to a higher class – a better seat: a business class or a first class seat.  Airplanes have what they call “economy seats,” these are the cheap se ats, they’re also called “coach (coach) seats,” and then they have the bigge r, nicer, roomier seats that are business class and first class.  So an upgrade woul d be going from, for example, a coach class ticket to a first class ticket.

Jurgen says, “The trick (or the special way to do this) is to  get a credit card that gives you miles.  For every dollar I charge on my credit card , I get one mile. Since I use my credit card for a lot of business purchases,  the miles add up pretty quickly.”  “To add up” means to increase; it’s simil ar to “to rack up.”  “To add up” means things get bigger and bigger, usually slo wly over time.  So what Jurgen is saying here is that many airlines have agreements or partnerships with credit card companies, when you use your credit card you get  one mile, usually, for every dollar that you spend.  And since Jurgen uses hi s credit card for business expenses, he has a lot of expenses on his credit card –  a lot of charges, and he gets miles for all of those.  This is a ve ry popular program.  I do this with my credit card; I get miles for every time I buy something on my credit card.  Of course you still have to pay for it, it’s not f ree.

Jurgen says, “I also use a lot of hotels and restaurants that partner with the airlines, and doing that gives me bonus miles.”  “To par tner (as a verb) with someone” means to cooperate, to work closely with someone.  Again, there are restaurants that partner, or work with the airline comp anies, and they will give you miles for every dollar that you spend at their restaur ant.  “To get bonus miles” means to get extra, or additional, miles.  “Bonu s” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

Anne asks Jurgen, “Aren’t there a lot of restrictions?”  “Restrictions” are limitations, things that you are not allowed to do.  She says, “Do you ever have problems redeeming the miles?”  Jurgen says, “Yeah, ther e are some restrictions, but I work around them.”  “To work around (something)” means to find a way to do what you want, even though you have re strictions or limitations. It means to be successful even though there are obstacles o r things that make it difficult for you to do what you want to do.  Jurgen sa ys, “There are fewer restrictions if you have elite status.”  “Elite status” is a  very high level in a program where you get a lot of additional benefits – a lot of additional things. The frequent flyer programs have different levels of me mbership.  If you fly a lot,

 for example 100,000 miles a year, you will often be put  into a higher category in the program, and you will get more from the program .

Anne says, “So I need to get a credit card that gives me frequent flyer miles.” Jurgen says, “Yeah, but a word to the wise.”  The expressi on “a word to the wise” means that you are going to give the person some advice: “Here is some advice.” He says, “a word to the wise: spend carefully.  You don’t want to rack up credit card debt for the sake of racking up frequent flyer miles! ”  Once again, that verb “to rack up” – to accumulate, to get a lot of.  He’s sayin g you don’t want to get a lot of credit card debt, money you owe to the bank, just  so that you can get more frequent flyer miles.  “For the sake of” means “in order  to.”

Finally, Anne says, “Point taken.”  “Point taken” is an e xpression that we use to mean I understand what you are saying, I agree with wh at you are telling me. “Point taken,” she says, “Thanks for the tip.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

If we had an elite status for scriptwriters, the writer of this episode, Dr. Lucy Tse, would certainly be in that category!
