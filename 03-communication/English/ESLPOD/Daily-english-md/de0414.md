This episode is called “Common Traffic Signs.”  It’s going  to talk about the kinds of signs you see when you drive.  It will be a dialogu e between Ben and Lauren, and they’re going to be having a little problem readi ng the traffic signs.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ben:  Why are you squinting like that?

Lauren:  I left my glasses at the office.

Ben:  You mean you can’t see?!

Lauren:  I can see pretty well.  What was that yellow si gn we just passed?

Ben:  It said, “Dead End.”  Stop!  Turn around.

Lauren:  I can’t.  That sign says, “No U-turn.”

Ben:  Okay, but we can’t keep going.  Those signs say, “Do Not Enter” and “One Way.”

Lauren:  Okay, fine.  I’ll just pull off the road and you can drive.

Ben:  You can’t.  That sign says, “No Stopping.”  Hey, you  just made an illegal U- turn!

Lauren:  What else could I do?  Anyway, we’re back on tr ack now.

 Ben:  Watch out for those speed bumps!  You really are b lind without your glasses.  You’re going too fast.  According to that sign, this is a school crossing zone.  The posted speed limit is 25 miles per hour.

Lauren:  That’s only true when the lights are flashing .  Is that a “Detour” sign?

Ben:  I can’t believe it.  Will I never get home?

The dialogue begins with Ben asking Lauren, “Why are you  squinting like that?” To “squint” (squint) means to close your eyes partially so that only a small part of your eye can be seen.  Usually we do this if there is too  much light.  Or, if you can’t see very well, you close your eyes not all the way in o rder to see a little better.

Lauren says, “I left my glasses at the office.”  So, she sho uld have her glasses on while she drives, but she forgot them so she squints.  Ben  says, “You mean you can’t see?!” – do you mean that you cannot see?  Lauren  says, “I can see pretty well.  What was that yellow sign we just passed?”  The w ord “sign” is a common word to describe any piece of wood, metal, plastic, or pa per that has writing or pictures on it to give you information; all countries ha ve their own road signs.

Ben says the yellow sign said, “Dead End.”  He then says to Lauren, “Stop!  Turn around.”  To “turn around” means to take the car in the opposite direction, to go back from where you came.  A “dead end” is a street that doesn’t connect to any other street.  If you go down a street that is a dead end, you can’t go any farther; you have to turn around and go back to get out.

Lauren says, “I can’t (meaning I can’t turn around).  That sign says, ‘No U-turn.’” A “U-turn” is when you are driving down a street in one  direction – it’s a “two- way” street, meaning cars go in both directions – and you want to go in the opposite direction.  So you’re traveling, for example,  west on a street and now you want to go east on the street.  You can, in many pla ces, make a “U-turn,” where the car is traveling in the shape of a “U.”  You turn the car around so it goes in the other direction.  There are some places whe re a U-turn would be too dangerous, so you may see a “No U-turn” sign.

Ben says, “Okay, but we can’t keep going (meaning okay, you can’t take a U- turn, but we can’t keep going in the same direction).  Those signs say, ‘Do Not Enter’ and ‘One Way.’”  These are two other popular si gns you will see on

 American streets.  “Do not enter” means that you should n ot go down that street. Usually this is because there are cars coming from the other  direction and it would be dangerous.  A “one-way” street is a street tha t drivers can only move in one direction; they can only go north or they can only g o south.  A “two-way” street is a street where drivers go in both directions.  And of course, here in the United States, people drive on the right side of the st reet – the right side of the “road,” which is just another name for a street or a hi ghway.

Lauren says, “Okay, fine.  I’ll just pull off the road and you can drive.”  To “pull off” the road or the street means to slow your car down  and eventually to stop driving.  You put your car on one side of the road or st reet for a short period of time.  For example, if you get a cell phone call – a mo bile phone call – you may pull off the road so you can talk to that person and no t have to worry about causing an accident.  In some states it’s illegal to talk on  your cell phone in the car, at least to have the phone up to your face, so you may pull off the road, or pull off to the side of the road.  Lauren says she’s going to pull off the road and allow Ben to drive.  That term, “pull off,” has a coup le of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

Ben says to Lauren, “You can’t,” meaning you can’t pull o ff the road here.  He points to another sign that says, “No Stopping.”  “No St opping” is a sign that tells drivers that they can’t pull off to the side of the roa d or the side of the freeway. They have to keep driving because it would not be safe t o pull off the road at that point.  Ben then says, “Hey, you just made an illegal U-t urn!” meaning she made a U-turn where it wasn’t allowed – it wasn’t permitte d.

Lauren says, “What else could I do?  Anyway, we’re back on track now.”  To be “back on track” means to be doing something correctly after  doing it incorrectly for a certain amount of time.  So you’re doing somethi ng wrong, and then you realize and you correct your mistake, and now you’re doing  it correctly – the right way – we would say you “got back on track.”

Ben says, “Watch out for those speed bumps!”  A “speed bump ” is a small section of the road that is higher than the rest of the  road; it causes the cars to slow down.  If you try to go over a speed bump at a hi gh speed you could damage your car.  Speed bumps have become very popular in  Los Angeles in the last few years.  Many of the streets where there’s a l ot of traffic also have many people who live that street, and so they complain th at the traffic is dangerous for them and the city puts in speed bumps to sl ow the traffic down.  I personally don’t really like these, but then again, I do n’t live on a busy street.

 Ben then says to Lauren, “You really are blind without your glasses.”  To be “blind” means to be unable to see – you cannot see.  If  someone says, “you’re blind without your glasses,” they mean you cannot see very w ell at all unless you have your glasses on.  I am this way; I am blind without m y glasses.  My wife says I’m blind with my glasses, too, but that’s another pro blem!

Ben says, “You’re going too fast.  According to that sign,  this is a school crossing zone.”  A “school crossing” is a part of the street where many children, next to a school, will be crossing the street.  Because it is dangero us for children to be crossing the street when there is a lot of traffic – whe n there are a lot of cars – many places put up “school crossing” signs, meaning you should  be extra careful – you should be very careful in this area because children w ill be crossing the street, going from one side of the street to the other .  A “zone” is just another word for an area.

“The posted speed limit,” Ben says, “is 25 miles per hour .”  The “speed limit” is the maximum speed that you can drive in a particular area  or on a particular street.  In most cities, the speed limit is between 25 a nd 35 miles per hour.  That would be between 40 and 55 kilometers per hour, rough ly – approximately.  The word “posted” means that something is put in a place wh ere everyone can see it. So, the “posted speed limit” is the speed limit you see on the side of the road. On American freeways and highways the speed limit varies c onsiderably.  It’s different in different places even in different parts of the country, so you need to look at the posted speed limit to make sure you aren’t d riving too fast.

Lauren says, “That’s only true when the lights are flashi ng,” meaning the posted speed limit is 25 miles an hour only when the lights on the sign are flashing.  To “flash” means to go on and off, on and off repeatedly,  and usually quickly.  Some speed limits are only used when the sign is flashing; if t he sign isn’t flashing, then you don’t have to worry about that speed limit.  The wo rd “flash” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lauren says, “Is that a ‘Detour’ sign?”  A “detour” is a n alternate route; it’s a way to go from one place to another place when the normal  route – the normal way that you would go – is not possible.  So for example, i f they are fixing the street – there is construction on the street, or there’s a special e vent and the street is blocked – the street is closed – you might have to “take a  detour,” meaning you might have to go a different way in order to get to w here you want to go.

Ben says, “I can’t believe it.  Will I never get home?”  This expression, “will I never...” plus the verb or the result, is used when you d on’t believe something will

 happen even though you want it to happen.  So you wan t to get home, but because of all the difficulties it doesn’t look like you’r e going to get home.  So you may say, “Will I never get home?”  Or if you have, say, a n eighbor whose children like to cry and scream in the street – this is just an example, I’m not talking about my neighbor and his child – you may say, “Wi ll that child never shut up?” – will that child never be quiet.  The answer, of course, is no!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Ben:  Why are you squinting like that?

Lauren:  I left my glasses at the office.

Ben:  You mean you can’t see?!
