This episode is a dialogue between Wynn and Dixie a bout getting rewarded for using a certain company. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Wynn: I’ve come up with a surefire way to bring in more business. 

Dixie: How? 

Wynn: We’ll start a customer loyalty program. All o f the big businesses have them. 

Dixie: I’m not sure how they work. 

Wynn: They’re mainly point-based systems. Our custo mers sign up and we’ll give them a membership card or keychain tag with a barco de. Each time they make a purchase, they get points. Once they’ve accumulated  enough points, they can redeem them for rewards. 

Dixie: Okay, but what’s this? 

Wynn: It’s a punch card. Each time a customer buys something over $25, they get a punch. When they’ve received 10 punches, they  get a $10 discount. 

Dixie: I understand all that, but what is this char t for? 

Wynn: It shows our new tiered system. Customers who  spend over $1,000 a year are on the blue level, those who spend more than $5 ,000 are on the red level,  

and those who spend $10,000 are on the gold level. We’ll have incentives to get people to move up the ladder. 

Dixie: So which of these customer loyalty programs are we adopting? 

Wynn: All of them. 

Dixie: Huh? How are customers supposed to keep trac k of all of these programs? 

Wynn: Good question. See this? It’s a free wallet w e’ll be giving away. Customers can keep all of their customer loyalty ca rds in it. Isn’t it nice? 

Dixie: It’s nice, but will people really use it? 

Wynn: You’ve got a point. Maybe we should come up w ith a reward program for those who do. Hey, that’s brilliant! 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Wynn saying to Dixie, “I’v e come up with a surefire way to bring in more business.” “To come up with” somet hing is to invent or imagine or create something new. Wynn has created a “surefi re way.” “Surefire” (surefire) is something that is going to be successful, someth ing that cannot fail, cannot go wrong. Another word for this would be “foolproof” ( foolproof). Something that is “surefire” or “foolproof” will be successful no mat ter what.  

Wynn has “a surefire way to bring in more business. ” “To bring in” means to get more people in this case to buy things at a store. Dixie says, “How?” Wynn says, “We’ll start a customer loyalty program.” A “custom er” is someone who buys something from a store or a company. “Loyalty” (loy alty) is the connection and the support you have for someone or to someone. If I am “loyal” to you, I will help you even if it’s difficult, or I will always suppor t you and not someone else.  

“Customer loyalty programs” are things that compani es design, companies create, to get their customers – the people who buy  things from them – to return to them, and they do this by giving the customers s omething extra. Sometimes it’s extra discounts. Some companies will give you a certain number of points that you can collect, and if you get so many points you then get a free item from that store. Coffee shops, for example, will often have l ittle cards they give you, and each time you buy a drink, they put something on yo ur card that shows you bought a drink, and after 10 drinks you get a free drink. That’s what happens at my local coffee shop here in Los Angeles.   

 Wynn, then, wants to start a customer loyalty progr am. He says, “All of the big businesses have them.” Dixie says, “I’m not sure ho w they work.” Then Wynn explains how a customer loyalty program works. He s ays, “They’re mainly,” or primarily, “point-based systems,” meaning you get a  point for every time you buy something or perhaps a point for every dollar you s pend. “Our customers,” Wynn continues, “sign up” – or register – “and we’ll giv e them a membership card or keychain tag with a barcode.”  

A “membership card” is usually a paper or plastic c ard, sort of like a credit card. A “keychain” (keychain) is something that you use t o put your keys on when you put them in your pocket or purse. A “tag” (tag) is like a little small card that goes on your keychain. These cards or tags usually have a “barcode” (barcode) on the back of them. A barcode is a series of thin and thi ck lines that can be read by a special computer.  

“Each time they make a purchase,” Wynn says, “they”  – meaning the customers – “get points. Once they’ve accumulated enough poin ts, they can redeem them for rewards.” “To accumulate” (accumulate) means to  gather or to increase the number of something by adding to it a little at a t ime. “To accumulate enough points” means to get enough points because you’ve g one to the store over and over again.  

“Once they’ve accumulated enough points,” Wynn expl ains, “they can redeem (redeem) them for rewards (rewards).” “To redeem” m eans to exchange something usually for a price or a reward. If you g o to Las Vegas or a casino where there is gambling, they usually will give you  small, round objects, called in English “chips” (chips). These “chips” are used for  gambling at, say, the poker table. When you are done at the end of the night, i f you still have any left, you take those chips in and you “cash them in,” or we m ight use the verb “redeem” them for money.  

Normally, however, the verb “redeem” is used when s omeone gives you something that you can then exchange for or give to  someone else to get money or some other prize or reward. If you buy a lottery  ticket and you win, you can redeem that little piece of paper with the correct numbers on it for a million dollars or however much you won. By the way, congra tulations if you did win. I’d be happy to help you spend that money.  

Anyway, we’re not redeeming lottery tickets here. W e’re redeeming points for rewards. A “reward” is a prize, something you get f or free because you’ve done something well or because you’ve won some competiti on. Dixie says, “Okay, but  

what’s this?” She is showing Wynn something. Wynn s ays, “It’s a punch card.” A “punch (punch) card” is a small paper card in which  there are a series of holes made every time you buy something. There’s a small device to make holes in paper called a “punch,” and when you put the piece of paper in this little device, it makes a hole in it.  

Wynn says, “Each time a customer buys something ove r $25,” meaning worth more than $25, “they get a punch. When they’ve rece ived 10 punches, they get a $10 discount” (discount). A “discount” is a reducti on in the price of something. Sometimes it’s a percentage reduction. Sometimes it ’s an actual dollar amount. Here it’s a $10 discount. Dixie says, “I understand  all that, but what is this chart for?” A “chart” (chart) is an organized way of pres enting information. Sometimes it will have a table on it. Sometimes it will have a graphs on it.  

Wynn says, “It shows our new tiered system.” This c hart he’s looking at, then, shows their “new tiered (tiered) system.” “Tiered” refers to something with many different levels or steps. Wynn explains, “Customer s who spend over $1,000 a year are on the blue level,” or we might say “blue tier,” since “tier” (tier) is just another word for “level.” “Those who spend more tha n $5,000,” Wynn says, “are on the red level, and those who spend $10,000 are o n the gold level. We’ll have incentives to get people to move up the ladder.”  

An “incentive” (incentive) is something that motiva tes you to do something. An incentive makes you want to do something. It may be  money. It may be power. It may be the possibility of going on a date with a be autiful woman. That might be an incentive for you to go to the gym and get big m uscles like me. Well, not like me. I don’t need any more beautiful women. I have m y wife.  

Anyway, Wynn is talking about “incentives to get pe ople to move up the ladder” (ladder). “To move up the ladder” here means to inc rease in value or to go up to the next level – from the blue level, to the red le vel, to the gold level. Dixie says, “So which of these customer loyalty programs are we  adopting?” “To adopt” (adopt) here means simply to decide to use or to be gin to use. Wynn answers, “All of them.”  

Dixie is confused. She says. “Huh?” That’s a way we  indicate confusion in English, “huh?” “How are customers supposed to keep  track of all of these programs?” she asks. “To keep track (track) of” som ething is a phrasal verb meaning to know the details of something as things change. Usually we use this phrase when we are talking about a complicated syst em, as this apparently is.  

Wynn says, “Good question. See this? It’s a free wa llet we’ll be giving away.” A “wallet” (wallet) is something that a man or woman uses to put his or her money and credit cards in. Wynn is showing Dixie these wa llets, or a wallet, and telling her that they’re going to be giving them away. They ’re going to be giving them to their customers for free. “Customers,” he says, “ca n keep all of their customer loyalty cards in it. Isn’t it nice?” Dixie says, “I t’s nice but will people really use it?”  

Wynn says, “You’ve got a point.” “You’ve got a poin t” means you are right about that. He says, “Maybe we should come up with a rewa rd program for those who do.” In other words, he’s going to give them the wa llet so they can keep all of these cards in – that is, the customers can keep al l of these reward cards in. After Dixie points out that maybe customers won’t u se the wallet, Wynn says they’ll create another loyalty program, another rew ard program for those who do use the wallet. He says, “Hey, that’s brilliant,” m eaning that’s very clever. That’s smart. That’s very intelligent.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
