This episode is a dialogue between Ann and Elio abo ut being influenced by people whose behavior, whose actions, are not alway s very good. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ann: I don’t like our son watching those films and reading those books. They’re corrupting his mind.

Elio: I don’t like it either, but he’s old enough to read and watch what he likes without our interference.

Ann: But they’re brainwashing him! Those books and films are full of evil, perverted ideas.

Elio: They’re certainly blasphemous and profane. I agree with you. But what can we do? Maybe his interest in them will be short-liv ed.

Ann: Even if he loses interest, we’ll have to find a way to reverse the damage that’s been done. He’ll need to be deprogramed.

Elio: Maybe their effect will be short-lived, too. Deep down he’s a good kid. We both know that.

Ann: Yes, but those ideas are dangerous. I hope he doesn’t act on them.

Elio: Don’t even think it. That would spell disaste r.

Ann: All right, I’ll only think good thoughts.

 Elio: Good.

Ann: Where are you going?

Elio: I’m hoping for the best, but just in case, it  doesn’t hurt to monitor what he’s saying on social media.

Ann begins our dialogue by saying to Elio, “I don’t  like our son watching those films and reading those books. They’re corrupting h is mind.” “To corrupt” (corrupt) can have several different meanings. Here  it refers to changing a person’s behavior – the way a person acts in a nega tive way, to influence someone so that he starts acting dishonestly, perha ps, or in a way that we don’t approve of.

Elio says, “I don’t like it either, but he’s old en ough to read and watch what he likes without our interference.” “Interference” (in terference) is used to describe a situation where someone is getting in our way or ge tting involved in our affairs, in our actions, in a way that we don’t want. The verb is “to interfere.” So, “interference” is when someone does something that either prevents someone from doing what he wants or changes what someone do es in a way that that person isn’t very happy about. Elio doesn’t think that he and Ann can interfere in their son’s reading and film-watching.

Ann says, “But they’re brainwashing him!” “To brain wash” (brainwash) means to use some method of influencing the way someone thin ks, usually in such a way that the person loses their own ability to think for himself. We usually associate “brainwashing” with some sort of political or relig ious leader who is making his followers, the people who believe in him, do things  that they would not otherwise do. It’s always used in a negative sense – that is,  we use the verb “to brainwash” when we are referring to someone who is influencing  other people to believe things they would not otherwise believe on their ow n.

Ann says, “Those books and films are full of evil, perverted ideas.” “Evil” (evil) is the opposite of good. It means very bad, and is oft en used to refer to things that are perhaps the worst cases of some sort of ethical  or moral “badness,” you might say. There is often a religious meaning to the word “evil.” “Perverted (perverted) refers to something that is unnatural, or we might say “abnormal” (abnormal). “Abnormal” is not normal, not usual. “P erverted” is often an adjective used to refer to sexual actions or sexual desires that are considered abnormal.

 Elio says that these books “are certainly blasphemo us and profane.” “I agree with you,” he says. “Blasphemous” (blasphemous) is an ad jective used to describe something someone says against God or against relig ion in a very, I guess we would say, disrespectful way – in a not nice way. “ Profane” (profane) can mean simply the opposite of “sacred” (sacred). “Sacred” refers to things related to God, and “profane” would refer to things related to huma n beings.

However, it also has another meaning which means the same as or something similar to “blasphemous,” which is not respectful of religion or religious teachings. “Blasphemous” usually refers to things said against  God as a being, whereas “profane,” when it’s used in the negative sense, is  something that is said against religion or religious teachings that, of course, are related to God in most belief systems. Elio says, “But what can we do? Maybe his interest in them will be short-lived.”

Elio isn’t sure what he and his wife can do about their son’s interest in these books. He says, “Maybe his interest in them will be  short (short) – lived (lived).” “Short-lived” means lasting or going on for a very short amount of time – temporary. Ann says, “Even if he loses interest, we ’ll have to find a way to reverse the damage that’s been done.” “To lose (los e) interest” in something is to no longer want to know more about it or no longer want to be involved with it. “To reverse” (reverse) can mean to go in the opposite d irection – to go backwards instead of forwards, for example.

“Damage” (damage) is some negative effect on a pers on or a thing. “To reverse the damage” would be to take something that has bee n hurt or harmed and make it better again or return it to its previous health y condition or state. Ann thinks their son may need to be “deprogramed.” “To deprogr am” (deprogram) means to take someone who has been brainwashed, who has been  convinced to believe things that he would not otherwise believe, and ret urn that person to his original way of thinking – to reverse the damage of brainwas hing, you could think of it as.

These terms, “brainwashing” and “deprogramming,” we re quite popular, or at least you would hear them more often, in the 1960s and ’70s when, at least in the United States, there was a lot of news stories abou t “cults” (cults). “Cults” are usually religious groups that have beliefs and prac tices that are very different than the normal accepted common religious groups. You don’t hear people talking about “deprograming” as much anymore. In an y case, Elio says, “Maybe their effect will be short-lived, too.” “Effect” he re means result or consequence.

He says, “Deep down he’s a good kid.” “Deep down” is an expression we use to refer to something that is part of someone’s nature , or something that someone has even though it doesn’t look as though they have  it. For example, we may describe someone as being “honest deep down” even t hough right now the person is lying or being dishonest. “Deep down” mig ht also be used to describe what someone really believes or truly believes even  though the person seems to be saying something different right now.

Ann says, “Those ideas are dangerous. I hope he doe sn’t act on them.” “To act (act) on” something is to take something you believ e and do something about it – to actually change your behavior based on something  you think or believe in. Elio says, “Don’t even think it. That would spell disast er.” “To spell (spell) disaster (disaster)” means to have a very bad result or to c reate a very big problem. Ann says, “All right, I’ll only think good thoughts.” E lio says, “Good.”

Then Ann says, “Where are you going?” Elio responds , “I’m hoping for the best” – meaning, in this case, I hope our son is okay – “ but just in case,” meaning if I am wrong about that, “it doesn’t hurt to monitor wh at he’s saying on social media.” “To monitor” (monitor) means to observe and  watch something, especially when you are trying to make sure that no thing bad happens to that thing or even to that person. When you are in the h ospital, the doctors and nurses will “monitor” your heartbeat, or perhaps yo ur breathing, to make sure that nothing bad is happening to you.

“Social media” refers to websites and services onli ne such as Facebook and Twitter, where people share their thoughts and phot os with other people. “Social” refers to being part of a group, and “media” refers  to ways of communicating or ways of transferring information or giving informat ion, including photographs and movies, to other people.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
