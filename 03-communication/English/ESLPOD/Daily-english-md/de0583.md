Jan begins by saying to Tim, “This is the life!”  That ex pression, “this is the life,” is used to show when you are very happy; you’re enjoying yourse lf very much, especially doing whatever it is you are doing right now.  Jan says, “Spending the day at a spa is my idea of paradise.”  A “spa” (spa) is a b usiness where people go to usually receive some sort of treatment or service tha t makes them healthier, makes them relax, makes them more beautiful.  That would be a spa.  I definitely need a spa!  Well, this spa is Jan’s idea of pa radise.  “Paradise” is a place that is very enjoyable, a very pleasant place; we m ight say “heaven.”  This place is my idea of heaven – my idea of paradise.

Tim says, “Yeah, it’s great.”  Jan says, “Aren’t you enjoyin g yourself?”  She thinks maybe Tim really doesn’t like the spa that much.  Tim says,  “The massage was okay, but why do I have to get a facial and a body wrap?  I’m a guy!”  A “massage” (massage) is when someone touches you with their  hands, usually, to try to relax your muscles, to relax your body; to relieve te nsion, we might say. Tim says, “The massage was okay,” but he wants to know why he needs to get a facial and a body wrap.  A “facial” (facial) is a special treatment for your face, you can guess, that cleans it.  It is usually something that invo lves using different creams, or things that they put on your face.  I don’t kno w; I’ve never had one!  A “body wrap” is where your whole body is covered in some sort  of liquid, cream, lotion, or something else; it’s supposed to make the skin  of your body softer. Facials and body wraps are things that traditionally a wo man would get at a spa, not a man.  I should also mention that “wrap” (wrap),  as in body wrap, has other meanings in English that can be found in the Learning  Guide.

So Tim says, “I’m a guy,” meaning I’m a man – I’m a mal e, I should not have to get these things.  Jan says, “Men need rejuvenating, too. ”  “To rejuvenate” means to make younger, to make you feel better, make you feel new.  Some people work all day, they come home, they have a glass of wine, and they feel rejuvenated; they feel like they now have more energy.  Jan says, “These are all holistic treatments and you’ll feel like a new man when you’re done.”  “Holistic” means here relating to your entire body; relating to a ll of your health, not just one

 particular part.  The word “holistic” is used in many dif ferent ways, but usually it refers to the whole – the (whole) of something, alth ough it’s spelled (holistic), no “w”.

Jan says that these holistic treatments will make Tim feel like a new man.  She says, “Just enjoy the pampering.”  “Pampering” comes from the verb “to pamper” (pamper).  “To pamper (someone)” is to do some things f or them to make them feel good, to relax them, to make them feel comfortab le.  Often these are things that we might consider luxurious, expensive, something tha t makes you feel good.

Tim says, “I feel like an idiot.  How am I supposed to r elax?”  Jan says, “Why don’t you get a body scrub or a scalp massage instead?”  A “ body scrub” (scrub) is when they put certain things on your body, perhaps som ething that is rough – something that is what we would call “abrasive.”  They rub it on your body in order to remove the dead skin cells so that your skin seems br ighter and younger.  A “scalp massage” refers to your “scalp” (scalp), w hich is the skin on top of your head, underneath your hair – if you have ha ir!  So, a scalp massage would be someone massaging the top of your head basicall y.  Jan says, “Maybe that’ll calm your nerves.”  “To calm your nerves” means to make you feel more relaxed and comfortable.  The person who comes home and has a glass of wine or a cup of tea may do so to calm their nerves, to make them less tense, make them more relaxed.  The word “calm” has a couple of dif ferent meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

Tim says, “I don’t need a body scrub or another massage.  I just want to get out of here.  When will we be done?”  When will we be f inished here?  Jan says, “After this, all we have left (meaning the only thing that remains for us to do) are manicures and pedicures.”  A “manicure” (manicure) is whe n you go somewhere and they make your fingernails look good.  They cut them; they perhaps paint them if you’re a woman, typically.  It’s supposed to mak e your fingernails look better.  A “pedicure” (pedicure) is the same thing but for your toenails, the nails on your feet.  When I’m talking about “nails,” I’m tal king about something that is at the end of each finger or toe, on the top of them , that protects the very top of the finger.  Again, manicures and pedicures are typically things that a woman would get, not a man.

Tim says, “What?!  I’m not getting a manicure or a ped icure.”  Jan says, “You did promise to go with me to the spa if I agreed to have yo ur four college friends stay in our house for two weeks, remember?”  You see, the re ason Tim is there is it’s something he is doing for his wife.  What his wife is do ing for him is allowing him

 to invite his friends from college – from his college yea rs, many years ago – to stay in their house.  Tim says, “Yes, I remember.  All ri ght, let’s get this over with.”  “Let’s get this over with” means let’s complete t his, let’s finish this as soon as possible; usually you say it about something that is pai nful or not pleasant.

Jan says, “Just be glad I didn’t sign you up for waxing!”  “Waxing” (waxing) is another beauty treatment where hair is removed from a particular part of your body by taking hot wax – “wax” is what you make a candle ou t of – you take hot wax and you put it on the skin, and then you allow it to  cool a little so that it isn’t as hot, and then you pull it off, and with it will com e your hair in that part of your body.  It can, needless to say, be somewhat painful, especi ally for a man who has a lot of hair.  So Jan is saying just be glad I didn’ t sign you up for – meaning making appointment for you – for waxing, something that  would, again, normally be done to a woman.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
