Dan:  Talk to me in three months after you’ve had a  few too many plates of rubber chicken!

Georgia begins our dialogue by saying, “Do you know  what the best part is of my new promotion?”  A “promotion” can mean a couple of  different things.  Here, it means when you get a better job at your company.  Y ou get more money,

usually, and more responsibility.  That’s a promoti on.  A “promotion” can also be something like a sale on an item in a store, but he re it means getting a better job in your company.  Going from vice-president to pres ident, that would be a promotion.

Well, Georgia got a promotion, and the best part of  it is the expense account.  An “expense” is money that you have to pay for somethi ng for your work.  An “account” is a way of keeping track of or a way of knowing how much you are spending.  Here, we put the two together, “expense account,” and we’re talking about the money that a company will give you to spe nd on things that are related to company business.  So when you travel, for examp le, well you need to eat – you need to go to a restaurant.  The company will p ay for that; it’s part of your expense account.  It’s part of the money they give you for buying things related to your job.

Georgia says, “I can’t wait to wine and dine our cl ients.”  “To wine (wine) and dine (dine)” means to go and entertain someone with  wine – alcohol – and food. “To dine” means to eat, in this case.  So, “to wine  and dine” usually means taking someone – one of your customers, one of your client s – to a nice restaurant as part of your sales approach or to thank them for bu ying things from your company.  A “client” (client) is, as I said, anothe r word for a customer.  Usually in a big company, or when you have a customer who buys  a lot of things from your company, we call those customers “clients.”

Dan says, “The purpose of the expense account is to  win over new clients.”  “To win (someone) over” or “to win over (someone)” is a  two-word – say it with me – phrasal verb meaning to persuade or convince someon e; to get someone, in this case, to agree with you to buy something from your company.  Well, Dan says the purpose the company has for giving Georgia an e xpense account is to get new clients – to win over new clients and to keep t he current clients happy.  The “current clients” are the clients you already have,  your customers that you have right now.  Dan says the expense account is not a p ersonal slush fund.  A “slush (slush) fund” is money that you can spend for any p urpose, and often don’t have to tell anyone about it.  Slush funds can sometimes  be used for illegal purposes. A slush fund is any money the company spends that i t doesn’t keep track of. Usually that’s not allowed; you have to say where a ll of your money is going. But, a slush fund would be money that the company d oesn’t keep track of.  Dan says that an expense account is definitely not a sl ush fund.

Georgia says, “I know.  The point is to network and  to build client relationships – blah-blah-blah.”  “To network” (network) means to c reate business partnerships, to get know other people who might be clients in the future or who might help you

or your company.  It’s a verb that has become popul ar in the last 20-30 years or so, one of those words you will hear in the busines s world – to network.  Another common business expression is “to build client rela tionships.”  Well, a “relationship” is some connection you have with ano ther person.  “Client relationships” would be the communication and conne ction you have with your clients – with your customers.  But Georgia, at the  end, says, “blah-blah-blah.” What does that mean, “blah-blah-blah”?  “Blah-blah- blah” (spelled blah-blah- blah) is an informal expression we use when we don’ t want to provide all of the details, we don’t want to give a full description o f something because you understand it or it’s boring and complex and we don ’t really need to repeat it. Often it’s used sort of to dismiss or to say that t hese things aren’t very important. Your children may say, for example, to their friend s, “Oh, my parents want me to clean my room and do my homework, blah-blah-blah.”  You see, they don’t think it’s very important.  It’s also suggesting that the re are other things that you have told your children to do that they’re not saying be cause it’s sort of understood. The other person will know what they’re talking abo ut, and also know that your children don’t find those things very important.  M aybe you should talk to your children!  Well, that’s the way Georgia feels, that  yes, of course, the expense account is to help the business, but she doesn’t re ally believe that when she says, “blah-blah-blah.”

Dan says, “Schmoozing is part of our job and it’s n ot something to be taken lightly.”  “To schmooze” (schmooze) means to have i nformal conversations with people, designed to make them feel comfortable.  Th ey’re not about, often, the business itself.  When you’re talking to one of you r clients, you may be schmoozing them by talking about the weather or a b aseball game or how you both love bicycling or your last vacation to Mexico .  Whatever it is, you’re talking about informal topics, usually not even related to your business, for the purpose of becoming friendly, perhaps of making them feel w elcome or making them feel important.  Dan says, “Schmoozing is part of our jo b and it’s not something to be taken lightly.”  The expression “to take (something ) lightly” or “to be taken lightly” means to be unimportant, not to be taken seriously.   Dan says that schmoozing is something that’s serious, it’s not something to be taken lightly – to be considered not important, because it is important.

Georgia says, “Of course not.  But I’m looking forw ard to attending charity events to rub elbows with the business elite.”  A “charity ” (charity) is a group that gives money to other groups, usually to help them to help  poor people or people who need help.  They often have events; they have a par ty to help raise money – to get more money for their organization.  That would be a charity event.  “To rub elbows” is an informal expression meaning to spend time with someone or to work closely with someone, especially if that perso n is an important person.  The

“elite” (elite) are a group of people who are consi dered the best in their field or the most important people in their field.  Georgia says, “Free food, free booze, and free entertainment.”  “Booze” (booze) is anothe r word for alcohol: beer, wine, and so forth.  Georgia says, “What more could I ask  for?”  That expression means I have everything that I need; I don’t need a nything more if I have this.

Dan says, “Talk to me in three months after you’ve had a few too many plates of rubber chicken!”  The expression “a few too many” m eans too many, it’s emphasizing that you will have too many of this thi ng – a few too many.  “Plates of rubber chicken” means eating chicken – a “plate”  would just be a meal or something that’s served to you at a dinner.  Why do  we say “rubber chicken”? Well, when you go to a big party – a big event and they have a meal, chicken is a very popular dish, because most people will eat chi cken.  “Rubber chicken” means the chicken is overcooked, or it doesn’t tast e very good.  When you try to cook for, say, 500 people, it’s difficult to make e ach meal good tasting, and what you often have is food that doesn’t taste very good , and that’s why we have the expression “rubber chicken.”  When chicken is overc ooked, of course, it gets hard and a little difficult to eat.

Now let’s listen to our dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
