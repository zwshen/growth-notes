This episode is called “Feeling Lonely.”  “To be lonely” is to be sad because you are by yourself; you are alone, there is no one else with you.  Let’s get started.  > Moving to a new city can be a lonely experience.  When I first moved to Los Angeles, I didn’t know anyone and it was hard to strike up new friendships.  I’m a pretty sociable person, but it’s still hard meeting new people and even harder to make lasting friendships.  I’ve never been a lone wolf, so being in a new city out on my own was a new experience.  Sometimes I liked doing solitary things, but after awhile, I yearned to be around other people.  I would go to busy places to people-watch.  I would see families walking by, groups of friends hanging out together, and couples arm-in-arm, and wished I was walking along with them.  When you’re feeling lonely, it sometimes feels like there’s a wall between you and everyone else, a wall that’s not easy to break down.  Slowly, I started to meet people at my new job and to see them outside of work.  Having this companionship and camaraderie, especially with people I had a good rapport with, was a welcomed change.  In time, I made some good friends and I no longer dreaded the weekends.  But, I’ve never forgotten how hard it was in those first months to be a stranger in a new place!
