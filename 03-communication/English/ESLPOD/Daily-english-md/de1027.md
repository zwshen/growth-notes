In this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Orlando and Janine about making your food taste better by adding condi ments. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Orlando: Hand me that Worcestershire sauce.

Janine: Here. You’re not putting that on your burge r, are you?

Orlando: No, I’m using it for my hot dog.

Janine: Wait. You’ve put ketchup, mustard, mayonnai se, and barbecue sauce on your burger, and now you’re going to put Worcesters hire sauce on your hot dog?

Orlando: Sure, you’ve got to have Worcestershire sa uce on your hot dog.

Janine: No, I don’t. I don’t know anybody else who puts Worcestershire sauce on their hot dogs.

Orlando: You’re missing out. I just need to add a l ittle steak sauce, horseradish, tartar sauce, and a dab of chili sauce, and this ho t dog is ready to eat.

Janine: That sounds disgusting! Is there anything y ou won’t put on your food?

Orlando: On this food? Maybe maple syrup.

Janine: What?! You’re the one missing out. Hand me that syrup.

Orlando: That is truly revolting!

Janine: To each his own.

Orlando begins this dialogue by saying to Janine, “ Hand me that Worcestershire sauce.” “Worcestershire (Worcestershire) sauce (sau ce)” is a special kind of liquid made from vinegar, sugar, salt, garlic, what  are called “anchovies” – which are basically small fish – and it is used often in cooking beef. Notice that the pronunciation of this word is not like the spelling . You would think it would be pronounced something like “Worchestershire” sauce, but it isn’t. It is from the town of “Worcester” in England, and that’s how it’s  pronounced.

So, we say “Worcestershire sauce.” Personally, I do n’t really like it, but Orlando does, so Janine says to Orlando, “Here,” meaning “H ere, take it.” She’s giving him the bottle. Janine says, “You’re not putting th at on your burger, are you?” “Burger” (burger) is the same as “hamburger” – a be ef patty that is very popular in the U.S. and other countries. Orlando says, “No,  I’m using it for my hot dog.”

A “hot dog” is basically a small sausage that is us ually placed inside of a piece of bread called a “bun.” We have “hot dog buns” – brea d that is made especially for eating hot dogs – and “hamburger buns.” Janine says , “Wait, you put ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and barbecue sauce on your bur ger, and now you’re going to put Worcestershire sauce on your hot dog?”

Janine mentions several different things that Orlan do has put on his hamburger. All of these things that we’ve been talking about, including Worcestershire sauce, are called in general “condiments” (condiments). Th ese are things you put on your food to make them taste better, usually after it is cooked. Some examples of condiments are mentioned here: ketchup, mustard, ma yonnaise, and barbecue sauce.

“Ketchup” (ketchup) is a thick red sauce made from tomatoes, vinegar, salt, sugar, and a few other things, that is usually used  in the U.S. when you are eating French fries. Some people, like me, love eat ing French fries, which are deep-fried pieces of potato, with ketchup. Many peo ple, including me, also like to put ketchup on a hamburger to improve its taste.

“Mustard” (mustard) is a thick yellow or brown sauc e that is made from mustard seeds as well as vinegar, salt, and a few other thi ngs. “Mayonnaise” (mayonnaise) is a thick, white, creamy sauce made b y mixing oil and the yellow

part of an egg – what we call the “egg yolk” (yolk)  – vinegar, lemon juice, and a few other things together, and it produces somethin g wonderful called “mayonnaise.”

Finally, there is “barbecue (barbecue) sauce.” Barb ecue sauce is a thick, dark brown liquid that is usually sweet and is used to c ook certain kinds of meat on what we call a “barbecue,” which is basically an op en flame with a “grill” over it – a series of metal bars that you put the food on. Yo u can put barbecue sauce on chicken, on pork ribs – the piece of meat that come s from a pig. Lots of different things can be used with barbecue sauce. It’s very p opular in the U.S. for grilling food outside, especially.

Orlando says, “Sure, you’ve got to have Worcestersh ire sauce on your hot dog.” Now, I personally never eat this kind of sauce, I t hink I mentioned, but Orlando wants it on his hot dog. Janine disagrees with Orla ndo. She says, “No, I don’t,” meaning “I don’t have to have that sauce on my hot dog.” She continues, “I don’t know anybody else who puts Worcestershire sauce on their hot dogs.”

Orlando says, “You’re missing out.” “To miss (miss)  out” is to not to experience something – not to have an opportunity to do someth ing or see something that is good or pleasurable. “I missed out on the baseball game last night.” I didn’t have an opportunity to see it. “To miss out” is to lose an opportunity to see or participate in something good. Orlando is telling J anine that she is missing out on the great taste of putting this sauce on hot dogs.

He continues, “I just need to add a little steak sa uce, horseradish, tartar sauce, and a dab of chili sauce, and this hot dog is ready  to eat.” Orlando gives us another list of condiments that are common with som e Americans. The first one is “steak sauce.” “Steak sauce” is a dark brown sau ce – made from tomatoes, vinegar, I think raisins, and a few other things – that is sometimes used on steak.

Now, many people think that steak sauce ruins the t aste of steak. Other people think that it helps the taste of steak, especially if the steak is somewhat overcooked, I think. I don’t personally use steak s auce on my steak, but if you go to some restaurants in the U.S., they will give you  steak sauce with your steak if you want it.

“Horseradish” (horseradish) is a thick, somewhat sp icy, white-colored sauce – or, it’s not exactly white, but it’s close to white. It ’s made from vinegar and the part of a plant called “horseradish.” There’s a horseradish  plant, which I believe is a kind of cabbage. Horseradish sauce is very popular on ho t dogs in the U.S. Again, I don’t like it very much, so I don’t put anything on  my hot dogs like horseradish.

 “Tartar (tartar) sauce” is a thick, creamy, white s auce that is often used with fried seafood – things like fried fish. It’s made from ma yonnaise, lemon juice, I believe there’s some pickles in there, as well as other ing redients. Tartar sauce is very common when eating fried fish.

“Chili sauce” is the last thing that Orlando mentio ns. “Chili (chili) sauce” is a hot sauce usually made from spicy peppers as well as vi negar, salt, and a few other things. It’s usually red. If you like your food spi cy, and I don’t, then you could put a dab of chili sauce on it. “A dab” (dab) of someth ing is a little bit. It’s a small amount of something.

Janine, however, says to Orlando, “That sounds disg usting.” When we say something is “disgusting” (disgusting), we mean it is very unappealing. It’s something that would make you sick. It’s something that we might also describe as being “gross” (gross). It’s a very negative way to describe food, in particular. Janine says, “Is there anything you won’t put on yo ur food?”

Orlando says, “On this food?” He says, “Maybe maple  syrup.” “Maple” (maple) is a kind of tree which is very popular in Canada. In fact, one of the symbols of Canada, our neighbor to the north, is a maple leaf from the maple tree. From a maple tree, you get something called “maple syrup” (syrup), which is a thick, sweet, brown liquid that is made from maple trees –  technically from what is called the “sap” (sap) of a maple tree, which is the liquid inside of a tree.

Maple syrup is often used on breakfast dishes such as pancakes, French toast, and other kinds of breakfast foods. It’s very sweet . Orlando says he wouldn’t put maple syrup on his hot dog or hamburger. Janine is surprised by this. She says, “What? You’re the one missing out,” meaning now you  are the one who is missing a good opportunity to taste something good.  She says, “Hand me that syrup.”

So Janine, after complaining about all the things that Orlando is putting on his food, is now going to put maple syrup on her hambur ger or hot dog. Now that really is very unusual, and Orlando describes how the average American would probably react to that combination of beef and mapl e syrup by saying, “That is truly revolting.” “Revolting” (revolting) means the  same as here as “disgusting” – something that is very gross, especially, again, re ferring to food.

Janine then ends with a common expression: “To each  his own.” “To each his own” means everybody likes something different. Eac h person has his or her

own tastes and what you may like, I may hate. This is true with my wife and me. If she likes something, I usually hate it when it c omes to food.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Orlando: Hand me that Worcestershire sauce.

Janine: Here. You’re not putting that on your burge r, are you?

Orlando: No, I’m using it for my hot dog.

Janine: Wait. You’ve put ketchup, mustard, mayonnai se, and barbecue sauce on your burger, and now you’re going to put Worcesters hire sauce on your hot dog?
