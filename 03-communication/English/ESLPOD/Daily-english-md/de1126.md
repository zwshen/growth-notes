# Using a Pawnshop

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,126 – Using a Pawnshop.  

This is English as a Second Language podcast episod e 1,126. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. (I don’t know. N ot enough coffee this morning. Sorry.)  

Visit our website at ESLPod.com. You can become a m ember of ESL Podcast when you do that. This episode is a dialogue about using a pawnshop – a store where you can bring your old items and get money fo r them. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Jamaica: I need to raise some cash right away. I’m thinking of hocking a few things. You’ve used the pawnshop down the street be fore, right? 

Nolan: Yeah, a few years ago when I lost my job. I needed a short-term loan to tide me over until I could find a new one.  

Jamaica: Is the place legit?  

Nolan: It seemed to be. I have no complaints. 

Jamaica: That’s good. How would I go about pawning something?  

Nolan: It’s pretty simple. You bring the pawnbroker  something that’s worth money to use as collateral and then you get a loan for a fraction of its value. Then, you have 90 days to repay the loan, plus interest and f ees.  

Jamaica: How do I redeem my item? 

Nolan: You just show them your pawn ticket. 

Jamaica: That sounds pretty simple. What if I can’t  repay the money by the deadline? 

Nolan: Then you forfeit your item. The pawnshop tri es to sell it to recoup the money they lent you. 

Jamaica: Okay, I’m going to do it. I’m going to paw n my collection. 

Nolan: Your collection of what? 

Jamaica: Action figures. I have the entire collecti on of ESL Podcast action figures. There’s Jeff, Lucy, Warren, Jessica, Adria no, Pao, LeeAnn, Alison . . . 

Nolan: I said something worth money, remember?

Jamaica says to Nolan, “I need to raise some cash r ight away.” “To raise (raise) cash,” or “to raise money,” means to get money for some specific purpose. Certain organizations, for example, try to raise mo ney to support the goals and activities of the organization. If a person, an ind ividual, says that she wants to raise cash or needs “to raise some cash right away, ” as Jamaica says, usually she means that she needs money for some specific re ason.  

Jamaica says, “I’m thinking of hocking a few things .” The verb “to hock” (hock) means to leave something usually at a place called a “pawn (pawn) shop” in exchange for money. Basically what you are doing is  giving the pawnshop, say, a ring or a computer or something valuable in exchang e for money that the pawnshop gives to you. Now, usually a pawnshop will  keep what you give them for a certain number of days or weeks, and if you d on’t come back and buy it back – give them money to get your item back – well , the pawnshop will then sell it to someone else.  

Pawnshops are popular still in the United States in  some neighborhoods, especially poorer neighborhoods where people often need to get money and so they try to sell – or we would even use the verb “p awn” – their items. The verb “to pawn” means the same is the verb “to hock.” Jamaica  says, “You’ve used the pawnshop down the street before, right?” Nolan says , “Yeah, a few years ago when I lost my job.” People don’t usually use a paw nshop unless they really need money badly. They don’t want to get rid of their va luable things, but they don’t have a choice sometimes.  

Nolan says, “I needed a short-term loan to tide me over until I could find a new one” – that is, a new job. Many people use pawnshop s basically as a way of getting a loan for something they need money for ri ght now. Then they try to get money together to buy whatever it is that they gave  to the pawnshop back. Nolan says he needed a “short-term loan,” meaning money t hat you give someone for  

only a short period of time. It might be a month. I t might be two months. It might be a year. 

“To tide someone over” means to help someone throug h a difficult situation. If someone says, “I need $100 to tide me over until to morrow,” the person is telling you that he needs $100 in order to pay his bills an d expenses until tomorrow. If you’re lucky, you’ll get your money back tomorrow.  

Nolan says he needed a short-term loan to tide him over until he could find a new job. Jamaica says, “Is the place legit?” The word “ legit” (legit) is short for an informal way of saying “legitimate” (legitimate).”L egitimate” means real, something that is not fake, something that is what it says it is.  

Nolan says, “It seemed to be. I have no complaints. ” A “complaint” (complaint) is a statement that you are dissatisfied, disappointed , or unhappy with something. If someone says, “I have no complaints,” the person me ans that he was happy (with, in this case, the pawnshop). Jamaica says, “ That’s good. How would I go about pawning something?” “To go about” means to do . “How would I pawn something?” is what Jamaica is asking here.  

Nolan says, “It’s pretty simple,” meaning it’s very  simple. “You bring the pawnbroker something that’s worth money to use as c ollateral, and then you get a loan for a fraction of its value.” A “pawnbroker”  (pawnbroker) is a person who owns a pawnshop. Nolan says, “You give the pawnbrok er something that’s worth money” – something that has value, maybe an old rin g or a phone or a computer. That thing, that item, is used as collateral. “Coll ateral” (collateral) is something that you give someone in order to get a loan. It’s something that we would say “secures” the loan.  

For example, if you want to buy a car, and you want  to get a loan for the car, a bank may ask you for collateral. They may ask you, in other words, for something that’s worth money, so in case you don’t pay the lo an back, they can get their money back. Now, the car itself may serve as collat eral. For example, when you buy a house, when you get a loan to buy the house, the house itself is your collateral. If you don’t pay the loan back, the ban k will take your house. So, collateral is something worth something that allows  you to get a loan.  

In a pawnshop, whatever you bring to the pawnbroker  is your collateral, and the pawnbroker will then give you money as a loan. But the pawnbroker won’t give you 100 percent of what the item is worth. The pawn broker will only give you “a fraction of its value.” A “fraction” (fraction) is a term from mathematics that refers to a part of something, a portion of something. One -half, one-third, one-  

hundredth – those are all “fractions,” percentages of the whole amount. “Value” (value) is what something is worth, how much money it is worth.  

Nolan says, “Then, you have 90 days to repay the lo an, plus interest and fees.” “To repay (repay) a loan” means to give the person who gave you the loan the money back. You’re giving him the money that he gav e you. Now, when you go to a pawnbroker, you have to give the money that th e pawn broker gave you plus “interest,” which is basically the price of the loa n. It may be 1 percent, it maybe 10 percent.  

Jamaica says, “How do I redeem my item?” “To redeem ” (redeem) in this case means to get something back that you originally own ed. At a pawnshop, it means to get back what you gave the pawnbroker in order t o get the loan. Nolan says, “You just show them your pawn ticket.” When you giv e something to a pawnbroker, the pawnbroker will give you a little p iece of paper called a “ticket” that usually has a number on it, and you bring that  back and the pawnbroker can find your item in order to give it back to you – af ter, of course, you’ve paid the pawnbroker the money that he lent you.  

Jamaica says, “That sounds pretty simple. What if I  can’t repay the money by the deadline?” That is, what if 90 days goes by and you  don’t have money to get your item back? Nolan says, “Then you forfeit your item. ” “To forfeit” (forfeit) means to lose something, especially as a punishment for fail ing to do something. In this case, it means you no longer own the item that you gave to the pawnbroker. You can no longer get it back, at least not by just pay ing the loan amount.  

Nolan says, “The pawnshop tries to sell it to recou p the money they lent you.” So, if you give the pawnshop your wedding ring in order  to get a short-term loan, and you are not able to pay the loan back, the pawnshop  will sell your wedding ring to someone else. Maybe your wife will buy it. Who know s?  

Nolan says the pawnshop sells things “to recoup” th eir money. “To recoup” (recoup) means to recover something, to get somethi ng back that was lost. In this case, the pawnshop needs to get back the money  that they lent you that you did not pay them back. Jamaica says, “Okay, I’m goi ng to do it. I’m going to pawn my collection.” A “collection” is a set of objects that are related to each other. Some people like to collect coins. Some people like  to collect dolls. Some people like to collect old magazines.  

What does Jamaica collect? Action figures. “Action figures” are little toys that are in the shape of a person or some character. Often, in movies for children, the movie studio – the company that makes the movie – w ill sell little toys, little action  

figures, and you can move the little arms and the l ittle legs, and of course your children are going to want to buy them because they  saw the movie.  

Jamaica collects action figures of ESL Podcast char acters. She says, “There’s Jeff, Lucy, Warren, Jessica, Adriano, Pao, LeeAnn, Alison . . .” In other words, Jamaica has, apparently, action figures of those of  us who work on ESL Podcast. I didn’t even know these existed, but I guess they do, because it’s in the dialogue. Jamaica wants to sell these things – or p awn these things, rather – to the pawnshop.  

But Nolan interrupts her and says, “I said somethin g worth money, remember?” Nolan is I think making a joke here. He’s saying th at action figures from ESL Podcast would not be worth any money, and the pawnb roker wouldn’t give you any money if you tried to hock or pawn them at his pawnshop. Well, I think they’d be worth a lot of money. Don’t you?  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a na tive rate of speech.
