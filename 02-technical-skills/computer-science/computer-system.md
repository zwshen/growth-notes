## Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3/E (CS:APP3e)

http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/

CMU 兩位教授 Randal E. Bryant 和 David R. O’Hallaron 巧妙地把程式設計及效能最佳化、數位電路基礎、指令集架構、組合語言、儲存裝置、連結器與載入器、行程、虛擬記憶體等等自各不同的學科的核心知識點攪和在一起，並以程式開發者的視角呈現，所以這本書的書名叫 “A Programmer’s Perspective”。

### Introduction to Computer Systems (ICS)

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/

The ICS course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.

## Core systems

**Topics covered**:
`procedural programming`
`manual memory management`
`boolean algebra`
`gate logic`
`memory`
`computer architecture`
`assembly`
`machine language`
`virtual machines`
`high-level languages`
`compilers`
`operating systems`
`network protocols`
`and more`
