[start of dialogue] 

Wanda: Oh hi, I wasn’t expecting you today. 

Enrique: We’ve been cleaning out our garage, and yo ur sister said I should come by with a few things for your baby. 

Wanda: That’s really sweet of you guys, but I’m not  due for another six months. 

Enrique: But you’ll need these things to get the ba by’s room ready, right? 

Wanda: Well, we don’t actually have a baby room set  up yet.  

Enrique: There’s no time like the present. Here’s a  crib and the mattress. It just needs to be assembled. Oh, here are some bumper pad s that go with it. 

Wanda: Great. 

Enrique: Here’s a changing table.  

Wanda: Wow, that’s really big.  

Enrique: Here are two car seats, one for infants an d one for toddlers, and here’s a booster seat. 

Wanda: That’s a lot of stuff. Are you sure you want  to part with all this?  

 Enrique: Positive. Here’s a basic baby monitor and a video monitor so you can keep tabs on the little one. 

Wanda: Whoa, what’s in all these bags? 

Enrique: They’re baby and kids clothes. You’ll need  more than you think. 

Wanda: That’s really generous of both of you, but a re you sure you want to give it all to me? 

Enrique: Of course, you’re family and this will hel p you save a lot of money. 

Wanda: And it’ll free up garage space for your new workshop? 

Enrique: Well, why not kill two birds with one ston e?

Wanda begins our dialogue by saying to Enrique, “Oh  hi, I wasn’t expecting you today” – I didn’t think you were coming today. Enri que says, “We’ve been cleaning out our garage, and your sister said I sho uld come by with a few things for your baby.” “To clean out” means to clean compl etely or thoroughly. A “garage” is a place where you normally store your c ar, although many people use it to store other things, and that’s the case with Enrique and his wife. They have cleaned out their garage and are bringing some thin gs for Wanda.  

Wanda says, “That’s really sweet of you guys.” The word “sweet” here means nice or kind. “But,” Wanda continues, “I’m not due for another six months.” When we talk about when a mother is “due” (due), we mean  when she expects to give birth to the baby. Enrique says, “But you’ll need t hese things to get the baby’s room ready, right?” Enrique is saying well, yes it’ s six months, but you still need to get the room where the baby will be staying prep ared and ready. 

Wanda says, “Well, we don’t actually have a baby ro om set up yet.” “To set up” means to prepare, usually involving perhaps moving furniture around, in this case, or perhaps putting a place for the baby to sl eep. That would be “setting up” a baby room. Enrique says, “There’s no time like th e present.” This is an old expression – a cliché, really. “No time like the pr esent” (present). It means that you should take advantage of an opportunity to do s omething immediately, right away, without waiting.  

Enrique says, “Here’s a crib and the mattress.” A “ crib” (crib) is a special place where babies sleep. It’s a bed that has high sides to it, almost like walls, that prevent the baby from falling out. A “mattress” (ma ttress) is a soft, comfortable surface that you sleep on. Enrique says to Wanda, “ Here’s a crib and the mattress,” meaning the mattress that goes with the crib or inside of the crib.  

He says, “It just needs to be assembled.” “To assem ble” (assemble) means to put something together, especially when there are a  lot of small parts. Many people buy furniture at a store such as IKEA, and w hen they bring it home, they have to assemble the furniture. This of course is s ometimes almost impossible, in the same way that assembling children’s toys is som etimes impossible. But we hope it won’t be impossible for Wanda to assemble t his crib. 

Enrique continues, “Oh, here are some bumper pads t hat go with it.” “Bumper (bumper) pads (pads)” are cushions – soft material – that are placed against the walls of the cribs so that the baby doesn’t hit his  or her head against the side of the crib. It’s sort of like a mattress, but it’s ve rtical so the baby doesn’t hit his or her head against the side of the crib and hurt him or herself.  

Wanda says, “Great.” She means, “That’s wonderful. I’m very happy.” Enrique then says, “Here’s a changing table.” A “changing t able” would be a special table that you use, on which you put the baby when you ar e changing the baby’s clothes – in particular changing the baby’s diapers , which is the part of the clothes the baby wears around its middle, because o f course babies don’t get up and use the bathroom the way the rest of us do. I w ish they did.  

Wanda says, “Wow, that’s really big.” She’s referri ng to the changing table. Enrique, however, just continues on giving her thin gs. He says, “Here are two car seats, one for infants and one for toddlers, and he re’s a booster seat.” A “car seat” is a general term used to describe a special chair that you use in a car, into which you put a baby or young child.  

In the United States – in most states, perhaps in a ll states – you must put a baby or a small child in a car seat. You can’t just hold  the baby in your arms, for example. That’s against the law. The idea is, of co urse, to protect the baby or the small child should there be an accident. There are two kinds of car seats mentioned here. One is for “infants” (infants) and one is for “toddlers” (toddlers). An “infant” is a small baby, a very young baby. A “ toddler” is a young child, usually one who has already learned how to walk. Th ose are the most dangerous kind.  

So, there are car seats for infants. There are bigg er car seats for toddlers. Enrique also gives Wanda a “booster (booster) seat. ” A booster seat is a special seat – or small chair, I guess you could think of i t as – that is used to keep a child, an older child, safe in a car by lifting his  or her body high enough so that the seat belt crosses the body at the appropriate h eight. A “seat belt” is a special piece of material, a strap, that you put over your body to prevent your body from being thrown out of the car in case of an accident.   

So, for older children who are too old for a car se at, there are booster seats that the older children can have underneath them. Wanda says, “That’s a lot of stuff” – that’s a lot of things. “Are you sure you want to  part with all of this?” “To part with” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to get rid of something, to give something away, especially something that migh t have some sort of emotional or sentimental value, something that you like a lot.  

Wanda asks Enrique if he’s sure that he wants to pa rt with all of these things. Some parents, for example, like to keep all of the things that they used for their baby for many years. My mother never did that. Ther e was always another baby that needed to use it. Although, I was the youngest , so I guess she got rid of it after me. Enrique says, “Positive,” meaning yes, he ’s absolutely sure he wants to part with this stuff.  

He continues, “Here’s a basic baby monitor and a vi deo monitor so you can keep tabs on the little one.” A “baby monitor” is a smal l electronic device, one part of which is in the room where the baby is sleeping and  the other is usually in the parents’ bedroom. You can hear the baby, so if the baby makes noise or wakes up, you can hear it on the baby monitor. It’s like a little radio between one room of the house and another room of the house, or that  connects the two rooms together.  

A “video monitor” would be the same sort of thing e xcept it’s actually a video camera, and you can look and see your baby from ano ther room. You use these “to keep tabs on” your baby. “To keep tabs (tabs) o n” someone is to monitor someone or, we might say, to keep track of someone – to get information on someone so you know how he or she is doing. Wanda s ays, “Whoa, what’s in all these bags?” Enrique says, “They’re baby and kids c lothes.” You’ll need more than you think.  

Wanda says, “That’s really generous of both of you,  but are you sure you want to give it all to me?” Enrique says, “Of course, you’r e family,” meaning you’re part of our family (I’m guessing that Enrique is married to  Wanda’s sister here). He says, “This will help you save a lot of money.” But Wanda  sees that there’s another  

reason that Enrique is giving her all of these thin gs, and she tells us at the end of the dialogue. She says, “And it will free up garage  space for your new workshop?”  

“To free up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to make something available, especially space or time. You can talk about “freei ng up your schedule,” meaning canceling some of your appointments or arranging th ings so that you have time to do something special. A “workshop” (workshop) is  a room or an area in a room where you build or fix things. Some people have a “ wood workshop” in their garage where they cut wood and do things with wood.  I don’t have any of these sorts of things in my house.  

Enrique says, “Well, why not kill two birds with on e stone?” Enrique is saying yes, I am also trying to make room for my workshop, and that’s why I’m giving you all of this stuff. He uses an old expression, “to kill two birds with one stone.” This means to solve two problems at once, with one actio n. If you can imagine a stone, a small rock, being thrown up into the air a nd killing not just one bird but two birds, then you get the idea that you can use o ne action in order to accomplish two different things or to achieve two d ifferent purposes.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
