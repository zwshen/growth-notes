This episode is called “Improving Your Looks.”  It’ s going to talk about “physical features,” things that may make you look more hands ome or more beautiful. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Leo:  Where have you been?

Mai:  I’ve been meeting with an agent.  You know I’ ve wanted to pursue a career in acting for a long time, but today I actually met  with a real agent.  She thinks I have potential.

Leo:  Is she going to sign you?

Mai:  She might.  She suggested a few improvements that are going to make me more salable as an actress.

Leo:  What did she suggest?

Mai:  Well, she thought I should get some hair exte nsions to make my hair look longer and fuller.

Leo:  There’s nothing wrong with your hair.

Mai:  Well, she thought it could use some sprucing up.  She also recommended getting my teeth capped.  At the very least, she sa id I should have teeth whitening done.

Leo:  Your teeth look nice and natural.  There’s no thing wrong with them.

 Mai:  She also suggested getting a spray tan, so I’ d look healthier.

Leo:  You already look healthy.  Is she crazy?

Mai:  No, I think she’s giving me good constructive  criticism.  I want to make myself as salable as possible.

Leo:  It sounds like she wants to stamp out all of your individuality and turn you into a clone of every other actress out there.

Mai:  I was thinking of taking her advice.  I want to be salable.

Leo:  You’re a person, not a piece of meat.  Salabl e, schmalable!  Don’t you even think about it!

[end of dialogue]

Leo begins our dialogue by saying to Mai, “Where ha ve you been?”  Mai says, “I’ve been meeting with an agent.”  An “agent,” in this case, is a person who represents actors, musicians, writers, or other art ists to try to find work for them. Most actors here in Los Angeles – in Hollywood – ha ve an agent, someone who tries to find jobs for them – and not jobs working as a waiter or waitress!  “Agent” has some other meanings in English as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  She says, “You k now I’ve wanted to pursue a career in acting for a long time,” she wants to bec ome an actor, Mai does, “but today I actually met with a real agent.  She thinks  I have potential.”  “Potential” means the possibility of being able to do something ; you’re not doing it right now but you have the ability to do it, perhaps, in the future.

Leo says, “Is she going to sign you?”  “To sign you ” is to create a “contract,” a legal agreement to work for this particular person.   We normally talk about athletes – professional athletes, singers, artists,  they sign with a certain company, or in the case of athletes a certain team,  and therefore have to work for them.  That’s what Mai is referring to – or rat her Leo, he’s asking the question I guess.

Mai says, “She might,” she might sign me, it’s not clear, we’re not sure.  She says her agent “suggested a few improvements that a re going to make me more salable as an actress.”  “Salable” (salable) comes from the word “sale,” which is related to the verb “to sell.”  “Salable” is the ab ility to be sold easily.  In the case of a person, it would be the ability to get a job o r to get work because of your

qualities or characteristics.  Mai says that her ag ent wants to make her more salable as an actress.  Notice that she uses both t he word “actor” and “actress.” Traditionally, a woman was called an “actress,” a m an was called an “actor,” but more recently the word “actor” has been used to des cribe both a man and a woman, but women can still call themselves “actress es.”  The word “actors” could refer to a man or to a woman.

Mai says that her agent has suggested that she get some hair extensions to make her hair look longer and fuller.  “Hair extens ions” are basically artificial hair, not your own hair, that you attach or put on your h air to make your hair look longer.  It’s something that has become popular for  women to do, although I’m thing of getting some hair extensions myself.  Firs t I have to get some hair, then I’ll get the hair extensions!  The hair extensions will make Mai’s look longer and fuller.  “Fuller hair” would be hair with more volu me, hair that has a lot of shape. It doesn’t just hang down from your head; it seems to move around more, perhaps.  That’s fuller hair.

Leo says, “There’s nothing wrong with your hair,” m eaning your hair is just fine the way it is right now.  Mai says, “Well, (her age nt) thought it could use some sprucing up.”  “To spruce (spruce) up (something)” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to make something look a little nicer, to i mprove the way it looks. Normally we use this to talk about, for example, yo ur house.  We clean it up; we make it look nicer.  Here, it’s being used to talk about Mai’s hair.  So, Mai says that the agent also recommended getting her teeth c apped.  “To cap (cap) your teeth” means to go to the dentist and allow the den tist put little pieces over each of your teeth, basically covering your teeth with s omething that looks like teeth but is whiter and has a better appearance.  Mai say s, “At the very least, she said I should have teeth whitening done.”  “At the very least” means the minimum that she should do would be to get some teeth whitening.   “To whiten your teeth” means to make them whiter.  “Teeth whitening” is wh en you put something on your teeth to make them whiter, especially if your teeth perhaps are yellow or gray it makes your teeth look a little better.

Leo says, “Your teeth look nice and natural.  There ’s nothing wrong with them.” Mai says the agent also suggested getting a spray t an, so she’d look healthier.  A “spray tan” is where you go to a place and they bas ically paint your body; they spray this chemical to make your skin look darker.  So you don’t have to go out into the sun and sit in the sun; you can just have someone spray paint on you – a kind of chemical, it’s not paint.  It makes you loo k as though you had gone sun tanning.  This has become very popular here in Los Angeles with celebrities – with actors and actresses.  I do not have a spray t an, so I guess I’m not a celebrity!

 The agent thought it – the spray tan – would make M ai look healthier.  Leo says, “You already look healthy.  Is she (this agent) cra zy?”  Mai says, “No, I think she’s giving me good constructive criticism.”  “Cri ticism” is when you tell someone what they are doing wrong.  “Constructive c riticism” is telling someone what they are doing wrong, but you are telling them  so that they can improve it, to make it better.  You’re telling them yes, you’re  doing that wrong, but if you do this you can do it better or you can improve the wa y you are doing it.  So if someone says, “You’re ugly,” well, that’s criticism .  But if they say, “You’re ugly, but if you had more hair on your head, then you wou ld be less ugly.”  That’s what people tell me all the time!

So, Mai is getting what she thinks is constructive criticism from her agent.  She says, “I want to make myself as salable as possible .”  Leo says, “It sounds like (this agent) wants to stamp out all of your individ uality and turn you into a clone of every other actress out there.”  Leo says, “It s ounds like (meaning it appears to me or it seems to me) that (your agent) wants to st amp out all of your individuality.”  “To stamp out” is a two-word phras al verb meaning to end or eliminate something, to get rid of something.  What  the agent wants to get rid of – to eliminate – is Mai’s individuality.  “Individual ity” means the things that make you special, unlike anyone else, the things that ma ke you unique.  Instead, this agent wants to turn Mai into – to change her into –  a clone of every other actress out there.  A “clone” (clone) in this case means an  exact copy of another person. You will look just like the other person, dress lik e them, talk like them, and so forth.  The agent wants Mai to look like all of the  other beautiful Hollywood actresses; she will be a clone of all the other act resses out there.  “Out there” just means working right now; in existence.

Mai says, “I was thinking of taking her advice.  I want to be salable.”  Leo says, “You’re a person, not a piece of meat.”  He means t hat she’s not an object; she isn’t selling herself.  She shouldn’t be trying to just sell herself; she should realize that she’s a unique individual, a human being.  Leo  says, “Salable, schmalable! Don’t you even think about it!”  The word “schmalab le” isn’t a real word.  What Leo is doing is using the sound “schm” (schm), whic h is very common in Yiddish words, and attaching it to English to create a word  to be funny, to make a word sound like as if it were Yiddish.  Yiddish, as you may know, is a language that is spoken; it is a form of German, but was popular and  still is in some areas among those who are of the Jewish religion.  At least tha t’s its association.  The word “Yiddish” actually means Jewish.  Several early Ame rican comedians in the 20 th century were associated with Yiddish culture, the Y iddish language and used it. One of those was a man by the name of Leo Rosten, w ho wrote a couple of very

funny books that I remember reading when I was in h igh school.  The Joy of Yiddish  I think one of them was called.

Anyway, our Leo is using a little Yiddish joke here .  He’s saying, “Salable, schmalable.”  What it means is that you are saying that’s not important or that’s not something we should worry about.  For example y ou could say, “I have to read a bunch of books,” and your friend says, “Ah, books, schmooks!  Stop it, we need to go have fun.”  The “schmooks” means that the books aren’t important. It’s one of those strange changes that native speak ers will sometimes make to their own language to make it funny.  I think most languages have similar strategies in making funny expressions, and this is  just another one of those.

Anyway, Leo says, “Don’t even think about it.”  Tha t expression is used to warn someone that this is a very bad idea.  Leo thinks it’s a bad idea for Mai to try to change her physical appearance just so she can be m ore salable – kind of like that old Billy Joel song, [Jeff sings] “Don’t go ch anging to try and please me.” Remember that one?  No?  Okay.

Well, now we’ll listen to the dialogue, this time a t a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Leo:  Where have you been?

Mai:  I’ve been meeting with an agent.  You know I’ ve wanted to pursue a career in acting for a long time, but today I actually met  with a real agent.  She thinks I have potential.

Leo:  Is she going to sign you?

Mai:  She might.  She suggested a few improvements that are going to make me more salable as an actress.

This episode is called “Finding Other Singles,” peo ple who do not have a romantic partner.  Let’s get started. > I was tired of being single.  All of my friends had  paired up and I was left hanging. Like everybody else these days, I tried using the I nternet to find other singles, but I never had any luck.  Cruising for my ideal woman among a bunch of lonely hearts is like looking for a needle in a haystack.  I needed another strategy.

> They were definitely glad to see me.  I even receiv ed a couple of invitations to dinner that day.  But to be honest, that wasn’t the  kind of dinner date I had been looking for!

Our episode begins with the person in the story, no t me, talking about how he’s tired of being single.  “To be single” means not to  be married or dating anyone, not involved in a romantic relationship.  I am marr ied, “happily married” we’d say, so this isn’t me, but the person in the story says that all of his friends had paired up.  “To pair (pair) up” is a two-word phrasal verb  meaning to become involved in a romantic relationship, to no longer be single.  T he person in the story was left hanging.  “To be left hanging” means to remain want ing to do something or have something but you don’t have it; other people have it, but you don’t.  So, everyone in your group gets a ticket but you don’t;  you’re left hanging, you are the one who doesn’t get what everyone else gets.  H e says that like everybody else these days (nowadays; during this time), “I tr ied using the Internet to find other singles, but I never had any luck.  Cruising for my ideal woman,” he says, “among a bunch of lonely hearts is like looking for  a needle in a haystack.”  “To cruise (cruise) for women” is a term that used to m ean only you were looking to find women for a sexual relationship.  It, here, is  used a little more broadly, a little more generally, to mean trying to find a woman who will be your new romantic partner.  You could go to a bar or a disco – do we still call them discos?  A dance club, I guess we call them.  I guess I’m really old , calling them discos! Uh…anyway, going to places where young, single wome n might be, and trying to find one of them, and hope that one of them becomes  a romantic partner.

The person in the story, who really needs a name do n’t you think?  Let’s call him Bill.  Bill is saying that he doesn’t want to cruis e for his “ideal” or perfect woman among a bunch of lonely hearts.  The term “lonely” means alone, by yourself; “lonely hearts” refers to people who are single, bu t they feel alone and they want to find a romantic partner.  They’re not happy bein g single.  “Lonely hearts” is a old term, but it’s still used.

He thinks, Bill, that cruising for ideal women on t he Internet was like looking for needles in a haystack.  The expression “to find a n eedle (needle) in a haystack” means to find something very difficult, something t hat’s very difficult to find because it isn’t very common, it’s very rare.  A “n eedle” is a small piece of metal you use, for example, for sewing, when you are repa iring a piece of clothing.  Or, a “needle” is also what we call the thing the docto r puts in you to give you some medicine; they stick the sharp, thin, long needle i nto your arm, or somewhere else, and they are able to give you the medicine th at way.  So, a “needle” is very small, very thin, very difficult to find.  A “hayst ack” is a large pile of hay.  “Hay” is dry grass or other kinds of plants that you will fi nd usually on a farm.  The hay is all put on top of each other, and, of course, to tr y to find a needle, if you put it into the haystack, would be almost impossible.  So that’ s the expression, “to find a needle in a haystack.”

So, what Bill is saying is that cruising for his id eal woman among a bunch of lonely hearts is like looking for a needle in a hay stack; it’s almost impossible.  He says, “I needed another strategy,” I needed another  plan, another approach.  “I finally hit on a brilliant idea.”  “To hit on (some thing)” here means to find someone, to discover something, or to realize somet hing.  Usually it’s used when talking about an idea or a solution to a problem.  Ironically, there’s another meaning of “hit on,” which is when a man or a woman  tries to get another man or a woman interested in them romantically.  They star t talking to them and smiling at them and making jokes.  This could be a way of h itting on a woman.  But here, we’re not talking about that informal use of the ex pression; this is a phrasal verb meaning to suddenly find a new idea or a solution t o a problem.  Bill says, “I would find places where women – single women natura lly (or normally) congregate and simply show up.”  “To congregate” is  when a group of people come together.  We talk about the members of, for e xample, a church as a “congregation,” they all come together; they all me et at a certain place.

Bill is going to try to find places where single wo men would go, and he will then simply show up.  “To show up” is a phrasal verb mea ning to go somewhere without plans, without making special arrangements,  often without getting the permission of the people who are there.  They don’t  know you’re going to be there; suddenly you “show up,” you arrive, you appe ar.  It doesn’t always have to be unplanned; you could say, “I went to the café to  meet a woman I found on the Internet, but she never showed up.”  Actually, it w asn’t a woman, it was a man; you just didn’t realize it because it was the Inter net.  You see, you got to be careful!

Anyway, this is Bill’s great idea.  He says that it  may turn out – it may result that this is a wild goose chase, but he was willing to g ive it a shot.  The expression “wild goose (goose) chase” (chase) means to try to do something that you are not successful in doing because it is difficult or impossible or was a bad idea or strategy to begin with.  In other words, you never should have tried to do it; it was an impossible task.  A “goose” is, you may know, a kind of bird.  Bill says that he was willing, however, to give it a shot.  The expre ssion “to give (something) a shot” means to try to do something even when you kn ow you probably will not be successful, or when you don’t expect to succeed or to do it.  He says that he decided to take a jewelry-making class.  “Jewelry” is like rings and necklaces, things that you would wear.  He’s taking a class on  how to make your own jewelry, and he says that since women love jewelry this is a great place for him to find single women, and therefore to try to find his  ideal woman.

He arrives at the class a few minutes after it star ts so he could make a grand entrance.  “To make a grand entrance” is to enter a  room at a certain time or in a

certain way so that everyone notices you.  This is true if you are going into a room where there are a lot of people; you will do s omething so that everyone knows that you are in the room or that you are comi ng into the room.  Bill says when he walked in, however, he got the shock of his  life.  “The shock of your life” is some very unexpected, powerful surprise, somethi ng that surprises you in a big way.  He says that the room was full of single women all right, meaning it was definitely full of single women.  The expression “a ll right” (two words) is used to emphasize that something is true or correct.  Take a look at the Learning Guide for some additionally uses of this term or based on  this term.  So Bill is saying yes, there were a lot of single women there, but no ne of them was under, or less than, the age of 70; they were all 70 years old or more.

He says they were definitely glad to see him.  He e ven received, or got, a couple of invitations to dinner; the women asked him to go  to dinner with them.  He says, “But to be honest, that wasn’t the kind of dinner d ate I had been looking for!”  A “dinner date” is an invitation to eat dinner with a nother person, often hoping that this will be something that will begin a romantic r elationship or make your romantic relationship stronger.  Obviously, Bill wa s not interested in dating women over the age of 70!

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

I was tired of being single.  All of my friends had  paired up and I was left hanging. Like everybody else these days, I tried using the I nternet to find other singles, but I never had any luck.  Cruising for my ideal woman among a bunch of lonely hearts is like looking for a needle in a haystack.  I needed another strategy.

I finally hit on a brilliant idea.  I would find pl aces where single women naturally congregate and simply show up.  It may turn out to be a wild goose chase, but I was willing to give it a shot.

That’s how I decided to take a jewelry-making class  at the community center.  I may not know much, but I do know that two things th at naturally go together are women and jewelry.

I got to the class a few minutes late so I could ma ke a grand entrance.  But when I walked in, I got the shock of my life.  The room was full of single women all right, but not one of them was under the age of 70!

They were definitely glad to see me.  I even receiv ed a couple of invitations to dinner that day.  But to be honest, that wasn’t the  kind of dinner date I had been looking for!

# Attending an Auction

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 703: Attending an Auction.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 703.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Download a Learning Gui de for this episode, and help support this episode by becoming a member of E SL Podcast.

This episode is called “Attending an Auction.”  An “auction” is where you try to buy things by offering or saying that you will pay more money than the other people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Diane:  This is so exciting!  I’ve never been to an  auction before.

Martin:  Sit down.  It’s about to start.  The aucti oneer is on the podium with her gavel and she’s ready to start the bidding.

Diane:  Are you bidding on the first lot?

Martin:  No, the reserve is too high.  See?  The op ening bid is over 10,000 dollars.  I’m not surprised.  Items of that quality  don’t appear on the auction block very often.

Diane:  What are those people doing on the phone?

Martin:  They are bidding on behalf of people who c an’t be here, the absentee bidders.  Hey, stop waving that paddle around!  The  auctioneer is going to think that you’re placing a bid.

Diane:  Oh, sorry.  Listen, the price is up to 30,5 00 dollars.  Going, going, gone! The auction house is going to make a nice commissio n on that one.  This is so much fun!

Martin:  Shhh!  I’m going to bid on the next lot.  Where is the paddle?

Diane:  The paddle?

 Martin:  Yeah, the paddle.  Where did you put it?

Diane:  I had it just a minute ago.

Martin:  Find it, or else I’m putting your head on the block.

Diane:  The auction block?

Martin:  No, the chopping block!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Diane saying to Martin, “T his is so exciting!  I’ve never been to an auction before.”  An “auction” (auction)  is a place where things are sold to people who will pay more than the other peo ple who are there.  You can go to an auction for art, for cars, for land, for r eally anything that can legally be sold.  That’s an auction.  I say, “I’m going to pay  10 dollars,” you say, “I’ll pay 11 dollars,” I say, “Okay, I am going to pay 12 dollar s,” and so forth.

Martin says to Diane, “Sit down.  It’s about to sta rt.”  An auction – many auctions, anyway, are held in a room and there are people sit ting there, and each person is given a number on something called a “paddle,” whic h we’ll talk about in a second, and they hold that number up if they want t o buy the item.  Martin says to Diane, “Sit down.  It’s about to start.  The auc tioneer” – the person whose job it is to lead the auction, to announce what’s being so ld, and to ask people how much they want to pay – “The auctioneer is on the p odium with her gavel.”  A “podium” (podium) is an area that is higher up than  the surrounding floor, where a speaker will stand so that people can hear him or  her.  Professors in college or teachers in high school often have podiums; they pu t their paper on the podium and they stand behind it facing or looking out towa rd the class.  The auctioneer has something called a “gavel” (gavel).  A “gavel” is like a small hammer – wooden hammer that you hit against the table to get  people’s attention.  In a courtroom, where there is a judge, the judge typica lly has a gavel.  At an auction, a gavel’s purpose is to indicate that the thing tha t they are selling has been sold, that you cannot try to buy it after that point.  Ma rtin says the auctioneer is ready to start the bidding.  “Bidding” comes from the ver b “to bid” (bid).  “To bid” is to say that you are going to pay a certain amount of m oney for something at an auction.  “Bidding” is the process of many people t aking turns announcing how much they’re willing to pay for something.  Here in  the United States, the most popular online auction is eBay (eBay).com.  People say, “I’ll give you 10 dollars,” “Oh, I’ll give you 10.50,” “Okay, I’ll give you 11 dollars.”  Those are two different

people; you wouldn’t, you know, want to bid against  yourself.  That is, offer prices higher than your own price.  That would be crazy!

Speaking of crazy, Diane says, “Are you bidding on the first lot?”  Here, the word “lot” (lot) means a group of objects – a group of t hings that are sold together at an auction.  “Lot” has a lot of different meanings;  take a look at our Learning Guide for more explanations.

Martin says, “No,” he’s not bidding on the first lo t, “the reserve is too high.”  The “reserve” at an auction is the minimum price at whi ch something will be sold.  So, I give my computer to the auctioneer, I say to him,  “Sell this computer, but I will not accept anything less than 400 dollars.”  That’s  the reserve, the 400 dollars, the minimum I will accept.  The auctioneers typical ly keep a percentage for themselves, of course, usually around 30 percent I think.  Anyway, Martin says, “The opening bid is over 10,000 dollars.”  The “ope ning bid” is the bid that the auctioneer proposes or suggests as the first price.   After the auctioneer suggests a price and someone says, “Okay, I’ll pay that,” the auctioneer doesn’t suggest any other prices.  They will, instead, ask people i f they’re willing to pay more.  So if you say, “I’m going to pay 10,000 dollars,” I’ll  say, “Okay, 10,000 dollars.  Do I hear 11,000?”  “Do I hear” means is there anyone wh o will say they will pay 11,000, and someone may say yes.  You say, “Okay, 1 1,000, 11,000, 11,000. Do I hear 12,000?  12,000, 12,000, 12,000…”  For so me reason, auctioneers like to talk and repeat things very fast.

So in our story, the opening bid is over 10,000 dol lars for the first lot.  Martin says, “I’m not surprised.  Items of that quality do n’t appear on the auction block very often.”  The expression an “auction block” ref ers to a raised area where you can see the thing being displayed – the thing that is being sold.  In general, the expression means available at an auction or to be a uctioned.

Diane says, “What are those people doing on the pho ne?”  Martin says, “They are bidding on behalf of people who can’t be here.”   “On behalf of” means to do something for someone else.  So if there’s an aucti on in Paris, and I can’t be there, I send a friend of mine, and the friend will  bid on something and talk to me on the phone and say, “Do you want to pay 11,000?” and I say, “no,” or “yes,” and then that’s how I can participate in the auctio n.  He says – Martin – the absentee bidders are talking on the phone.  The “ab sentee” is the person who isn’t there; they are absent.  “To be absent” is the opposite of “to be present.”  If you’re “present,” you’re here; if you’re “absent,” you’re not here.  At school, we talk about people being present in class or absent from class.  Notice, present “in” class, absent “from” class; the prepositions a re different.  So, these are “absentee bidders,” people who are not physically t here.

 Martin says, “Hey, stop waving that paddle around!”   “To wave” is to move back and forth in the air.  A “paddle” is a flat, round or square piece of wood that has a number on it.  If you are familiar with the game of  ping-pong, or table tennis, the ball is hit with a small paddle.  It looks little l ike that kind of paddle.  It has a handle on it where you can pick it up with your han d, and if you hold it up in the air that tells the auctioneer that you’re willing t o pay that higher price.  So, the auctioneer doesn’t know your name, but he can see y our number, and he writes that number down saying, “Okay, that person will pa y 11,000.”  Well Diane, the dummy, she starts waving the paddle around.  Martin  says, “The auctioneer is going to think that you’re placing a bid.”  “To pla ce a bid” means the same as “to bid,” to say that you will pay a certain price for something.

Diane says, “Oh, sorry.  Listen, the price is up to  30,500 dollars.  Going, going, gone!”  After the auctioneer decides that no one el se will pay a higher price, he or she will say that phrase, “going, going, gone,” and  when they say “gone,” they take the gavel, the little hammer, and they hit the  table to indicate that that item is sold.  Diane says, “The auction house (the company that runs the auction) is going to make a nice commission on that one.”  A “c ommission” is a percentage of the sales price that you receive for selling a c ertain thing.  We talk about people at stores “working on commission,” meaning t hey will get a percentage of the price.  Many salesmen and saleswomen are workin g on commission.

Diane says, “This is so much fun!”  Martin indicate s for her to stop talking, to be quiet.  He says, “Shhh!  I’m going to bid on the ne xt lot,” the next group of things. “Where is the paddle?” he asks.  Diane says, “The p addle?”  Martin says, “Yeah, the paddle.  Where did you put it?”  Where did you place it?  Diane says, “I had it just a minute ago.”  She had the paddle just 60 sec onds ago.  Martin says, “Find it, or else I’m putting your head on the block.”  “ Or else” is a phrase used to show another person that you have to do what I am tellin g you to do or there will be negative consequences.  You don’t even have to say what those negative actions will be.  You might say, “Give me my pen ba ck, or else,” meaning if you do not give me my pen back bad things will happen t o you.  Of course, some people will say, “Or else what?” asking specificall y.  “Or else, I will punch you in the nose,” I will hit you in the face.

In this case, Martin says if Diane can’t find the p addle, he’s going to put her head on the block.  The “block” is also a term we can us e to talk about when they used to kill people by cutting, or “chopping” we would s ay, off their head.  We would call the place where you put your head down the “ch opping block.”  It would be a large piece of wood that would hold your head until  the person chopped it or cut it off.  Well, that’s what Martin is saying he’s going  to do to Diane, which of course

would be illegal in most countries.  You can’t just  go killing people!  Diane says, “The auction block?”  She’s confused; she’s not sur e where her head will be. Martin says, “No, the chopping block!” which is wha t we just explained.  In general, the expression “on the chopping block” mea ns that you are risking something valuable; you may lose something valuable .  Or a company might say, “The employees are on the chopping block,” they are  in risk of losing their jobs.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Diane:  This is so exciting!  I’ve never been to an  auction before.

Martin:  Sit down.  It’s about to start.  The aucti oneer is on the podium with her gavel and she’s ready to start the bidding.

Diane:  Are you bidding on the first lot?

Martin:  No, the reserve is too high.  See?  The op ening bid is over 10,000 dollars.  I’m not surprised.  Items of that quality  don’t appear on the auction block very often.

Diane:  What are those people doing on the phone?

Martin:  They are bidding on behalf of people who c an’t be here, the absentee bidders.  Hey, stop waving that paddle around!  The  auctioneer is going to think you’re placing a bid.

Diane:  Oh, sorry.  Listen, the price is up to 30,5 00 dollars.  Going, going, gone! The auction house is going to make a nice commissio n on that one.  This is so much fun!

Martin:  Shhh!  I’m going to bid on the next lot.  Where is the paddle?

Diane:  The paddle?

Martin:  Yeah, the paddle.  Where did you put it?

Diane:  I had it just a minute ago.

Martin:  Find it, or else I’m putting your head on the block.

 Diane:  The auction block?

Martin:  No, the chopping block!

# Reselling Products for Profit

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 704: Reselling Products for a Profit.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 704.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Reselling Products (reselli ng things) For Profit.”  It’s a dialogue between Jessie and Masa about people who b uy things and then sell them to other people for a higher price.  Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Jessie:  Where are you going?

Masa:  I’m going to stand in line to get one of the  first iDopes.  They go on sale this morning at 9 a.m.

Jessie:  Why don’t you just wait a couple of days w hen there’ll be no line?

Masa:  I’m sure they’re going to sell out, and plus , I’m going to buy an extra one so I can resell it.

Jessie:  You’re going to resell it?  Oh, you mean l ike scalping tickets.

Masa:  You got it.  I can put a markup on it and ma ke a nice little profit.

Jessie:  You mean you’re going to jack up the price .

Masa:  I’m not gouging anybody.  I’m just putting a  little premium on a product that’s in demand.

Jessie:  But what if they don’t sell out?  Won’t yo u be stuck with an extra iDope?

Masa:  I won’t have any problems unloading it.  Tru st me, this is a simple case of supply and demand.  I’ve got the supply and there’s  a big demand.  Hey, where are you going?

Jessie:  I’m going with you.  You’re not the only o ne in this house who wants to earn a little extra dough.

Masa:  I didn’t say you could go with me.

Jessie:  Why can’t I?

Masa:  Because then I’d be helping you to junk up t he market.  And that would be shooting myself in the foot.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Jessie saying to Masa, “Wh ere are you going?”  Masa says, “I’m going to stand in line to get one of the  first iDopes.”  “To stand in line” means to stand with many other people, one in front  of the other, waiting to do something, waiting to get into some place.  You may  stand in line at the grocery store, waiting for the person in front of you to fi nish.  Masa is standing in line to buy one of the first iDopes.  This, of course, is n ot a real electronic product like an iPhone or an iPad.  A “dope” is, when it’s a per son, a stupid person.  You say to someone, “Boy, he’s a real dope,” you mean that person is really stupid.  It’s an insulting term, obviously.  “Dope” as a noun wou ld be a drug, like cocaine or heroin, something that you would take to get high –  to get intoxicated.

So, Masa is going to buy this electronic piece of e quipment called an iDope.  He says, “They go on sale this morning at 9 a.m.”  “To  go on sale” means they become available for people to buy them.  That expr ession, “on sale,” is ambiguous – it can have two meanings.  One is that the store is selling it at a discount, at a lower price than normal.  The other is simply that they’re selling it. Especially when we talk about new products – new th ings, we may talk about “go on sale” to indicate the day or the time when they are available to be purchased, when you can buy them.

Jessie says to Masa, “Why don’t you just wait a cou ple of days when there’ll be no line?”  In other words, if you wait a few days y ou can go and by one without having to wait in line.  Masa says, “I’m sure they’ re going to sell out.”  “To sell out” here means for a store to sell all of the prod uct – all of the particular product that it has.  So, if the store is selling coffee, a nd everyone comes in and buys the coffee, and now there’s no more coffee to buy, we w ould say “the coffee is sold

out,” or “the store has sold out of coffee.”  Masa is sure that the iDopes are going to sell out; they’re going to go quickly.  “And plu s,” he says (in addition), “I’m going to buy an extra one so I can resell it.”  I s hould mention that “sell out” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at the Le arning Guide for some additional explanations.  “To resell” means to buy something from a store, especially something that everyone wants to get and  is difficult to buy, and sell it to someone else at a higher price.  This is somethi ng that happens online – on the Internet all the time.

Masa wants to resell the iDope.  Jessie says, “You’ re going to resell it?  Oh, you mean like scalping tickets.”  “To scalp (scalp) tic kets” means to buy tickets for a concert or a sporting event – a game – at the regul ar price and then sell it to someone else at a higher price.  In some states in the United States scalping is illegal, not in California.  So “scalping” is consi dered by some people to be unethical, but most of us understand that when you have something that’s valuable you can usually sell it for a higher price .

Masa says, “You got it,” meaning that’s right, exac tly.  “I can put a markup on it and make a nice little profit.”  A “markup” (one wo rd) is an increase in the price when you sell it to someone else, it’s how much you  are raising or increasing the price.  If you buy something for 5 dollars and you sell it to someone else for 10 dollars, there was a 5-dollar markup.  So, Masa say s he can make a nice, or a good, profit.  “Nice little” doesn’t necessarily me ans small; it means a pretty good profit.  A “profit” is, of course, the amount of mo ney you make between selling and buying.  You don’t always make a profit; someti mes you lose money.  A profit is when you get more money than you paid for  the item or the materials.

Jessie says, “You mean you’re going to jack up the price.”  “To jack up the price” means to increase the price of something, to make s omething more expensive. However, it’s normally used as a way of criticizing ; it’s a negative way of expressing the idea.  If you say, “Oh, the store ja cked up their prices,” or “The gas stations jacked up their prices after the price  of oil went up,” you’re really saying that they are taking advantage of you in som e way.  So, it’s a negative way to express the idea.  And, you notice that Masa  responds by saying, “I’m not gouging anybody.”  “To gouge” (gouge) here means to  hurt someone by charging a very high price.  So you buy something for a doll ar and you sell it to someone else for 50 dollars, some people would say you are gouging them, you are charging them way too much money.  Masa says he’s n ot doing that; he says, “I’m just putting a little premium on a product tha t’s in demand.”  “Premium” here means a little extra, an additional amount of somet hing.  “Premium” has other uses in English, those can be found in our Learning  Guide, of course.  The product, the iDope, is in demand.  “To be in demand ” means people want it, it’s

desirable.  Masa is defending himself against this criticism that he is gouging or jacking up prices.

Jessie says, “But what if they don’t sell out?”  Th at is, what if there are lots of iDopes.  She says, “Won’t you be stuck with an extr a iDope?”  “To be stuck with (something)” means to have something that is not de sirable, but that you cannot get rid of, you can’t get someone else to take from  you.  Masa says, “I won’t have any problems unloading it.”  “To unload” (unload) m eans here to sell something, to get rid of something.  To be able to sell someth ing to other people who want to buy it, that’s “unloading it” when we’re talking ab out selling things.  “Unload” can also mean to take furniture from a truck or a car a nd put it down on the ground or into your house, that can be “unloading” as well.  The opposite would be “loading,” putting things on the truck or in a car.   But here, it means selling.  Masa says, “Trust me, this is a simple case of supply an d demand.”  A “simple” case means it’s not complicated; this is just a case or an example of supply and demand.  “Supply and demand” refer to how much peop le want something, their demand, and how much or how available is the supply  of that something – how much is available.  “Supply and demand” is part of basic economic theory; it tries to explain why you have prices the way you do, espe cially in a free-market economy.  But we won’t go into all of that; you’ll have to take a course in economics if you want to understand that.  Masa say s, “I’ve got the supply (meaning I have the supply; I have the products) an d there’s a big demand,” there are lots of people who want to buy them.

Masa then says, “Hey, where are you going?”  Jessie  says, “I’m going with you. You’re not the only one in this house who wants to earn a little extra dough.” “Dough” (dough) is an informal term for money.  So,  Jessie is going to buy an iDope and resell it also, even though she was just criticizing Masa for doing the same thing.

Masa says, “I didn’t say you could go with me.”  Je ssie says, “Why can’t I?” Masa says, “Because then I’d be helping you to junk  up the market.”  The expression “to junk (junk) up the market” relates t o the idea that if there are too many people selling something – that is, if the sup ply increases, price will go down; people won’t pay a high price if they can get  it for less somewhere else. So, “to junk up the market” means, again, to increa se the supply of something so that the price of that something goes down.  Masa s ays, “that would be shooting myself in the foot.”  This is an expression, “to sh oot yourself in the foot,” meaning to hurt yourself, to do something that will be bad for you.  So if you want to meet girls and you decide never to wash your hair and to  eat a lot of garlic, well, you’re shooting yourself in the foot.  Not a lot of girls are going to want to talk to you perhaps if you have dirty hair.  That’s why I don’t  have any hair, you see.  I don’t

have to worry about that problem.  Oh, and I’m marr ied, too, so that really means it’s not a problem for me!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jessie:  Where are you going?

Masa:  I’m going to stand in line to get one of the  first iDopes.  They go on sale this morning at 9 a.m.

Jessie:  Why don’t you just wait a couple of days w hen there’ll be no line?

Masa:  I’m sure they’re going to sell out, and plus , I’m going to buy an extra one so I can resell it.

Jessie:  You’re going to resell it?  Oh, you mean l ike scalping tickets.

Masa:  You got it.  I can put a markup on it and ma ke a nice little profit.

Jessie:  You mean you’re going to jack up the price .

Masa:  I’m not gouging anybody.  I’m just putting a  little premium on a product that’s in demand.

Jessie:  But what if they don’t sell out?  Won’t yo u be stuck with an extra iDope?

Masa:  I won’t have any problems unloading it.  Tru st me, this is a simple case of supply and demand.  I’ve got the supply and there’s  a big demand.  Hey, where are you going?

Jessie:  I’m going with you.  You’re not the only o ne in this house who wants to earn a little extra dough.

Masa:  I didn’t say you could go with me.

Jessie:  Why can’t I?

Masa:  Because then I’d be helping you to junk up t he market.  And that would be shooting myself in the foot.

Her dialogues are always in demand; everyone wants to get a copy.  That’s because I’m talking about our own scriptwriter, Dr.  Lucy Tse.





# An Exclusive Guest List

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 705: An Exclusive Guest List.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 705.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development – I almost forgot there – in beautiful Los Angeles, Cal ifornia.

Our website is www.eslpod.com.  Go there and become  a member of ESL Podcast and help support this podcast.  By becoming  a member you will also receive a Learning Guide, an 8- to 10-page guide we  provide for each episode of the podcast.

This episode is called “An Exclusive Guest List.”  A “guest list” is a list of people you are going to invite to a party.  Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Catherine:  Do you have a draft of the guest list?  We need to get the invitations out next week.

Ralph:  It’s not quite done yet.  I keep going back  and forth about a few people I’m not sure about, like Lacy Say.

Catherine:  Lacy Say?  She’s a has-been.  She hasn’ t been in a movie for years. We only want people on the A-list at this party.

Ralph:  What about Jess McGillan?  I’m on the fence  about him.

Catherine:  He’s definitely a D-lister.  This party  is very exclusive and we don’t want any D-listers rubbing elbows with VIPs.

Ralph:  I understand that, but what if we don’t get  enough A-listers to come?

Catherine:  That will not happen.  This party has t o be a success!

Ralph:  And if we don’t have enough guests because we’ve excluded so many D- list celebrities?

Catherine:  There will always be gatecrashers.  We can let in a few to buff up the numbers, if push comes to shove.

 Ralph:  What happens to the exclusivity of the part y if that happens?

Catherine:  If that happens, this party has bombed and I don’t care if we even let in podcasters!

[end of dialogue]

Catherine begins our dialogue by saying to Ralph, “ Do you have a draft of the guest list?”  A “draft” (draft) of a list or a lett er or any other document is an early version of something; it’s not complete, it’s not f inal.  In school you often, especially in a literature class, will have to writ e essays and papers.  Usually you start with a first draft; you start writing it and then you go and you change it, that’s your second draft, and maybe even a third draft and  so forth until you get to the final draft.  So Catherine is asking Ralph if he ha s a draft of the guest list.  A “guest list” is a list of people that you are invit ing to a party.  I should mention that “draft” has some other meanings in English as well;  take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Catherine says, “We need to get the invitations out  next week,” we need to mail or send the invitations next week.  An “invitation”  is a card or a letter asking you to come to a party.  It could be for a wedding, it could be because someone is graduating, or just because you’re having a party –  you’re a party kind of person, you like to party.  Well, Catherine’s a real partie r.  Ralph says, “It’s not quite done yet (meaning the guest list is not finished yet).  I keep going back and forth about a few people I’m not sure about, like Lacy Say.”  “ To go back and forth” means to be unable to make a decision, or to think that some thing is right and then later to change your mind and think that it’s wrong; constan tly or continually going back and forth.  Is it right?  Is it wrong?  Should I in vite him?  Should I not invite him? That’s going back and forth.

Ralph is going back and forth about inviting a woma n named Lacy Say. Catherine says, “Lacy Say?  She’s a has-been.”  A “ has-been” (been) is someone who was well known and popular a long time ago, but is not popular or is not important anymore.  It’s an insulting way of  referring to someone. Catherine says Lacy Say is a has-been, “She hasn’t been in a movie for years,” so she’s obviously an actress.  She says, “We only want people on the A-list at this party.”  The “A-list” would be the most popula r, the best-known performers, especially actors and singers.  The “B-list” would be actors and singers who aren’t very good, and so forth.

Ralph says, “What about Jess McGillan?  I’m on the fence about him.”  “To be on the fence” means to be unable to make a decision be cause you see the good and the bad of each possibility.

So, Ralph is on the fence about Jess McGillan.  Cat herine says, “He’s definitely a D-lister.”  To be a “D-lister” is to be someone on the D-list, meaning an actor or singer who isn’t very well-known, who no one has ev er heard of – and who has ever heard of Jess McGillan anyway?  Catherine says , “This party is very exclusive and we don’t want any D-listers rubbing e lbows with VIPs.”  When you say something is “exclusive” you mean that it is av ailable for only a small group of people, people who are famous or rich or popular .  That would be something exclusive, only a small number of people can go or be a part of that event.

Catherine says, “we don’t want any D-listers rubbin g elbows with VIPs.”  “To rub (rub) elbows with (someone)” means to spend time at  a party or some event with someone who is famous, rich, and/or powerful.  I wa s at a Starbucks near one of the movie studios, and when you go there to drink c offee or tea you can sometimes rub elbows with famous actors and actress es, because they come in and get their coffee there.  When I go there, I can  rub elbows with famous actors. Unfortunately, I don’t recognize actors very well, so when they come in I don’t know who they are.  So, I’ve never really rubbed el bows, although once I did meet a actress who I did not recognize, but someone  else told me who she was. I think that was Neve Campbell, who was a televisio n star in the 1990s here in the United States.  Anyway, moving on.  Catherine d oesn’t want any of these less important rubbing elbows or talking and meetin g with VIPs.  A “VIP” is a very important person, someone with a lot of power or in fluence.

Ralph says, “I understand that, but what if we don’ t get enough A-listers to come?”  What if we can’t get enough people to our p arty?  Catherine says, “That will not happen.  This party has to be (must be) a success!”  Ralph says, “And if we don’t have enough guests because we’ve excluded so many D-list celebrities?”  “To exclude” is related to the word “exclusive.”  “To exclude” means not to allow someone to come to your party or parti cipate in something.  It’s the opposite of “include,” which means to allow someone  to be part of your group or to do something.  Ralph is worried that they will n ot have enough people to come to the party if they exclude a lot of D-listers, the less famous actors and celebrities.  A “celebrity” is just anyone who’s ve ry famous, especially a singer or an actor or a podcaster.  Those three are usually w hat we talk about when we refer to celebrities!

So, Catherine says, “There will always be gatecrash ers.”  A “gatecrasher” is a person who goes to a party even though they were no t invited; they just go to the

party and show up.  They arrive, and even without a n invitation, they go into the party.  She says, “We can let in a few (a few gatec rashers; a few people who weren’t invited) to buff up the numbers, if push co mes to shove.”  “To buff (buff) up” is a phrasal verb meaning to improve something,  to make it slightly better; when we’re talking about numbers, to increase the n umbers of something. Catherine talks about buffing up the numbers, meani ng the number of people at the party.  They can do this if push comes to shove .  This is an old expression; “if push comes to shove” indicates that you will do som ething if the situation becomes very bad or difficult, and it becomes neces sary to do it even if you don’t want to.  You might say, “I’m going to buy somethin g at the store and I want to use my credit card.  But if I have a problem with m y credit card, if push comes to shove, I can also pay with cash.”  So Catherine is saying if push comes to shove they can buff up their numbers by letting in gatecr ashers.

Ralph says, “What happens to the exclusivity of the  party if that happens?”  Then the party won’t be exclusive anymore.  Catherine sa ys, “If that happens, this party has bombed.”  “To bomb,” as a verb, here mean s to fail very badly, to do a very poor job.  We especially use this when talking  about a performance; we might say, “The latest movie by Tom Cruise bombed,”  or “That new song by Jennifer Lopez bombed.”  It did not do very well; it was not very popular. Catherine says if the party is not exclusive it wil l have bombed, and I don’t care if that happens – “I don’t care if we even let in podc asters!” meaning that would be the lowest, least popular person that we would want  to come to our party. Obviously they’re not talking about all podcasters.   I think Catherine here is referring to the less popular podcasters.  I think that’s what – I think that’s what the scriptwriter meant!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Catherine:  Do you have a draft of the guest list?  We need to get the invitations out next week.

Ralph:  It’s not quite done yet.  I keep going back  and forth about a few people I’m not sure about, like Lacy Say.

Catherine:  Lacy Say?  She’s a has-been.  She hasn’ t been in a movie for years. We only want people on the A-list at this party.

Ralph:  What about Jess McGillan?  I’m on the fence  about him.

Catherine:  He’s definitely a D-lister.  This party  is very exclusive and we don’t want any D-listers rubbing elbows with VIPs.

Ralph:  I understand that, but what if we don’t get  enough A-listers to come?

Catherine:  That will not happen.  This party has t o be a success!

Ralph:  And if we don’t have enough guests because we’ve excluded so many D- list celebrities?

Catherine:  There will always be gatecrashers.  We can let in a few to buff up the numbers, if push comes to shove.

Ralph:  What happens to the exclusivity of the part y if that happens?

Catherine:  If that happens, this party has bombed and I don’t care if we even let in podcasters!

[end of dialogue]

She’s no has-been; she’s an A-lister when it comes to scriptwriters here in Hollywood, that’s our own Dr. Lucy Tse I’m talking about.





# Feeling Ill from Food While Traveling

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 706: Feeling Ill from Food While Traveling.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 706.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English – and your  love life!

This episode is called “Feeling Ill (or sick) from Food While Traveling.”  Sounds like fun!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rumi:  I’m as sick as a dog!

Hugo:  It serves you right.  I warned you not to ea t food sold by food vendors on the street.  Cleanliness is not a priority at some of those food stands.

Rumi:  I’m not one to turn up my nose up at street food.  On the street is where you’ll find the most authentic food, the food the l ocals eat.  And plus, I have a stomach of steel.

Hugo:  You had a stomach of steel, and there’s no w ay to guard against undercooked or contaminated food.

Rumi:  Okay, you’re right.

Hugo:  It’ll probably take days for whatever it is that’s making you sick to work itself out of your system.  Some vacation!

Rumi:  Just be grateful you’re not puking your guts  out like I am.

Hugo:  Believe me, I’m thanking my lucky stars.

[end of dialogue]

Rumi begins our dialogue by saying, “I’m as sick as  a dog!”  This is an old expression that means to be very sick, to be very i ll: “I’m sick as a dog.”  Hugo

says, “It serves you right.”  The expression or phr ase “it serves you right” means that you deserve the negative consequences that you  are suffering now; you did something wrong, and now you are paying the price.  “It serves you right” implies that you did something wrong, and because you did s omething wrong now you are suffering.  Hugo says, “I warned you’” – meanin g I told you something bad would happen – “I warned you not to eat food sold b y food vendors on the street.”  A “vendor” (vendor) is anyone who sells s omething, but we usually use the term in talking about people selling things fro m small carts or just from their own pockets on the street; that’s one association of the word.  A “food vendor” would be a person who’s selling food on the street,  often from a truck or some small vehicle.  Hugo says, “Cleanliness is not a pr iority at some of those food stands.”  “Cleanliness” means very clean.  He’s say ing that some of the food vendors on the street aren’t very clean, and this i s why Rumi is sick.  He says it’s not a “priority,” meaning it’s not important to the m.

He calls the food vendors “food stands.”  The “stan d” is actually the physical place where the person is selling the food.  A “foo d stand” is small, a place where you have the person keeping the food or perhaps coo king the food, and then selling it to you.  This happens in many cities, no t in Los Angeles very much.  But I know if you go, for example, to New York City the re will be – or used to be, the last time I was there – people selling hot dogs on the streets for example.  And many cities have this custom of selling food on the  streets.  Los Angeles has food trucks that go around and sell different kinds  of food.  Of course, Los Angeles is very much a car culture; that is, everyo ne has a car, and you can’t travel very easily without one.  So logically, the food vendors have trucks rather than just stands on the street.

Rumi says, “I’m not one to turn up my nose up at st reet food.”  The expression “to not turn your nose up at (something)” is a comp licated way of saying that you don’t think that you are too good for something; yo u don’t think that you are better than someone or something.  If you just say,  “I’m a person who turns his nose up at taking the bus,” for example in Los Ange les, that means that you think you’re too good to do that, you are better than oth er people; you are superior, we would say.  Rumi says she’s not someone who turns h er nose up at street food. “On the street is where you’ll find the most authen tic food,” she says, “the food that locals eat.”  “Locals” means people who live i n the area where you are visiting, not tourists; the opposite of a tourist w ould be a local.  In Los Angeles, I’m a local.  If you live in Tokyo, you are a local  in Tokyo.  Rumi says the street is where you find the most authentic food.  “Authentic ” means real, true, something that actually exists.  In this case, really the bes t food, the food that is most like what people in that area or city eat.  “And plus,” Rumi says, “I have a stomach of

steel.”  “To have a stomach of steel,” or simply a “steel stomach,” means that you can eat almost anything and not get sick.

Hugo says, “You had a stomach of steel.”  He’s usin g the verb in the past tense, saying well, maybe you used to in the past but not anymore.  He says, “there’s no way to guard against undercooked or contaminated  food.”  “To guard against (something)” means to protect yourself from somethi ng, to do something to prevent something bad from happening to you.  The b est way to guard yourself against getting sick is to always wash your hands b efore you eat.  That’s just an example; that’s not always true of course, but it’s  a good idea I think.  Hugo says, “there’s no way to guard against undercooked food.”   “Undercooked” food is not cooked enough; it’s food that needs to be cooked mo re.  If it’s not cooked properly, some of the food could be “raw,” meaning uncooked, and some food is dangerous when it is uncooked.  Pork, for example, the meat of a pig, is often unsafe when undercooked.  “Contaminated” food is fo od that has something in it that is not food or that is dangerous.  So for exam ple, if we say the water is “contaminated,” we mean that there is something in the water that should not be there and that will make you sick if you drink it.

Rumi says, “Okay, you’re right,” meaning you are co rrect.  Hugo says, “It’ll probably take days for whatever that is making you sick to work itself out of your system.”  That’s a kind of complicated sentence.  H ugo says it will take days – many days – for this thing that is making you sick,  it’s going to take some time for that to work itself out of your system.  “To work itself out of your system” means for your body to be no longer affected by it.  Real ly, it’s another way of saying it will take a while for you to get better.  Sometimes , sickness caused by a virus or by bacterial infection takes a while to work itself  out of your system, so that you are no longer affected by it.  Hugo says, “Some vac ation!”  Now, “some” is a common word in English, with many meanings, some of  which you can find in our Learning Guide.  Here, however, when used in an exp ression like this, it’s used to mean “not,” or “this is not,” or something that would be negative.  For example, you are going to take a walk in the park, and sudde nly it starts to rain; you might say, “Oh!  Some walk!” meaning this is not a good w alk.  You’re saying that whatever follows the word “some” is bad or is not a s good as you wanted it to be; it’s showing your disappointment.  “Some wedding!  The bride never showed up.” The “bride” is the woman who’s getting married.  “S ome wedding!” meaning, boy, that was a terrible wedding.  In fact, it wasn’t ev en a wedding at all, because the bride did not go – which is always a problem if you ’re getting married!  Some advice from me, who is married, always make sure th at the other person is also there to get married with you, because if they’re n ot, well, you’re going to have some problems!

Rumi says, “Just be grateful you’re not puking your  guts out like I am.”  “Just be grateful” means you should be thankful; you should think yourself fortunate that you are not “puking your guts out.”  This is a rath er ugly phrase; “to puke” (puke) means to vomit, to throw up, when the food that was  in your stomach suddenly goes out your mouth the wrong way.  Your “guts” are  a general way of referring to your stomach or the lower part of your abdomen.  The expression means to be sick a lot, to be vomiting a lot.

Hugo says, “Believe me, I’m thanking my lucky stars .”  This is an old expression; “to thank your lucky stars” means to be very gratef ul for something, to be very appreciative, to be in this case happy that somethi ng bad did not happen to you. Remember that song, I think it was from the 70s?  “ And I thank my lucky stars that you are who you are and not just another…(some thing something) come to break my heart” – something like that.  Remember th at?  No?

Okay, now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time a t a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rumi:  I’m as sick as a dog!

Hugo:  It serves you right.  I warned you not to ea t food sold by food vendors on the street.  Cleanliness is not a priority at some of those food stands.

Rumi:  I’m not one to turn up my nose up at street food.  On the street is where you’ll find the most authentic food, the food the l ocals eat.  And plus, I have a stomach of steel.

Hugo:  You had a stomach of steel, and there’s no w ay to guard against undercooked or contaminated food.

Rumi:  Okay, you’re right.

Hugo:  It’ll probably take days for whatever it is that’s making you sick to work itself out of your system.  Some vacation!

Rumi:  Just be grateful you’re not puking your guts  out like I am.

Hugo:  Believe me, I’m thanking my lucky stars.

[end of dialogue]

We thank our lucky stars that we have the wonderful  Dr. Lucy Tse to write our scripts.  By the way, the song that I was thinking of, that’s James Taylor, “Your Smiling Face,” 1977.  I know, you probably didn’t c are!

From Los Angeles, California, we do care, and I tha nk you for listening.  I know it’s been a weird episode, but I’m hoping that you’ ll come back and listen to us again soon here on ESL Podcast.



# Looking Back on One¡¦s Life

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 707: Looking Back on One’s Life.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 707.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faste r.

This episode is about looking back or thinking abou t one’s life.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nick:  I’m turning 40 this year and what do I have to show for it?

Danielle:  Actually, you’ve accomplished a lot.  Do  you know what your problem is?  Your expectations are too high and your goals are unattainable for most people.

Nick:  Not for me.  They shouldn’t have been.  I ha d my life all planned out and nothing is turning out the way it should.

Danielle:  I would never have pegged you for someon e with regrets about how his life has turned out.

Nick:  But I was supposed to make my first million dollars by the time I was 30. By 35, I should have met someone and settled down, maybe had a child or two. None of that has panned out.

Danielle:  You have lots of friends and a full life .  Maybe things didn’t turn out the way you had imagined, but wouldn’t you say you were  generally content?

Nick:  I was before I started thinking about my upc oming birthday.

Danielle:  Then stop thinking about it.  Too much b rooding could definitely lead to regrets – not to mention premature aging!

[end of dialogue]

Nick begins by saying to Danielle, “I’m turning 40 this year.”  “To turn 40” means to reach the age of 40.  He says, “what do I have t o show for it?”  The expression “What do I have to show for it?” is not an actual q uestion, he is not expecting Danielle to answer; it’s really a question that say s that you are disappointed or unhappy with the results of your actions, that you have done a lot of work but not much has happened.

Danielle says, “Actually, you’ve accomplished a lot .”  “To accomplish” (accomplish) means to achieve something, to do some thing, often something that is difficult.  Danielle says, “Do you know what you r problem is?  Your expectations are too high.”  “Expectations” comes f rom the verb “to expect.”  “To expect” is what you hope for, what you think will h appen.  Your “expectations” are what you think will happen in the future, what you believe should happen.  So if you have high expectations you are expecting a lot of success, for example.  We talk about “high expectations” and “low expectation s.”  Danielle says that Nick’s expectations are too high, higher than they should be, and that his goals are unattainable for most people.  “To attain” (attain)  means to reach or to accomplish something.  “Attainable” would be someth ing that is able to be accomplished, something you can attain.  “Unattaina ble” is something you cannot attain; it doesn’t matter how hard you try, it’s im possible or it’s too difficult.

Nick says, “Not for me,” meaning his expectations, I guess, are not too high.  He says, “They shouldn’t have been.”  I think he’s ref erring to his goals as being unattainable.  He said, “I had my life all planned out and nothing is turning out the way it should.”  “To plan (something) out” is a phr asal verb meaning to have a clear, detailed idea about what you are going to do .  So, Nick said that he had his life all planned out; he knew exactly what he was g oing to do and the order in which he was going to do it, but nothing is turning  out the way it should.  “To turn out” is another phrasal verb meaning to become, to have a certain result, or to end in a particular way.  You may say, “How did the  game turn out?”  That is, who won the game?  What was the final result?  In N ick’s case, he’s talking about all of the things that he planned, but they d idn’t turn out the way they should, the way he wanted them; they did not have t he result that he wanted them to have.

Danielle is trying to be encouraging to Nick, who’s  clearly a little depressed. Maybe he needs a vacation.  I think I need a vacati on!  Anyway, Danielle says, “I would never have pegged you for someone with regret s about how his life has turned out.”  “To peg (peg) (someone)” is to catego rize someone or identify someone, to believe that someone has a certain char acteristic or certain characteristics.  So you might say, “I pegged you f or a football player,” meaning you look big; I looked at you and I thought, “Hmm, that person is a football

player,” that’s one of his characteristics.  In thi s case, Danielle is saying that she did not peg Nick – she did not think about Nick as someone with regrets. “Regrets” (regrets) are feelings of sadness that so mething has happened, or a wish that you could do something over again differe ntly.  Something that is in the past  – that has already happened, you wish you cou ld go back in time and change it; that’s what “regrets” are.  Danielle say s that she didn’t think Nick was someone who would have regrets about how his life h as turned out – what has happened, what has resulted.

Nick says, “But I was supposed to make my first mil lion by the time I was 30 (my first million dollars).”  He’s saying that he thoug ht he would make his first million dollars before he was 30 years old.  “By 35,” he sa ys, “I should have met someone and settled down.”  “To settle down” is a t wo-word phrasal verb meaning usually to get married, to buy a house, or to live a calmer life, perhaps to have children.  We talk about young men and youn g women “settling down,” eventually getting married, no longer going out as much because they have met their husband or wife.  Nick thought he would have met someone and have settled down by the time he was 35.  He says, “None  of that has panned out.” “To pan (pan) out” is similar to the verb “to turn out.”  It’s a phrasal verb meaning to be successful.  “To pan out” is, however, always  something that is successful; “turn out?” could be successful, could be not succe ssful.  But if you say, “Did it pan out?” you mean was it successful, was it what y ou were expecting to happen.  Unfortunately for Nick, his life did not p an out as he thought it would.

Danielle says, “You have lots of friends and a full  (or complete) life.  Maybe things didn’t turn out the way you had imagined, bu t wouldn’t you say you were generally content?”  “To be content” (content) mean s to be happy, to be calm, to be satisfied.  You’re not sad, you’re not disappoin ted; you are relatively happy, basically happy.  There are other meanings of that word; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Nick says, “I was (meaning I was content) before I started thinking about my upcoming birthday.”  “Upcoming” (one word) means sc heduled to happen soon, something that is going to happen very soon.  Nick says that he was content until he started thinking about his 40 th  birthday, his upcoming birthday, which means he’s not yet 40; it hasn’t happened yet.

Danielle says, “Then stop thinking about it (stop t hinking about your birthday). Too much brooding could definitely lead to regrets. ”  “To brood” (brood) means to think about something too much; you’re thinking abo ut it so much that you become worried or sad or depressed, so it’s always a negative thing.  It’s a nice word: “to brood,” to have too much thought about so mething, especially

something that is negative.  Danielle says, “Too mu ch brooding could definitely lead to (or cause) regrets,” so if you brood you’ll  start thinking, “Oh, I wish I had done this,” or “I wish it were different,” that sor t of thing.

Danielle says, “not to mention premature aging!”  T he phrase “not to mention” is used when you want to add an additional thing to yo ur sentence – an additional item.  Let me give you a few examples: “If you go o ut into the sun your skin might become red, not to mention you will be very thirsty .”  “Not to mention” introduces the additional idea.  Or you could say, “If you stu dy hard at school you will get a good job when you are finished, not to mention the satisfaction of knowing that you studied and succeeded.”  “Not to mention” intro duces the additional element of the satisfaction.  In this sentence, Danielle sa ys, “Too much brooding could definitely lead to regrets” – that’s one thing, “no t to mention” – another thing, which is “premature aging.”  “Aging” is the physica l changes that take place when you get older.  “Premature” means before the time t hat you would expect.  If a baby is born before the expected date we may say th at baby was “premature.” Even before he was ready, he came out of his mother ’s womb.  The “womb” is where the baby is before it’s born.  Well, “prematu re aging” would be getting older before you should be getting older, or you lo ok older than you should.  I think that’s happening to me, personally.  I think I am aging prematurely.  People think I’m in my late 40s because of the way I look.   Wait a minute…no, actually I am in my late 40s, so maybe I’m not premature aging .  Maybe I’m just getting old!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nick:  I’m turning 40 this year and what do I have to show for it?

Danielle:  Actually, you’ve accomplished a lot.  Do  you know what your problem is?  Your expectations are too high and your goals are unattainable for most people.

Nick:  Not for me.  They shouldn’t have been.  I ha d my life all planned out and nothing is turning out the way it should.

Danielle:  I would never have pegged you for someon e with regrets about how his life has turned out.

Nick:  But I was supposed to make my first million dollars by the time I was 30. By 35, I should have met someone and settled down, maybe had a child or two. None of that has panned out.

Danielle:  You have lots of friends and a full life .  Maybe things didn’t turn out the way you had imagined, but wouldn’t you say you were  generally content?

Nick:  I was before I started thinking about my upc oming birthday.

Danielle:  Then stop thinking about it.  Too much b rooding could definitely lead to regrets – not to mention premature aging!

[end of dialogue]

We have no regrets about this episode; that’s becau se we think it turned out pretty well, thanks to the wonderful script by our own Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Trademarks and Logos

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 708: Trademarks and Logos.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 708.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Support this podcast by  becoming an ESL Podcast member; more information can be found on our websit e.

This episode is called “Trademarks and Logos.”  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bianca:  Look at this logo I designed for our new l ine of products.

Vien:  That’s really nice, but it looks a lot like our competitor’s logo.  In fact, it’s almost identical.

Bianca:  No, it’s not.  The color is a different sh ade of green, the graphic is smaller, and instead of a picture of a woman, I’m u sing a picture of a man. They’re nothing alike.

Vien:  That’s not what most people would say.  Look ing at your logo and our competitor’s logo side by side, I’d say this was a clear case of trademark infringement.

Bianca:  Okay, to be honest, I purposely made them look a little alike so that customers will associate our products with their br and.  So what?  I don’t think that’s a big deal.

Vien:  Our competitor has exclusive rights to use its logo.  If ours is too similar, the trademark registry and the courts are going to nail us.

Bianca:  So what do you want me to do?

Vien:  Go back to the drawing board – literally!

[end of dialogue]

Bianca begins by saying, “Look at this logo I desig ned for our new line of products.”  A “logo” (logo) is the image used to id entify a company or an organization.  It’s usually what goes above or belo w their name; it’s a special symbol that you recognize that company from.  The s ymbol – the logo for Apple Computer is an apple that has a small bite taken ou t of it.  The logo that Bianca designed is for their new line of products.  A “lin e of products” are a set of related things.  You could have a line of products for shoe s; there would be a number of different kinds or styles of shoes.  “To design” me ans to create some sort of image or shape or style of something.  The person w ho creates the logo – who designs the logo is called a “designer.”

Vien says, “That’s really nice, but it looks a lot like our competitor’s logo.”  Vien is saying that he likes the logo, but it looks like so meone else’s logo, their competitor’s.  A “competitor” (competitor) is a com pany that sells products or services similar to the ones that your company sell s, so the two companies are “competing,” they are trying to get the same custom ers.  Coke and Pepsi are competitors in the world of soft drinks – of sodas.   Vien says, “In fact, (the logo you designed Bianca) is almost identical.”  Somethi ng that is “identical” is the same as something else, there are no differences be tween them.  We talk about identical twins, two boys or two girls that are bor n at the same time, from the same mother, who look exactly alike.  I have two ol der brothers who are identical twins.  One of them is named Mark and the other one  is named Mike, but I don’t know who is who; I still can’t tell them apart.  Th at is, I don’t know which one is Mark and which one is Mike.  Maybe someday!

So, Vien is saying that this logo that Bianca desig ned is almost identical with their competitor’s.  Bianca says, “No, it’s not.  The col or is a different shade of green.” A “shade” is a slight difference in a color; colors  have different shades, small differences.  She says that the logo she designed h as a different shade of green. “The graphic,” she says, “is smaller.”  The “graphi c” is the image, especially an image that is created by a computer.  Often, the wo rd “graphic” is used to describe something that doesn’t have any text – any  lettering, any words on it. She says, “instead of a picture of a woman, I’m usi ng a picture of a man.  They’re nothing alike.”  When we say some things are “nothi ng alike,” we mean they are completely different; they are not similar in any w ay.

Vien says, “That’s not what most people would say,”  meaning if we showed your logo to people outside of our company most of them would say they are identical. Vien says, “Looking at your logo and our competitor ’s logo side by side, I’d say this was a clear case of trademark infringement.”  The expression “side by side” means two things are placed or put right next to ea ch other so that you can look at them and see how they are different and how they  are similar.  Vien is saying if

you take the new logo from Bianca and compare it to  the competitor’s logo, that it would be a case – a clear case of trademark infring ement.  “Trademarks” are official registrations that you make with the gover nment.  Usually a company, after it designs a logo or it has some sort of expr ession that it uses in its advertising, the company will get a trademark for it.  They will ask the government to protect it so that no one else can co py it, no one else can use it. We at ESL Podcast have a trademark.  ESLPod, our we bsite, is trademarked; those six letters together are trademarked.  They a re protected by the U.S. government’s laws, and by extension, international laws.  “To infringe on (something)” means to violate or to break some sort  of rule or law.  So, when we talk about “trademark infringement,” we’re talking about someone who uses illegally – without permission – someone else’s log o or graphic or phrase that the company has protected with their trademark.  Vien t hinks this is a clear case, or a clear example of trademark infringement.

Bianca says, “Okay, to be honest (if I’m telling the truth), I purposely made them look alike – a little alike,” she says, “so that cu stomers will associate our products with their brand.”  “To associate” means to connect  two things, to believe that two things are related.  “Associate” has other meanings  in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of those.  Bianca wants their customers to associate their products, the things t hat they sell, with the other company’s brand.  A “brand” (brand) is the particul ar name and design of a company’s product.  For example, there are differen t brands of tennis shoes; different companies make different kinds of shoes.  One company may have several different brands, several different types t hat go by the same name and have a similar design – if it’s a big company, ofte n the company really has only one brand.  Bianca then says, “So what?” meaning wh o cares, this is not important.  She says, “I don’t think that’s a big d eal,” meaning I don’t think it’s important.

Vien says, “Our competitor has exclusive rights to use its logo.”  “Rights” are your legal abilities to do something.  “Exclusive rights ” are things that only you can do or your company can do.  If the company trademarks a logo, only that company can use the logo; they have exclusive rights, no on e else can use them.  Vien says, “If ours is too similar, the trademark regist ry and the courts are going to nail us.”  The “trademark registry” is the official list  of all of the government registered trademarks; you can go to a website nowadays and lo ok for those.  The “courts” refer to the legal institutions in a country.  “The  courts,” Vien thinks, “are going to nail us (if our logo is too similar to the logo of our competitor’s).”  “To nail (someone)” is an informal expression that here mean s to get someone in trouble or to punish someone for having done something wron g.  If the professor sees

you cheating on an examination, he’s going to nail you; he’s going to get you in a lot of trouble.

Bianca says, “So what do you want me to do?”  Vien replies, “Go back to the drawing board – literally!”  “To go back to the dra wing board” is an expression that means to begin something again.  Now, a “drawi ng board” is where you would draw or design something.  But, the expressio n is normally used in any situation where you’re asking someone to start a pr oject from the beginning, to do it over usually because they’ve done it wrong or  they don’t have a very good idea.  In this case, Bianca actually was using a re al drawing board, and that’s why Vien says at the end of the expression “literal ly.”  “Literally” refers to the actual, direct meaning of words, not a symbolic mea ning of the word.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Bianca:  Look at this logo I designed for our new l ine of products.

Vien:  That’s really nice, but it looks a lot like our competitor’s logo.  In fact, it’s almost identical.

Bianca:  No, it’s not.  The color is a different sh ade of green, the graphic is smaller, and instead of a picture of a woman, I’m u sing a picture of a man. They’re nothing alike.

# Taking Someone for Granted

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 709: Taking Someone for Granted.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 709.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You probably know that,  but did you know that we rely on – we count on your support to keep us going .  Please consider becoming a member of ESL Podcast by going to our website tod ay.

This episode is a conversation between Phil and Cam eron; Cameron is the woman in the dialogue.  It’s about taking someone f or granted, always a dangerous thing in a relationship.  Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Phil:  Did you hear that Melissa has finally left E ric?  It’s about time!

Cameron:  Oh, that’s sad.  It’s always sad when two  people can’t make it work.

Phil:  Well, it wasn’t for a lack of trying, on Mel issa’s part.  She bent over backwards trying to please Eric and he always took her for granted.  If you ask me, Melissa was always too good for him.

Cameron:  Really?  I don’t know Eric too well, but he seemed nice.

Phil:  Yeah, he’s nice on the surface, but he’s rea lly a slimeball.  Trust me, I know.

Cameron:  I believe you, but what’s Melissa going to do now?

Phil:  I think she should find a nice guy who’ll ap preciate her.

Cameron:  Someone like you?

Phil:  She could do worse.  I’d treat her right and  make her happy.

Cameron:  You sound like a man with a plan.

Phil:  “Be prepared.”  Isn’t that what the Boy Scou ts say?

[end of dialogue]

Phil begins by saying to Cameron, “Did you hear tha t Melissa has finally left Eric? It’s about time!”  “Did you hear,” meaning did some one tell you or did you have this information.  The information is that Melissa – a girl, a woman – has finally left Eric.  The expression “to leave (someone),” wh en we’re talking about a romantic relationship, is to end the relationship.  Another way of saying this would be “to break up.”  We often use “to break up”  when we’re talking about two people ending their romantic connection – their rom antic relationship, but you can also simply use the verb “to leave.”  “To leave ” has many other meanings, of course; those can be found – some of them – in our Learning Guide.  Phil says, “It’s about time!”  That’s a phrase to show that yo u are happy, you are relieved that something has finally happened; you would hope d it would happen earlier, but now finally it has happened.  Phil is happy tha t Melissa has left Eric. Cameron says, “Oh, that’s sad.  It’s always sad whe n two people can’t make it work.”  “Make it work” means to try very hard to ma ke something successful. You’ll often hear that when people are talking abou t relationships: “They couldn’t make it work,” meaning they tried but it was not po ssible for them to continue their relationship.

So, Cameron is sad.  Phil says, “Well, it wasn’t for lack of trying, on Melissa’s part.”  He’s saying that Melissa tried to make it w ork.  The expression “not for a lack of trying” is used to mean that someone did tr y very hard; they did attempt to do something, especially something that was difficu lt or perhaps unpleasant.  It’s almost always used in negative: “It’s not for a lac k of trying that I was not able to visit my brother today.”  I tried very hard.  I dro ve many miles, but the weather was bad and I wasn’t able to arrive on time; but it  was not for a lack of trying, meaning I tried very hard.  Phil says that Melissa tried very hard also.  He uses the expression “on Melissa’s part,” which means sim ply by Melissa.  Phil says that Melissa bent over backwards to try to please E ric.  “To bend over backwards” is an expression that means to do everyt hing possible for something to happen, especially when you are trying to make t hings easier for another person.  “Bent” is the past tense of the verb “to b end.”  So, Melissa bent over backwards, she tried very hard to please Eric.  “To  please,” as a verb, means to make someone happy or to make someone satisfied.  “ Please” has other meanings as well, and some of those are in our Learning Guide for this episode.

Phil says that Eric took Melissa for granted.  “To take (someone) for granted” means not to appreciate what another person is doin g, to not appreciate his or her actions or behaviors, to not thank them, to not  recognize that they are doing

something for you.  This is often something that mi ght happen in a relationship: you take the other person for granted.  Husbands, d o not take your wives for granted, they will not be very happy – trust me, I know!  So, Phil says that Eric took Melissa for granted.  He says, “If you ask me (meaning if you want my opinion), Melissa was always too good for him.”  Wh en you say someone “is too good for” someone else, you mean that they are bett er than someone, that that other person was not as good as they are and that t he other person did not deserve to be with this person that you think is to o good for the other one.  So, if Melissa is too good for Eric, that means that Eric is not as good a person as Melissa, and Melissa should try to find someone els e.

Cameron says, “Really?  I don’t know Eric too well,  but he seemed nice.”  Phil says, “Yeah, he’s nice on the surface, but he’s rea lly a slimeball.”  “On the surface” means related to how you seem at first, be fore you really understand the other person; another word we might use is “superfi cially.”  It means that it appears that a person is one way, but once you get to know them better you realize that they aren’t that friendly, or they are n’t that nice, or they aren’t that smart, and so forth.  Phil says that Eric is nice o n the surface, but he’s really – he’s truly, actually – a slimeball.  A “slimeball” (slimeball) is an informal word describing someone who you don’t want to spend a lo t of time with because you don’t respect him; you don’t think that he’s a good  person.  He does bad things; he does tricky things; he does things in secret, pe rhaps, that are not very nice, or he’s not honest with the other person.  It’s a very  negative way to describe someone, usually a man, often used to talk about a man who is not nice to his romantic partners.

Phil says, “Trust me, I know.”  Cameron says, “I be lieve you, but what’s Melissa going to do now?”  Phil says, “I think she should f ind a nice guy who’ll appreciate her.”  Phil thinks that Melissa should get a new ro mantic partner, someone who is a nice guy who will appreciate her.  “To appreciate ” is the opposite of “to take for granted.  “To appreciate (someone)” is to recognize  their good qualities, to value them, to let them know that you are happy, to thank  them.

Cameron asks Phil, “Someone like you?” meaning shou ld Melissa be your romantic partner.  Phil says, “She could do worse.”   This is an interesting expression.  When you say someone “could do worse,”  you’re talking about something that isn’t perfect, but it’s not bad, and  it’s better than most other similar things.  In this case, Phil is saying that he’s not  perfect – he’s not the perfect person, but he’s a pretty good person, a good choic e for Melissa.  It’s often used to talk about romantic relationships; when you say that someone could do worse you mean that the person they are with isn’t perfec t, but there are a lot of other people who are worse.  Phil says, “I’d treat her ri ght and make her happy.”  I

would treat Melissa right, meaning I would be kind,  I would be appreciative, thoughtful, nice, considerate of this person; I wou ld not do bad things to them.

Cameron says, “You sound like a man with a plan.”  “A man with a plan” is someone who knows what he wants to do, who already has thought of things to do in order to accomplish what he wants to.  Phil s ays, “‘Be prepared.’  Isn’t that what the Boy Scouts say?”  “The Boy Scouts” is an o rganization that teaches young boys practical skills, values, and so forth.  I was a Boy Scout, I think, when I was a young boy.  The saying – the motto of the B oy Scouts – the expression that they use is “Be prepared,” meaning always be r eady.  In order to be prepared, of course, you have to work hard, you hav e to practice, you have to train, and those are some of the values that the Bo y Scouts are supposed to teach the young boys.  There’s also, of course, the  Girl Scouts, which is a similar organization for young girls.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Phil:  Did you hear that Melissa has finally left E ric?  It’s about time!

Cameron:  Oh, that’s sad.  It’s always sad when two  people can’t make it work.

Phil:  Well, it wasn’t for a lack of trying, on Mel issa’s part.  She bent over backwards trying to please Eric and he always took her for granted.  If you ask me, Melissa was always too good for him.

Cameron:  Really?  I don’t know Eric too well, but he seemed nice.

Phil:  Yeah, he’s nice on the surface, but he’s rea lly a slimeball.  Trust me, I know.

Cameron:  I believe you, but what’s Melissa going to do now?

Phil:  I think she should find a nice guy who’ll ap preciate her.

Cameron:  Someone like you?

Phil:  She could do worse.  I’d treat her right and  make her happy.

Cameron:  You sound like a man with a plan.

Phil:  “Be prepared.”  Isn’t that what the Boy Scou ts say?

# Doubting One¡¦s Language Use

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 710: Doubting One’s Language Use.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 710.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Support this podcast by  becoming an ESL Podcast member.  In addition to feeling good about yourself  for supporting this podcast, you can also download a Learning Guide for each of our current episodes that will help you improve your English faster than ever .

This episode is about doubting one’s language use, especially when you’re speaking another language, which, of course, most of you are.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Flora:  Can you help me?  I’m working on this email  to Emil and I’m having trouble coming up with the right words in French.

Andy:  My French isn’t much better than yours, but I’ll give it a shot.

Flora:  Okay, read this sentence for me.  What I wa nt to know is if that is a suitable way to say that I’m sick, but that I’m not  seriously ill.

Andy:  Word choice can be tricky, but I think that’ s the appropriate word, with the right meaning and the right connotations.

Flora:  Okay, now read this sentence.  It doesn’t s ound right to me.  Is this the right usage of the word “ faire ”?  I really doubt it.

Andy:  That’s because you’re using the wrong form of the verb, I think.  Now if only I can think of the correct form.  My French is  really, really rusty.

Flora:  Now that you’ve pointed out the problem, I can look it up later.  What about this paragraph?  The last sentence sounds awk ward to me.

Andy:  It sounds okay to me, but then again, I’m no t a native speaker.

Flora:  Ugh, this is so frustrating!  It’s such a p roduction every time I write him an email.

Andy:  Maybe Emil will learn English and your troub les will be over.

Flora:  Yes and maybe monkeys will fly out of my bu tt!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Flora saying to Andy, “Can  you help me?  I’m working on this email to Emil and I’m having trouble coming  up with the right words in French.”  “To come up with (something)” is a phrasa l verb meaning to think of something, to have an idea for something or an idea  about something: “I have to come up with a title for this episode.”  I have to invent one; I have to think of one; I have to create one.  Flora is having difficulty c oming up with or thinking of the right or correct words in French for an email she’s  writing in French.

Andy says, “My French isn’t much better than yours, ” meaning my knowledge of French, or my French fluency or proficiency isn’t m uch better than yours.  He says, “I’ll give it a shot.”  “To give (something) a shot” (shot) means you’ll try something even when you don’t think you will be suc cessful, usually because it’s very difficult.  “I’m not very good at fixing cars,  but I’ll give it a shot.”  I’ll try; I don’t expect I will be successful.  Andy is going to give  it a shot, going to give helping Flora in her French email a shot.

Flora says, “Okay, read this sentence for me.  What  I want to know is if that is a suitable way to say that I’m sick, but that I’m not  seriously ill.”  A “suitable” (suitable) way is an appropriate way, an acceptable  way, something that is okay to do in a particular situation.  Flora wants to kn ow if she’s using the right word to say that she’s sick, but not seriously sick.

Andy says, “Word choice can be tricky.”  “Word choi ce” is picking the right word to say exactly what you want to say.  “Tricky” (tri cky) here means difficult or challenging, something that is easy to make a mista ke at.  So, it can be difficult to pick the right word.  Andy says, “Word choice can b e tricky, but I think that’s the appropriate word, with the right meaning and the ri ght connotations.” “Appropriate” here means the same as suitable; it’s  something that is acceptable; it is right for this situation.  Andy thinks she ha s the right word; it has the right “meaning” – the right definition, if you will, and the right connotations.  A “connotation” (connotation) is an additional meanin g to a word or a phrase; it is the ideas that you think of when you hear that word  and phrase even if it isn’t the actual definition that you would find in a dictiona ry.  We have something called

the “denotation,” that’s the definition that you wi ll see in a dictionary.  The “connotation” are all the other meanings that are a ssociated with that word or things that you think of when you hear that word.  For example, the word “stubborn” means the same as “strong-willed.”  It’s  someone who doesn’t change their mind, someone who will do what they want to d o even if other people disagree with them.  However, the connotations of s tubborn are negative.  If you say someone is stubborn, that’s a criticism.  If yo u say someone is strong-willed, that is a compliment usually; it means that they are a strong person, a good thing.  So the connotations are different, even tho ugh the denotations are similar.

Andy thinks this word that Flora chose is the right  word.  I’m not sure what word it is.  Je ne sais pas , as we say in French.  That means, I think, I don’ t know.  I’m not sure, I don’t know!  Anyway, Flora then says, “ Okay, now read this sentence. It doesn’t sound right to me.”  When we say somethi ng doesn’t “sound right” we mean that it might be grammatically correct but it isn’t the exact meaning you want or it isn’t what people would normally say in this situation.  Flora says, “Is this the right usage of the word ‘ faire ’?  I really doubt it.”  “Usage” (usage) is the way that a word or phrase is used.  The correct gra mmatical way that you use a word as well as the correct meaning, that’s usage.  Flora is asking about how the verb “ faire ” in French is used.  Flora says that she doubts th at she is using it correctly.  “To doubt” means that you are not sure about something.

Andy says, “That’s because you’re using the wrong f orm of the verb, I think.” “Form” here refers to the correct conjugation of the verb; is it for “I” or “you” or “they,” that sort of thing.  “Form” has many meanin gs in English, of course. Some of those can be found in our Learning Guide for this episode.  Andy says, “Now if only I can think of the correct form.”  He means he doesn’t know what it is, but he’s trying to think of it right now: “If o nly I can think of the correct form.” He says, “My French is really, really rusty (rusty) .”  “Rusty” is a way of saying that it isn’t as strong as it used to be; I haven’t prac ticed it; I haven’t used it.  You can say this about anything; you could say, “Oh, I used  to be a very good tennis player, but now I’m little rusty.”  “Rust” (rust) i s what happens when you have metal changing because of water and air and other t hings that change the outside of the metal; often it becomes a reddish co lor.  But in the sentence, “rusty,” as an adjective, is used to mean something  that you used to do well but don’t do very well anymore.

Flora says, “Now that you’ve pointed out the proble m (now that you’ve told me what’s wrong), I can look it up later.”  “To look ( something) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to search for it.  We used to search for it in books, dictionaries, grammar books.  Nowadays, people sear ch for it on the Internet, they Google it.  That’s how we look things up nowad ays, how we research, how

we investigate something to find an answer.  Flora says, “What about this paragraph?  The last sentence sounds awkward to me. ”  The verb “to sound” here is normally for something to make a noise, lik e “the bell sounds” or “the alarm sounds.”  But here, it means seems: “The last  sentence seems to me to be awkward.”  It appears to me; that’s the way I’m rea ding it; that’s my interpretation; it seems to me the last sentence sounds awkward.  “ Awkward” (awkward) means that it isn’t quite right.  It’s often used to desc ribe something that’s difficult to do, or someone who is in a tough position or an uncomfo rtable position.  Here, when we say it sounds awkward, we mean it doesn’t sound correct.

Andy says, “It sounds okay to me, but then again, I ’m not a native speaker.” “Then again” means on the other hand: “However, I’m  not a native speaker.”  A “native speaker” is someone who grew up, usually fr om the time they were a small baby, hearing and speaking the language.

Flora says, “Ugh, this is so frustrating!  It’s suc h a production every time I write him an email.”  “Production” here means something t hat requires a lot of work. Andy says, “Maybe Emil will learn English and your troubles will be over.”  When we say someone’s troubles will be over, we mean tha t sometime in the future, we’re not sure when, they will no longer have this problem.  Flora says, “Yes and maybe monkeys will fly out of my butt!”  Well, your  “butt,” you probably know, (butt) is what you sit on.  This is a very informal  phrase that comes from a movie in the 1990s called Wayne’s World  in English.  It was a movie with Mike Myers. Anyway, in the movie they’re talking about somethin g that seems very impossible, something that would be almost impossib le to happen.  For example, you might say, “Well, maybe you will become Preside nt of the United States,” which doesn’t seem very likely, and you can reply, “Well, yeah.  Maybe monkeys will fly out of my butt!”  Of course, monkeys don’t  fly, and they certainly don’t fly out of your butt!  It’s a funny phrase.  The old ph rase was “when pigs fly.”  “When pigs fly” is meant to indicate an impossible condit ion.  Pigs, of course, don’t fly, and so it will never happen.  So, it’s another way of saying that will never happen. Do not use this with your boss!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Flora:  Can you help me?  I’m working on this email  to Emil and I’m having trouble coming up with the right words in French.

Andy:  My French isn’t much better than yours, but I’ll give it a shot.

Flora:  Okay, read this sentence for me.  What I wa nt to know is if that is a suitable way to say that I’m sick, but that I’m not  seriously ill.

# A Difficult Place to Find

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 711: A Difficult Place to Find.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 711.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Download this episode’s  Learning Guide, an 8- to 10-page guide to our episode, to improve your Engli sh even faster.

This episode is a dialogue between Ricardo and Mars ha about a place that is difficult to find.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ricardo:  I’m making one more pass and if we don’t see a sign for the hotel, I’m heading back into town.  I’m tired and I want a sho wer.

Marsha:  I’m sure we’ll find it.  When I talked to the desk clerk, she said that the hotel is hidden away behind some trees and to keep an eye out for their white sign.

Ricardo:  Did she say blink and you’ll miss it?  Be cause we’ve driven past this stretch three times and I don’t see a sign.

Marsha:  She just said that they’re a little off the beaten path.

Ricardo:  If they know that their hotel is so hard to find, why don’t they make it more prominent with some kind of landmark?

Marsha:  That’s part of the charm of a small hotel hideaway.  It doesn’t have neon signs and it’s tucked away far from the touris t areas.

Ricardo:  That’s all good and fine, but we have to find it first.  Okay, this is the last pass.  Keep your eyes peeled.

Marsha:  There it is!  I’ve spotted the sign.  It’s  over there, see?

Ricardo:  Yeah, now I see it.  Geez, it’s like find ing a needle in a haystack!

[end of dialogue]

Ricardo begins by saying, “I’m making one more pass .”  “To make one more pass” means to try to do something one more time, e specially in this case where Ricardo is driving and he’s trying to find a specif ic place and perhaps he’s driven down this road once or more than once, he’s going t o try it one more time.  He says, “if we don’t see a sign for the hotel, I’m he ading back into town.”  “To head back” is a phrasal verb meaning to begin to go back  to the place from which you came, to return to where you were before.  In this case, Ricardo is going to head back to into town.  Here, the word “town” means any  urban area; could be a city, it could be a small town.  The general expression “ to go into town” usually means to go to the busier part of a city or into a city.

Ricardo says, “I’m tired and I want a shower.”  Mar sha says, “I’m sure we’ll find it. When I talked to the desk clerk, she said that the hotel is hidden away behind some trees.”  The “desk clerk” is the person who an swers the phone for a business or an office; we might also call the desk clerk a “receptionist.”  Marsha says that the desk clerk told her that the hotel is  hidden away.  “To be hidden (hidden) away” means that you cannot easily see som ething, usually because it is behind something else.  In this case, the hotel is behind some trees so you can’t see it from the street – from the road.  The desk clerk also told Marsha to keep an eye out for the white sign that the hotel h as.  The expression “to keep an eye out” is very common; it means to look for somet hing, to be aware of the things around you.  You might say to your husband, “When you go to the grocery store, keep an eye out for any sales,” anything tha t is being sold at a discounted or lower price.  To keep an eye out, then, means to  be looking for something.

Ricardo says, “Did she say blink and you’ll miss it ?”  Ricardo is trying to be funny here.  This is an old expression, “blink and you’ll  (or you will) miss it.”  “To blink” means to open and close your eyelids; you do this a utomatically.  The idea is that it happens very quickly.  So when someone says, “bl ink and you’ll miss it,” they mean that if you’re not looking carefully you will go right by it; you will miss it; you will not see it perhaps because it is well hidden, or perhaps because it is very small, or perhaps it relates to an event that will happen quickly.  Ricardo is saying that it must be a place that is very difficult to f ind.  He says, “Because we’ve driven past this stretch three times and I don’t se e a sign.”  “Stretch” here refers to a certain part or a certain section of a road, b etween one point and another.  It could be three blocks, it could be a half a mile, it could be five kilometers; it’s a somewhat vague, unspecific term to refer to a part of a street or a road.  In this case, Ricardo is referring to the part of the road where the hotel is supposed to be, and they still are unable to find it.

Marsha says, “She just said that they’re a little o ff the beaten path.”  “A little” here means slightly, a little bit.  “To be off the beate n path” means to be in a place that is not normally visited by a lot of people; it’s no t downtown, it’s not where there are a lot of tourists.

Ricardo says, “If they know that their hotel is so hard to find, why don’t they make it more prominent with some kind of landmark?”  “Pr ominent” here means to be seen easily because it’s very large or perhaps diff erent.  Some buildings have special signs or things that they put on the buildi ng so you can find them easily when you’re driving down the street.  McDonald’s, t he hamburger restaurant, has a big yellow “m” that makes the restaurant more pro minent; you see that; you know what that means; you can find it easily becaus e of it.  Ricardo says that they should make their hotel more prominent with so me kind of “landmark.”  Here he’s using the term, I think, to mean some physical  change in the building, some thing that they would add to the building, perhaps a big flagpole with a flag or something that they could tell people to look for t hat would indicate that their hotel was there.  We also use the term “landmark” t o refer to important buildings or statues, but here it’s used more generally to me an simply something physical that will help you find the location.

Marsha says, “That’s part of the charm of a small h otel hideaway.”  “Charm” here means things that are likable, especially in a some what and perhaps old- fashioned way, the way things used to be many years  ago.  When someone says, “Oh, this is charming,” they mean it’s nice, it’s pleasant, it’s calming perhaps.  “Charm” is also used to describe a person ality characteristic.  When you say, “That man was very charming,” we mean he w as very nice; he was very likable.  Marsha says that this is one of the charm s of a small hotel hideaway. “Hideaway” (hideaway – one word) is a place where y ou can go that you will not be interrupted by other people, a place where you can be by yourself so that no one will bother you or find you.  Marsha says, “It doesn’t have neon signs and it’s tucked away far from the tourist areas.”  A “neon ( neon) sign” is a large sign where the words and images are in special lights.  You put a special kind of gas – neon gas into these tubes that act like light bul bs and form the sign.  Neon signs were very popular back in the 50s and 60s and  70s, and still today in some places.  Las Vegas is famous for its neon signs, so  is Sunset Boulevard here in Los Angeles, and, of course, Broadway in New York C ity.  Anyway, Marsha says that this hotel does not have neon signs, “it’s tuc ked away far from the tourist areas.”  “To be tucked away” means to be far away f rom other people, other buildings, from where the rest of the people are; i n this case, away from the tourist areas, places where visitors would go.

Ricardo says, “That’s all good and fine (meaning we ll, that’s nice), but we have to find it first.  Okay,” he says, “this is the last p ass,” the last time he’s going to drive down this stretch of road.  “Keep your eyes peeled, ” he says.  “To keep your eyes peeled” (peeled) means to look for something v ery carefully, especially when you know it is difficult to find.  So, it’s si milar to “keep an eye out,” but it requires even more concentration; you have to reall y be looking for it because you know it’s difficult to find.

Marsha says, “There it is!  I’ve spotted (or seen) the sign.  It’s over there, see?” Ricardo says, “Yeah, now I see it.  Geez, it’s like  finding a needle in a haystack!” “Geez,” spelled usually (geez), is an expression of  surprise or relief or some sort of uncertainty.  In this case, it’s more relief tha n anything else.  Someone says, “Oh, geez!  Where did I put my keys?” you’re confus ed; you’re lost.  Or someone may say, “Oh, geez!  You scared me when you walked up without knocking on my door.”  So, it can be used in a lot of different  cases.  Ricardo says finding this hotel is like finding a needle in a haystack.  A “n eedle” is a small, sharp pin that is used for sewing things together, putting together t wo pieces of fabric for clothing, for example.  A “haystack” is made of hay – “hay” i s basically dried grass – that is put together and used on a farm.  The idea of a nee dle in a haystack is that it’s very difficult to find.  It would be very difficult  to find any sort of small object that was hidden in a large area, that’s the idea of find ing a needle in a haystack.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ricardo:  I’m making one more pass and if we don’t see a sign for the hotel, I’m heading back into town.  I’m tired and I want a sho wer.

Marsha:  I’m sure we’ll find it.  When I talked to the desk clerk, she said that the hotel is hidden away behind some trees and to keep an eye out for their white sign.

Ricardo:  Did she say blink and you’ll miss it?  Be cause we’ve driven past this stretch three times and I don’t see a sign.

Marsha:  She just said that they’re a little off the beaten path.

Ricardo:  If they know that their hotel is so hard to find, why don’t they make it more prominent with some kind of landmark?

Marsha:  That’s part of the charm of a small hotel hideaway.  It doesn’t have neon signs and it’s tucked away far from the touris t areas.

Ricardo:  That’s all good and fine, but we have to find it first.  Okay, this is the last pass.  Keep your eyes peeled.

Marsha:  There it is!  I’ve spotted the sign.  It’s  over there, see?

Ricardo:  Yeah, now I see it.  Geez, it’s like find ing a needle in a haystack!

# Types of Business Entities

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 712: Types of Business Entities.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 712.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Support this podcast by  becoming an ESL Podcast member.  When you do, you’ll get our Learning Guide  for each episode that will help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is a dialogue between Ron and Marcela.   It is about the kinds of business organizations – the legal ways of organizi ng your business in the United States, what we call “business entities.”  Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Ron:  I’m only your tax accountant, but let me give  you a piece of advice.  If you’re planning to start a business, you’ll want to  carefully consider what type of business entity you want to do business under.

Marcela:  Is that important?  My parents ran a mom- and-pop store for 40 years and they never had to think about stuff like that.

Ron:  I don’t know about your parents’ business, bu t opening a store these days means having to think about the tax implications an d liability issues.

Marcela:  Liability issues?

Ron:  Yes.  What if somebody sues you?  Without pro per safeguards, a lawsuit could bankrupt you and your business.

Marcela:  I’d never thought of that.

Ron:  You’ll probably want to consider forming a co rporation or an LLC.  You’ll be a sole proprietor, right?  You’re not going into bu siness with someone else, are you?

Marcela:  I’ll have two partners actually.

Ron:  In that case, you’ll also want to think about  things like the transferring of interests and the duration of the entity.

Marcela:  Wow, starting a business is a lot more co mplicated than I thought.

Ron:  My advice?  Get a lawyer, and the sooner the better!

[end of dialogue]

Ron begins by saying to Marcela, “I’m only your tax  accountant, but let me give you a piece of advice.”  An “accountant” is someone  takes care of your financial records, who makes sure that you are keeping track of what you spend and what you make.  Usually accountants prepare tax returns – tax forms for the government for your business.  He, Ron, is a “tax a ccountant.”  It’s a person who specializes in looking at the tax situation for a b usiness.  He’s going to give Marcela a piece of advice.  A “piece of advice” is really the same as a sentence or one statement of advice – one idea.  He says, “I f you’re planning to start a business (if you plan to start a business), you’ll want to carefully consider what type of business entity you want to do business und er.”  “Business entity” is the way the business is structured legally, the way tha t it is recognized legally, usually requiring some sort of registration with the government but not always.

Marcela says, “Is that important?  My parents ran a  mom-and-pop store for 40 years and they never had to think about stuff like that.”  “Mom and pop” stands for mother and father.  “Pop” is an informal way of  referring to your father – your dad.  “Mom-and-pop” businesses are owned by a marri ed couple – a husband and a wife.  Often, the term is used to describe fa mily-owned businesses, businesses that perhaps the parents own and the chi ldren work in, for example. Marcela says that her parents had a mom-and-pop sto re and they never thought about business entities.

Ron says, “I don’t know about your parents’ busines s, but opening a store these days (meaning nowadays; today) means having to thin k about the tax implications and liability issues.”  The way you or ganize your business has two important consequences.  One is tax implications.  “Implication” is really another name for consequences, what will happen as a result  of what you do.  “Tax” refers to the money you have to pay the government for the money that you make – the profits that you make.  “Liability” has to do with whether something goes wrong, and if it does who’s going to pay for it.  If a customer is in your store and they fall and hurt themselves, you, as the owne r of the store, might be liable; you might have to pay for their injury.  They may s ue you, they may go to court –

to the legal system and try to get money from you.  All of these things are related to the general concept of liability, who’s responsi ble.

Marcela says, “Liability issues?”  Ron says, “Yes.  What if,” or imagine – “What if somebody sues you?”  “To sue” (sue), as I mentioned , is to take someone to court, to the legal system and demand that they giv e you money because they did something wrong to you.  The word “sue” has oth er meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ex planations.  Ron says, “Without proper safeguards, a lawsuit could bankrup t you and your business.”  A “safeguard” (safeguard – one word) is something tha t you do to protect yourself in case something bad happens.  We might also call it a “precaution.”  For example, I buy trip insurance – I buy travel insura nce before I go on a long vacation.  In case there’s problem with the plane o r something goes wrong, the insurance will pay me for the money I have lost.  T hat is an example of a safeguard.  Ron says, “Without proper (or correct) safeguards, a lawsuit could bankrupt you.”  A “lawsuit” (lawsuit – one word) is  the legal process of suing you, of taking you to court, to the legal system and dem anding money.  That whole process is called a lawsuit.  “To bankrupt (someone )” means to have the business or the person go to the government and say , “I don’t have any more money,” and this gives you a certain protection aga inst people who are asking or demanding money from you.  However, normally the te rm “bankrupt,” in the context that we’re hearing it here, refers to a fai lure of your business, that your business will lose money and that you will lose you r business in effect.  It has a legal term – a legal definition, rather, but more g enerally to bankrupt something or someone means that they are financially ruined.  It’s a disaster for them; they may lose their business, and so forth.

Marcela said, “I’d never thought of that.”  Ron say s, “You’ll probably want to consider forming a corporation or an LLC.”  So, the re are different types of business entities that are popular or common in the  United States.  One of the most common is a corporation.  A “corporation” is a  company that is legally separated from its owners in a way that protects the owners in case there’s a problem in the business.  Technically, the corporat ion is like another person legally, and typically in a corporation you have pe ople who own parts of the corporation, what we call “shareholders,” they own a part of the corporation. Sometimes the corporation is public and you can buy  a part of the company; anyone can buy a part of the company.  Big companie s like Google and Apple and Microsoft are what we call “public” corporation s; anyone can be part owner by buying what are called “shares,” or stock in the  company.  If the company – the corporation gets sued, the personal wealth of t he people who are part owners are not at risk.  That is, let’s say you have a com pany that has 100,000 dollars, and each of the shareholders has 200,000 dollars in  their bank account.  Well, if

you sue the corporation, the corporation only has t o pay from the 100,000 dollars.  It doesn’t affect the individual sharehol ders – the individual owners; their 200,000 dollars in the bank is not something that y ou can get from the company. So, the corporation separates the financial interes ts – the financial matters of the business from the financial matters of the individu al person.

A kind of corporation is called “limited liability corporation,” that’s what an “LLC” is.  Normally, we use the abbreviation “LLC.”  An L LC is a kind of business that is like a corporation, but it’s also alike another kin d of business entity, a partnership. A “partnership” is when two people or a small group  of people get together and decide that each person will own part of the busine ss, but a partnership doesn’t have the same legal protections as a corporation do es.  So, the LLC is sort of a combination of a corporation and a partnership.

Ron says, “You’ll be a sole proprietor, right?”  A “sole proprietor” is someone who owns the business, but doesn’t have any separate le gal organization for the business, so that if there’s a problem both his or her personal finances as well as the business finances can be at risk; you could sue  them.  There’s no protection for what we would call your personal “assets,” the money and other valuable things that you own personally.  So, proprietorship s do not have the same protections as corporations and LLCs.

Ron says, “You’re not going into business with some one else, are you?”  “To go into business with” means to open a business with s omeone else.  Marcela says, “I’ll have two partners actually.”  Once again, a “ partner” is someone who agrees to work with you on the business and own the busine ss with you.  Ron says, “In that case (in that situation), you’ll also want to think about things like the transferring of interests and the duration of the e ntity.”  “To transfer interests” is to give or sell your ownership in something to anot her person.  So let’s say you have two partners, and they start a business togeth er, and then one says, “Eh, I don’t really like this business; I want to leave.”  You need to have some process – some agreement about how that person can sell the ir interests in the company. Their “interests” are the things that they have inv ested, the money that they have in the company.  “Duration” has to do with how long  something lasts.  So the duration of a partnership would be determined by the agreement; you might decide we’re going to be partners for five years an d then we’ll decide what to do then.

Marcela says, “Wow, starting a business is a lot mo re complicated than I thought.”  Ron says, “My advice?  Get a lawyer, and  the sooner the better!”  A “lawyer” is another word for an attorney, someone w ho has legal expertise – someone who’s a legal expert.  He says, “Get a lawy er, and the sooner the

better!” meaning the faster that you get the lawyer  the better it will be for you; don’t wait, get one as soon as possible.

So that’s a little bit about business entities in t he United States.  Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal rate of speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ron:  I’m only your tax accountant, but let me give  you a piece of advice.  If you’re planning to start a business, you’ll want to  carefully consider what type of business entity you want to do business under.

Marcela:  Is that important?  My parents ran a mom- and-pop store for 40 years and they never had to think about stuff like that.

Ron:  I don’t know about your parents’ business, bu t opening a store these days means having to think about the tax implications an d liability issues.

Marcela:  Liability issues?

Ron:  Yes.  What if somebody sues you?  Without pro per safeguards, a lawsuit could bankrupt you and your business.

Marcela:  I’d never thought of that.

Ron:  You’ll probably want to consider forming a co rporation or an LLC.  You’ll be a sole proprietor, right?  You’re not going into bu siness with someone else, are you?

Marcela:  I’ll have two partners actually.

Ron:  In that case, you’ll also want to think about  things like the transferring of interests and the duration of the entity.

Marcela:  Wow, starting a business is a lot more co mplicated than I thought.

Ron:  My advice?  Get a lawyer, and the sooner the better!

# Being Physically Strong

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 713: Being Physically Strong.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 713.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, and make your life a little easier by gett ing the transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Being Physically Strong.”  It’s a dialogue between Takeshi and Paula.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Takeshi:  What do you want me to do with this piano ?

Paula:  I want you to move it from the living room to the family room.  You’re as strong as an ox and that’s why I called you for hel p.

Takeshi:  Lucky me.  I don’t think I can move that piano by myself, though.

Paula:  You’re built and have muscles coming out of  your ears.  Come on!  Let’s put those muscles to work!

Takeshi:  I haven’t been working out as much recent ly.  I don’t think I’m up to the job.

Paula:  I’ll cut you some slack.  I’ll help.

Takeshi:  What I’m trying to tell you is that you’l l need at least three big guys to move this piano.  There’s no way around it.

Paula:  Come on.  Be a man.  Suck it up!  I’m willi ng to put my back into it, so let’s move this thing.

Takeshi:  You are completely deluded if you think we’re going to move this piano one inch.  I, for one, am not putting my back out t rying to do the work of three!

[end of dialogue]

Takeshi begins by saying to Paula, “What do you wan t me to do with this piano?” A “piano,” you probably know, is a musical instrume nt that has white and black we call “keys” that you play on.  Paula says, “I wa nt you to move it from the living room to the family room.”  Some big houses have two  spaces where many people can sit down and talk or watch television.  The family room is separate from the living room.  I’m not sure exactly the dif ference, since my house is too small to have a family room and a living room, but basically it’s another living room.  It’s a place where you have a sofa and perha ps some chairs.  People often put their televisions, or in this case their piano in the living room or family room.

Paula says, “You’re as strong as an ox and that’s w hy I called you for help.” Takeshi is as strong as an ox.  An “ox” is usually a male cow, what we call a “bull,” that has had some of its male sexual organs  removed – the word is “castration” – and the animal is then trained to pu ll heavy things, to be a strong farm animal.  So we have this expression “strong as  an ox” to describe a very strong person – physically strong person, someone w ith a lot of muscles.  Not like me!

Takeshi says, “Lucky me.”  Now, there he’s being sa rcastic; he doesn’t really mean he’s lucky.  He’s saying that he’s not that happy that he has to come over and move this piano, that’s the idea.  He says, “I don’t think I can move that piano by myself, though.”  “Though” means however.

Paula says, “You’re built and have muscles coming o ut of your ears.”  To say that someone is “built” (built) in this context means th ey have very strong muscles, you can see them on their body.  “Built” has a numb er of meanings in English, however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some  additional ones.  Paula says that Takeshi has muscles coming out of his ear s, which is kind of a strange expression.  To have something “coming out of your ears” means to have a lot of something, to have more than what you actually need .  Paula says, “Come on! Let’s put those muscles to work!”  Let’s start usin g those muscles.

Takeshi says, “I haven’t been working out much rece ntly.  I don’t think I’m up to the job.”  “To work out” is a two-word phrasal verb  that here means to exercise, to do physical exercise.  Someone says, “I’m going to go work out at the gym.” I’m going to go do exercises at the gym; maybe run or lift weights, that sort of thing.  Takeshi says that he’s not up to the job.  The expression “to be up to the job” means to be prepared and ready to do something , to feel that you are able to

do it.  You might say about someone, “Well, she’s r eally not up to the job,” meaning she isn’t prepared to do this, whatever it is.

Paula says, “I’ll cut you some slack.  I’ll help.”  “To cut (someone) some slack” (slack) is an expression meaning I will make the si tuation easier for someone else, in this case so they don’t have to work as ha rd.  “To cut (someone) some slack” can also mean not to require them to do as m uch as you want, to go easy on them, not to blame them, to give them some extra  time for example, or whatever they need to finish a difficult job.

Takeshi says, “What I’m trying to tell you is that you’ll need at least three big guys (big men) to move the piano.  There’s no way a round it.”  The expression “there’s no way around it” means that you cannot ch ange something; this is the way it really is; it’s unavoidable; you have to do it this way or this has to be done. In this case, Paula needs to get three strong men, not just one.

Paula says, “Come on.  Be a man.  Suck it up!”  The se are all informal expressions.  “Come on” means let’s go; let’s get s tarted.  It can sometimes be used to indicate that the other person is resisting  what you are suggesting, doesn’t want to do what you are suggesting, and you  are encouraging them – you are urging them to do what you want to do.  Pau la says, “Come on.  Be a man.”  “Be a man” is a phrase used to tell a man th at he needs to be braver or stronger, and stop crying or complaining.  “Suck it  up!” is a phrase used to tell someone that he or she needs to stop complaining an d do what is necessary, even if it is difficult.  So, you may say, “Oh, it’ s too hot.  I can’t cut the grass today (the lawn today),” and your wife says, “Oh, just su ck it up!”  You need to go and do it; stop complaining.  Paula says, “I’m willing to put my back into it, so let’s move this thing.”  “To put your back into (somethin g)” means to work very hard, especially at something that requires a lot of phys ical strength.

Takeshi says, “You are completely deluded if you th ink we’re going to move this piano one inch.”  “To be deluded” (deluded) means t o be confused, to believe something that is not true, or to be fooled.  You’r e really saying they have some sort of psychological problem; they think something  that isn’t true.  The noun would be “delusions.”  Takeshi says to Paula, “You are completely deluded if you think we’re going to move this piano one inch (mean ing even a very small amount).  I, for one, am not putting my back out tr ying to do the work of three (or of three men)!”  “I, for one” is a phrase that we u se to emphasize your opinion about something, your position about something.  It ’s not as commonly used nowadays, but you will still hear it.  “I, for one,  am not going to go to the beach today, because it’s raining.”  You can go, but I am  not.  It is often said when someone else wants to do something, or other people  are doing something but

you are not going to do it.  So you’re expressing s omewhat more strongly, with emphasis, that you are not going to do this thing.

“I, for one,” Takeshi says, “am not putting my back  out trying to do the work of three (men).”  “To put your back out” means to inju re or to hurt the back.  The back part of your body, usually between your should ers and your waist or your buttocks, that’s your back.  “To put your back out”  means to hurt it, to injure it, which, of course, can be very painful.  Takeshi doe sn’t want to put his back out trying to do the work of three, in this case of thr ee men.  “To do the work of (a certain number of people)” means to do the same amo unt of work that is normally performed by three men or by whatever numb er you decide to use here. So Takeshi says no, he’s not going to help Paula mo ve – or try to move this piano.  Paula will just have to go and pay someone,  rather than asking her friend Takeshi to come over and do it probably for free, a lthough we’re not sure here.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Takeshi:  What do you want me to do with this piano ?

Paula:  I want you to move it from the living room to the family room.  You’re as strong as an ox and that’s why I called you for hel p.

Takeshi:  Lucky me.  I don’t think I can move that piano by myself, though.

# Dining with a Foodie

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 714: Dining with a Foodie.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 714.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Dining with a Foodie.”  A “ foodie” is someone who likes to go to good restaurants, whose hobby, in a way, is g oing to restaurants and finding good places to eat.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I invited my friend Nick to try a new restaurant wi th me.  This restaurant was the latest thing, and since Nick was a foodie, I though t he would have an interesting take on the meal. …

Anita:  So, what did you think of the first course?

Nick:  I thought it was passable.

Anita:  Just passable?

Nick:  Yes, it was a run-of-the-mill dish you could  find in any fine dining restaurant.  No gourmet would be bowled over by it.

Anita:  Oh, I thought it was pretty good.  What abo ut the main course?

Nick:  I thought the fish wasn’t seasoned properly and it was a touch overcooked.

Anita:  I’m sorry to hear that.

Nick:  And the wine pairing was all wrong.

Anita:  I’m not a wine aficionado, so I guess my pa late isn’t as sophisticated as yours.  I thought the wine was wonderful.

Nick:  Hmm, in my opinion, the entire meal was forg ettable. …

That was the last time I invited Nick to join me for a meal.  I thought the meal was delicious, but Nick’s comments left a bad taste in my mouth!

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with Anita saying that she invited  her friend Nick – Nick is a short form, usually, of Nicholas – to try a new res taurant with her.  “This restaurant,” she says, “was the latest thing.”  “Th e latest thing” is something that everyone is now doing or someplace everyone is now going; it’s considered new, exciting, interesting.  For example we might say no w, in the year 2011, the iPad is the latest thing, or some new computer is the la test thing, or new phone.  “The latest thing” is what is very popular right now, th at everybody wants to get or to try.  The restaurant that Anita wants to go to is a lso the latest thing in her town – in her city, “and since,” she says, “Nick was a foo die,” she thought that Nick would have an interesting take on the meal.  A “foo die” (foodie) is someone who’s very interested in good restaurants, good foo d, someone whose hobby it is, in a way, to find good restaurants and good foo d in a certain city.  Nick would have an interesting take on the meal, Anita thought .  “To have a take on (something)” means to have an opinion, a perspectiv e, an idea about something. Someone might say to you, “What’s your take on the situation in the Middle East?”  What’s your opinion?  What are your ideas a bout it?  “To have an interesting take” would be to have an opinion that other people thought was interesting.  So, Anita thought that Nick, being a foodie, would have an interesting take on the meal – on the food they wer e going to eat at this new restaurant.

Anita says, “So, what do you think of the first cou rse?”  Meals, especially formal meals, come in “courses.”  The first course is what  you eat first; the second course is what you eat second.  Usually, though not  always, they’re brought out from the kitchen one by one: first course, second c ourse, third course, and so forth.  So, Anita asks Nick what he thinks of the f irst course.  Nick says, “I thought it was passable.”  “Passable” means acceptable, oka y, but not excellent, not great.  Anita says, “Just passable?”  Only passable , you didn’t think it was more than just okay?

Nick says, “Yes, it was a run-of-the-mill dish.”  T he expression “run-of-the-mill” (mill) means ordinary, not special, very standard, very typical, maybe a little dull, not very exciting.  Nick says the dish – the first course, the food they ate first – was run-of-the-mill.  “You could find (that kind of  dish) in any fine dining restaurant.”  The term “fine (fine) dining (dining) ” means the experience of eating at a very nice restaurant, often an expensive resta urant, one that is better than what you usually eat at.  “To dine” (dine) is anoth er word for “to eat,” it’s used in somewhat perhaps more formal situations.  So, Nick thinks that this course – this first course could be found at any good restaurant,  any fine dining restaurant. “No gourmet would be bowled over by it,” he says.  A “gourmet” (gourmet) – it comes from French so the last “t” is not pronounced  – is a person who’s very knowledgeable about good food.  It’s kind of like a  “foodie,” but “foodie” is a more modern term – more recent term.  “Gourmet” is a mor e traditional term, and there’s also the idea the person is perhaps better educated in food, knows more about food, and so forth.  We talk about a “gourmet  chef” – a “chef” is a person who cooks food in a restaurant or other location.  So, a “gourmet chef” is a chef that knows a lot about fine dining – about good foo d.  Nick says that a gourmet would not be bowled over by that meal – by that dis h.  The phrase “to be bowled over” means to be very impressed, to be amazed, to be surprised by something. It could be a good surprise; it could be a bad surp rise.  “Bowling” (bowling), as you know, is a game where you take a ball and you t hrow it so that it knocks down what are called “pins” (pins), there’re usuall y 10 of them.  The verb “to bowl” would be to throw the ball – the “bowling bal l” we call it.  “To be bowled over,” however, means to be amazed.  It’s as though  you are so surprised or so shocked that a bowling ball has hit you and you’ve fallen down – something like that.

Anita says, “Oh, I thought it was pretty good (I th ought it was very good).  What about the main course?”  Again, in a formal meal yo u may have a first course, which might be a salad or a soup in an American res taurant; the main course would typically be the meat or the fish, or if it’s  a vegetarian restaurant the tofurkey or the vegetarian hamburger – which is not  a hamburger!  But anyway, we’re talking now about the dialogue, and the main course is what Anita is asking about.  In this case, the main course was fish.  Ni ck says, “I thought the fish wasn’t seasoned properly.”  “To season” (season) is  to put certain spices, salt, pepper onto food.  Nick thinks the fish was not sea soned properly; it didn’t have the right mixture of salt, pepper, other spices.  H e says it was also “a touch overcooked.”  “To be overcooked” means to cook some thing too much; with fish and meat it usually makes the meal hard – it makes the fish or the meat too hard. “A touch” is another way of saying a little bit, ju st a little bit, a small amount. “Touch” has other meanings in English as well; take  a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

 Now, Anita doesn’t agree with Nick.  She says, “I’m  sorry to hear that.”  She’s sorry that Nick doesn’t like his food.  Nick then c omplains a little bit more, because Nick is kind of a jerk!  I mean, you know, Anita invites him to this dinner, and then he sits there and complains the whole time : “Oh, the fish is overcooked.”  Too bad Nick!  But to be fair, Anita did ask Nick to the meal to get his opinion.  Nick continues to offer his opinion; he says, “the wine pairing was all wrong.”  “Pairing” (pairing) is two things that go together; at a meal it would be two things that are paired together, or something t hat is served at the same time. In this case, Nick is complaining about the “wine p airing,” the kind of wine that they chose to go with this particular meal.

Anita says, “I’m not a wine aficionado.”  “Aficiona do” (aficionado) is someone who is very passionate about something; that is, so meone who enjoys something, who has a lot of knowledge about somethi ng.  Anita says she’s not a wine aficionado; she doesn’t know a lot about wine,  “so I guess my palate isn’t as sophisticated as yours.”  Your “palate” is the part  of your mouth that can detect or that can sense taste.  It’s used in a more general way to describe the kinds of tastes that you like and don’t like.  So, Anita say s that her palate – her ability, her knowledge of food – isn’t as sophisticated as Nick’ s.  “To be sophisticated” means to be, in this case, more educated, with more  experience.  The word can also be used to mean something that is elegant, fan cy, rich, something that is cultured; all of these are possible uses of “sophis ticated.”

Anita says, “I thought the wine was wonderful.”  I thought it was good; it was excellent.  Nick says, “Hmm, in my opinion, the mea l was entirely forgettable.” “To forget” means not to remember, so something tha t is described as “forgettable” is something that is not memorable, u sually because it’s not very good.  Anita says this “was the last time I invited  Nick to join me for a meal.  I thought the meal was delicious (it tasted excellent ), but Nick’s comments (Nick’s opinions) left a bad taste in my mouth!”  The expre ssion “to leave a bad taste in your mouth” can refer to food you that are eating, and then later you can still taste the food but it isn’t a good taste.  The expr ession can also be used more generally, as it is here, to mean to leave a bad im pression, to make someone feel unpleasant or uncomfortable later on.  “I had an ar gument with my boss, and his comments left a bad taste in my mouth.”  I’m still thinking about them; they bother me; they still bother me even though the argument i s over.  That’s what Anita is saying here about Nick’s comments.  So be careful i f you are going to invite a foodie to dinner!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

I invited my friend Nick to try a new restaurant wi th me.  This restaurant was the latest thing, and since Nick was a foodie, I though t he would have an interesting take on the meal. …

Anita:  So, what did you think of the first course?

Nick:  Yes, it was a run-of-the-mill dish you could  find in any fine dining restaurant.  No gourmet would be bowled over by it.

Anita:  Oh, I thought it was pretty good.  What abo ut the main course?

Nick:  I thought the fish wasn’t seasoned properly and it was a touch overcooked.

Anita:  I’m sorry to hear that.

Nick:  And the wine pairing was all wrong.

Anita:  I’m not a wine aficionado, so I guess my pa late isn’t as sophisticated as yours.  I thought the wine was wonderful.

Nick:  Hmm, in my opinion, the entire meal was forg ettable. …

That was the last time I invited Nick to join me for a meal.  I thought the meal was delicious, but Nick’s comments left a bad taste in my mouth!

# Outsiders Moving In

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 715: Outsiders Moving In.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 715.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Outsiders (people who live in other places) Moving In (to a new place; a new neighborhood).”  Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Leti:  I am sick and tired of people coming from the big cities into our small town and buying up all of the houses and acting like the y own the place.

George:  This is a dying town and it needs fresh bl ood.  I don’t hear the business owners complaining about the new infusion of money into the town.

Leti:  Oh, yeah?  Well, the flip side is that their  spending is jacking up prices and making it harder for families who have lived here f or generations.

George:  The times are changing and we need to adap t.

Leti:  I say that the newcomers are the ones who ne ed to adapt.  After all, they’re moving to our town.

George:  With that kind of us against them mentalit y, there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers.

Leti:  I look forward to that day.

George:  All I have to say is beware what you wish for!

[end of dialogue]

Leti begins by saying to George, “I am sick and tir ed of people coming from the big cities into our small town.”  The expression “t o be sick and tired” doesn’t

mean you’re actually ill; you’re not really sick an d you may not even be tired.  It’s an expression we use to show that you are angry, th at you are frustrated, especially about something that continues to happen  over a long period of time. “I’m sick and tired of hearing you talk about your dog and how wonderful it is.” I’m tired of it; I don’t want to hear it anymore, y ou’ve been talking about it for many days now.  Leti is sick and tired of people mo ving from big cities into her little, small town.  She says they are “buying up a ll of the houses and acting like they own the place.”  “To buy up” means the same as  “to buy.”  The “up” has a certain sense of emphasis, that it’s happening quic kly perhaps, or that you are buying all that remains of something, not leaving a nything for anyone else.  The “outsiders,” people from outside of the little town , “are buying up all of the houses and acting like they own the place.”  “To act like you own a place” means to feel too comfortable, or perhaps too confident in a plac e where you don’t really belong.  If you visit someone else’s house that you  don’t know very well, and you come into the house and say, “Hey, where’s the refr igerator?  I’m hungry,” well, that’s acting like you own the place.  It’s also co nsidered rather rude to do such a thing.  So, “to act like you own the place” would b e to do things that you don’t really have a right to do.

Leti is angry at these outsiders, but George has a different opinion.  George says, “This is a dying town.”  “To die,” of course,  means to end one’s life; a “dying town” would be a town that is no longer doing very well economically; people are leaving, there aren’t enough jobs, things like that .  George says the town “needs fresh blood.”  “Fresh blood,” here, means new peopl e, people who have not been present before.  He says, “I don’t hear the busines s owners complaining about the new infusion of money into the town.”  The busi ness owners, the people who own the stores and other businesses, are happy.  Th ey’re not complaining about the new infusion of money.  An “infusion” (infusion ) really in this case just means addition, something that is added to it larger or b igger.  In this case, the town is getting richer because new people are coming in and  bringing their money and spending their money in the town.

Leti says, “Oh, yeah?  Well, the flip side is that their spending is jacking up prices.”  The “flip (flip) side” of something is the opposite side of a certain argument or issue.  I could say, “Well, it’s a beau tiful, sunny day,” and you could say, “Well, the flip side is it’s going to be very hot.”  So it’s the aspect or the thing that you’re not thinking about, usually opposite of  what the other person is talking about.  It could be positive; it could be negative.   Back in the old days, when I was a child, they would sell records, and the recor ds would have a song on each side, especially the small what were called “45s.”  So you may have a very popular song on one side, and on the flip side anot her song by the same singer, perhaps a little less popular; we also called it the “B-side.”  In any case, “flip side”

here is used generally to mean the other aspect of something that you haven’t considered.  Leti says the flip side of these new p eople moving in – these outsiders – is that their spending is jacking up pr ices.  “To jack up” is a phrasal verb meaning to increase.  It’s normally used with the word “prices.”  We talk about “jacking up prices,” we’re talking about incr easing prices, things are getting more expensive.  When you have more people wanting to buy the same amount of things or the same things as other people the pr ice will usually go up, because there are people who are willing to pay more money now.  This makes it harder, Leti thinks, for the families who have lived here f or generations.  A “generation” is usually people who are born around the same time; s ome people consider 20 years a generation.  But in any case, the term here  means people who have lived here a long time.  My family has lived in the Unite d States for eight generations, which is about right, a little more than that maybe .  In any case, a long time is what is meant by this expression.  Within a family,  a generation are the people who are all born as brothers and sisters or cousins .  So my parents is one generation, and my brothers and sisters were the ne xt generation, and my nieces and nephews – the sons and daughters of my brothers  and sisters – are a separate generation.  So when I say that we’ve live d here for eight generations, I mean my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-g randfather – actually grandmother came to the United States; that was the  first McQuillan that arrived here, at least from my family.  So that’s what a ge neration is.  Anyway, enough about my family; let’s get back to the story.  Wher e were we?  Oh, yeah.

George says, “The times are changing and we need to  adapt.”  “The times are changing” means the world is changing, things are n ot the same as they were before.  He says we need to accept that, “we need t o adapt.”  “To adapt” (adapt) means to change in response to the changes in your situation or in your environment.  “Adapt” has a couple of different mea nings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Leti says, “I say (meaning my opinion) is that the newcomers are the ones who need to adapt.”  The “newcomers” (newcomers – one w ord) are the people who have just moved into an area; they are new to the a rea.  She says that they are the ones who need to change, to adapt themselves to  the small-town life rather than changing it and making those who have lived th ere for generations adapt. She says, “After all, they’re moving to our town.”

George says, “With that kind of us against them men tality, there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers.”  Let’s start with “us against them mentality.”  “Us against them” is the idea tha t you and your group are opposed to another group, that you have opposite in terests or perhaps competing interests; what’s good for them is not go od for you, and what’s good

for you is not good for them.  That’s “us against t hem” or “us versus them.” “Mentality” is the way of thinking about something;  we might call it your “perspective.”  George says that with kind of think ing – that kind of perspective, “there may be a day when you succeed in driving out  those newcomers,” meaning in the future – some day – you may be succe ssful, you may actually drive out the newcomers.  “To drive out” is a two-w ord phrasal verb that means to do something to make other people leave, especially  a neighborhood or a town, to do things that will make them want to leave.  Th ere are other meanings of the verb “to drive,” and “to drive out,” as well as the  verb “to adapt” that we talked about earlier.  All of that information can be foun d in the Learning Guide for this episode.

George says that Leti and her attitude may drive ou t these newcomers.  Leti says, “I look forward to that day.”  “To look forwa rd to (something)” is to be excited about it, to be waiting for it to happen, t o want it to happen now.  George says, “All I have to say is beware what you wish fo r!”  George is telling Leti that she should “beware” or be careful of what she wishe s for, or wants to happen. It’s a phrase we use to warn someone that if he or she gets what he or she wants there may be some bad things that they haven’t thou ght of, things that you may not expect, so that sometimes we need to be careful  about wanting to change things.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Leti:  I am sick and tired of people coming from the big cities into our small town and buying up all of the houses and acting like the y own the place.

George:  This is a dying town and it needs fresh bl ood.  I don’t hear the business owners complaining about the new infusion of money into the town.

Leti:  Oh, yeah?  Well, the flip side is that their  spending is jacking up prices and making it harder for the families who have lived he re for generations.

George:  The times are changing and we need to adap t.

Leti:  I say that the newcomers are the ones who ne ed to adapt.  After all, they’re moving to our town.

George:  With that kind of us against them mentalit y, there may be a day when you succeed in driving out those newcomers.

 Leti:  I look forward to that day.

George:  All I have to say is beware what you wish for!

# Working Without Supervision

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 716: Working Without Supervision.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 716.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Veronica and Kyl e talked about working without someone watching you – without someone tell ing you what to do.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Veronica:  Where’s Stan?

Kyle:  He’s not here.

Veronica:  When will he be back?

Kyle:  I’m not sure.  He hasn’t been here for a cou ple of days.

Veronica:  A couple of days?!  He’s supposed to be here overseeing the day-to- day operations.  You’re his second-in-command.  Whe re is he?

Kyle:  I honestly don’t know.  He’s been MIA since Tuesday.

Veronica:  I come all the way here to talk to him a bout budget overruns and I find that he’s been shirking his responsibilities, too.  I’ve a feeling he’s been phoning it in for a long time now.  So have you been coveri ng for him?

Kyle:  Me?  I’m just trying to do my job.  When Sta n isn’t here, I do my best to fill in.  But I’m not saying anything against Stan.

Veronica:  I appreciate your loyalty, but when push  comes to shove, you’ve got to look out for yourself, right?

Kyle:  Uh, I guess.  I’m not sure.

 Veronica:  Well, I do.  I need to look out for my b est interests and that’s making sure this place has proper supervision.  How would you like a promotion?

Kyle:  You mean you’re firing Stan and giving me hi s job?

Veronica:  Do you want the job or don’t you?

Kyle:  Can I talk to Stan first?  I don’t want him to think I’m a backstabber.

Veronica:  You can…if you can find him.

[end of dialogue]

Veronica begins by saying, “Where’s Stan?”  Stan is  one of the employees.  Kyle says, “He’s not here.”  Veronica says, “When will h e be back?”  When will he return?  Kyle says, “I’m not sure (I don’t really k now).  He hasn’t been here for a couple of days.”  Maybe two days or three days.

Veronica says, “A couple of days?!  He’s supposed t o be here overseeing the day-to-day operations.”  “To oversee” (oversee – on e word) means to monitor and supervise; to carefully watch how other people are doing their work, making sure that they are doing it correctly.  It’s what a  boss does, or a supervisor.  The “day-to-day operations” are the things that a busin ess does every day, repeatedly, or just the normal, regular things that  a business, an office, or a factory for example does in order to keep their bus iness going.  It doesn’t refer to long-term planning or coming up with a strategy for  the future.  Day-to-day operations are the things that are done on a daily basis or things that are a normal part of what the business does.

Veronica says to Kyle, “You’re his second-in-comman d.”  When we say someone is “second-in-command” we’re using a military phrase to refer to the person who is in charge – who is the leader when the normal le ader isn’t there, the person who is below the leader of a group or organization.   Veronica says to Kyle that he is the second-in-command; but, of course, Stan, who  hasn’t been there for a couple of days, is the leader.  “Where is he?”  Kyl e says, “I honestly don’t know,” meaning I really don’t know.  He’s using that word for emphasis.  “He’s been MIA since Tuesday.”  “MIA” is another military expressi on – there seems to be a lot of military expressions in the business world – meanin g missing in action.  It’s someone who, in a war, has not been found dead, is not a known prisoner, they’re just missing; we don’t know where they are.   They may be alive; they may

be dead.  In the business world, in more general co nversation, to say someone’s “MIA” means that they’re not there, they’re absent,  but we don’t know why.

Veronica says, “I come all the way here to talk to him about budget overruns and I find that he’s been shirking his responsibilities , too.”  So, Veronica went all the way, meaning she probably traveled from another off ice or another part of town, maybe even another city, in order to talk to Stan a bout budget overruns. “Budget” is a word to describe your plan of how you  are going to spend your money – how much money you will make in your busine ss, how much you will spend.  A “budget overrun” is when you spend more t han you planned, when you spend more than you expected to.  Veronica wanted t o talk to Stan about budget overruns, and instead she finds that Stan has been shirking his responsibilities. So not only is Stan spending too much money, he’s s hirking his responsibilities. “To shirk (shirk) your responsibilities” means not to do all the things you are supposed to do, not doing your duty.  “Duty” is ano ther word for responsibilities. So, “to shirk your duties” or “shirk your responsib ilities” is not to do them. Veronica says, “I have a feeling that Stan has been  phoning it in for a long time now.”  The expression “to phone it in” means to do something, especially something for work, but without giving it a lot of effort and attention, treating it as though it doesn’t really matter very much.  You cou ld say this, really, about any kind of job, or the performance of someone on their  job.  They’re doing their job, but they’re not doing it very well; they’re phoning  it in.  The idea is, of course, if you’re phoning something in you’re calling someone,  you’re not actually there doing what you should be doing; you’re doing it fro m a distance by simply picking up the telephone instead of going and doing somethi ng.  I guess that’s where it probably comes, but it means completing a task with  very little effort or attention.

Veronica says, “have you been covering for him (mea ning Stan)?”  “To cover for (someone)” means to do or say something to protect another person, to make sure the other person doesn’t get in trouble; you a re covering for them.  Kyle says, “Me?  I’m just trying to do my job.  When Sta n isn’t here, I do my best to fill in.”  “To fill in” here means to do the work of som eone else or to take someone else’s place in doing the work that they normally d o.  Kyle says, “But I’m not saying anything against Stan,” that is, I’m not cri ticizing Stan.

Veronica replies, “I appreciate (I thank you for) y our loyalty.”  “Loyalty” (loyalty) is supporting another person or another organization, supporting your family, being faithful to them, protecting them.  That’s loyalty.   Veronica says, “when push comes to shove, you’ve got to look out for yourself , right?”  “When push comes to shove” means under extreme circumstances, when ther e is a lot of pressure to do something.  The idea here is that yes, Kyle is l oyal and he’s protecting Stan,

but when the situation becomes more serious or more  critical then he has to look out for himself; he has to protect himself, not Sta n.

Kyle says, “Uh, I guess.  I’m not sure.”  He’s not sure he agrees with Veronica. Veronica says, “Well, I do.  I need to look out for  my best interests and that’s making sure that this place has proper supervision. ”  “To look out for your best interests” means to do what is best for you even if  it’s negative or has negative consequences for someone else.  Well, Veronica is t rying to look out for her own best interests; she’s the boss, so she’s responsibl e for what happens, and she needs to make sure that this office has proper or a ppropriate – correct – supervision.  “Supervision” is overseeing, monitori ng, and being responsible for a group of people.

Veronica says to Kyle, “How would you like a promot ion?”  A “promotion” is when you get an increase in responsibilities, an increas e in your duties at work; usually it means that you get paid more money.  So, you use d to be a salesperson, now you’re the director of sales; you get a promotion, now you are the boss.

Kyle says, “You mean you’re firing Stan and giving me his job?”  “To fire” here means to tell someone they are no longer working th ere, to tell someone they no longer have a job, to get rid of someone.  “Fire” h as a number of different meanings in English however; take a look at the Lea rning Guide for some additional explanations.

Veronica says, “Do you want the job or don’t you?”  He has to give her an answer right now.  Kyle says, “Can I talk to Stan first?  I don’t want him to think I’m a backstabber.”  “To stab (stab) someone in the back”  means to take a knife and put it in their back in order to kill them.  So, a “backstabber” is a person who, literally, stabs someone in the back.  However, we normally don’t mean someone who goes and kills someone else, we mean someone wh o says things about another person – bad things, negative things – with out that person knowing that you are saying it.  Usually you do this in order to  get some sort of benefit for yourself.  So you, for example, tell your boss that  the other person working in your department is lazy and doesn’t do his job.  Yo u, of course, want to get rid of that person so that you, perhaps, can get that pers on’s job.  That would be a backstabber, to do something behind someone’s back,  which is another way of saying without their knowledge – without them knowi ng.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Veronica:  Where’s Stan?

Kyle:  He’s not here.

Veronica:  When will he be back?

Kyle:  I’m not sure.  He hasn’t been here for a cou ple of days.

Veronica:  A couple of days?!  He’s supposed to be here overseeing the day-to- day operations.  You’re his second-in-command.  Whe re is he?

Kyle:  I honestly don’t know.  He’s been MIA since Tuesday.

Veronica:  I come all the way here to talk to him a bout budget overruns and I find that he’s been shirking his responsibilities, too.  I’ve a feeling he’s been phoning it in for a long time now.  So have you been coveri ng for him?

Kyle:  Me?  I’m just trying to do my job.  When Sta n isn’t here, I do my best to fill in.  But I’m not saying anything against Stan.

Veronica:  I appreciate your loyalty, but when push  comes to shove, you’ve got to look out for yourself, right?

Kyle:  Uh, I guess.  I’m not sure.

Veronica:  Well, I do.  I need to look out for my b est interests and that’s making sure this place has proper supervision.  How would you like a promotion?

Kyle:  You mean you’re firing Stan and giving me hi s job?

Veronica:  Do you want the job or don’t you?

Kyle:  Can I talk to Stan first?  I don’t want him to think I’m a backstabber.

Veronica:  You can…if you can find him.

[end of dialogue]

Our scriptwriter never shirks her responsibilities;  she’s always up to the job. That’s because it’s the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.  I think she needs a promotion, don’t you?





# Starting a New School Year

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 717: Starting a New School Year.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode and for all of our current episodes that wi ll help you improve your English faster than ever.

This episode is a dialogue between a mother and her  son, Paul.  They’re talking about things that a young student would need when t hey begin their school year. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mom:  It’s your first day at a new school.  I’m wor ried about you.

Paul:  Mom, I’ll be fine.

Mom:  Do you have all of your books and supplies in  your backpack?  Oh and I’ve packed you a lunch already.

Paul:  You didn’t have to do that, Mom.  I was goin g to buy lunch at school.

Mom:  Now you won’t have to.  I hope you make some new friends.  It’s no fun being a loner.  It’s not that you have to be popula r.  I just don’t want you to feel left out.

Paul:  I’ll be fine, Mom.  I’d better go, or I’ll b e late.

Mom:  Do you think the school will do something spe cial to kick off the new school year?  I hope your teachers aren’t too stric t.  Oh, your backpack weights a ton!  But you can leave most of your books in your locker, right?

Paul:  They don’t have lockers at my new school, bu t I’ll be fine.

Mom:  I hope the teachers don’t already have seatin g plans.  I know you like to sit near the back of the classroom.  And I hope you  won’t have too much homework on the first day…

Paul:  Mom, stop fussing.  Everything will be fine.

Mom:  You’re my baby and I’m worried about you.

Paul:  Mom, I’m not starting kindergarten.  I’m sta rting college, remember?

[end of dialogue]

Mom begins by saying to Paul, “It’s your first day at a new school.  I’m worried about you.”  Paul says, “Mom, I’ll be fine.”  I’ll be okay; don’t worry about me. Mom says, “Do you have all of your books and suppli es in your backpack?”  The word “supplies” means all of the things that you ne ed for a particular purpose, for a specific thing that you are going to do, especial ly in school or in an office. Office supplies would include pens, paper, notebook s, uh…paperclips, that sort of thing – things you use in an office.  School sup plies would be things that students typically use in school, often things that  you use up, or consume, so that you need to get more in the future.  A “backpack” ( one word) is a usually cloth or leather bag that you wear on your back; it has some thing so that you can put it on both of your shoulders.  It’s common in many sch ools for children – students – to have backpacks to carry their books and supplies  from class to class.  It wasn’t very common when I was in school, maybe because we didn’t study very much so we didn’t have very many books!  I’m not sure.  But I didn’t have a backpack in high school; I did have a backpack in college, a nd at the university it’s very common to see backpacks.  In many high schools you have a place where you keep your books that’s called a “locker” (locker); it’s a little space for each student.  I’m not sure if schools still have locker s; I think many of them do, but it’s something you would find in a high school.  At the university, you would have to have a backpack, or if you were in elementary or gr ade school as a younger student.  It’s interesting, backpacks are considere d for children in some countries, but in the United States you will find t hem mostly at the university.

Mom continues by saying, “Oh and I’ve packed you a lunch already.”  “To pack (someone) a lunch” means usually to put some food –  a sandwich, an apple, perhaps a candy bar – into a small bag so they can take it with them.  You might pack a lunch if you are going on a trip in your car  and don’t want to stop to eat. Packing a lunch is common for people going to work who don’t want to spend money buying food at a restaurant.

Paul, I guess, has a lot of money because he says, “You didn’t have to do that, Mom.  I was going to buy lunch at school.”  Mom say s, “Now you won’t have to.  I hope you make some new friends.”  Remember, it’s a new school for Paul.  She says, “It’s no fun being a loner.”  A “loner” (lone r) is a person who is very quiet, who doesn’t have a lot of friends, who sits by him or herself.  That would be a loner.  “It’s not that you have to be popular,” Mom  says, “I just don’t want you to feel left out.”  “To be popular” means to be liked by many other people.  “Popular” has some other meanings as well; take a look at our  Learning Guide for those. “To feel left out” means to feel that or think that  you don’t belong to any group, that people are not accepting you, that they did no t invite you to do something with them.  Paul says, “I’ll be fine, Mom.  I’d bet ter go, or I’ll be late.”  I should go, he’s saying, because if I don’t I will be late.

Mom says, “Do you think the school will do somethin g special to kick off the new school year?”  “To kick off” is a phrasal verb that  here means to start something, especially with a lot of enthusiasm.  “We’re going to kick off our celebration by singing and dancing.”  We’re going to begin it; we’ re going to start it.  “Kick” has a number of different meanings; take a look at our Le arning Guide for some additional ones.  The “school year” is sometimes ca lled the “academic year.”  In most American schools it begins in late August-earl y September and ends in May or June, depending on the school.  Mom continues, “ I hope your teachers aren’t too strict.”  “To be strict” (strict) means to foll ow all of the rules and make sure that you follow all of the rules, that you obey the  rules.  So, a strict teacher would be someone, for example, who doesn’t allow anyone t o talk in class, and if they do they would be punished.  Of course, the teacher can talk and the teacher can ask students to answer questions.  But, a strict te acher would follow the rules and be very serious about them and punish people wh o don’t follow the rules.

So, Mom is asking or hoping that the teachers that Paul has won’t be too strict. She says, “Oh, your backpack weights a ton!”  A “to n” (ton) is a unit of measurement equal to 2,000 pounds.  But the express ion “to weigh a ton” means that something is very heavy, that it weighs a lot.   It doesn’t actually weigh a ton, but it’s very heavy.  Mom says, “But you can leave most of your books in your locker, right?”  I mentioned earlier that in American high schools many of them have lockers (lockers).  These are basically little  storage places that each student has; they’re given one were they can put their book s and lunch and other supplies.  In most schools, you need to lock your l ocker; you need to bring or to buy a lock; the school usually doesn’t give you a l ock.  You have to get one yourself, with a key or a combination lock.  Locker s are popular in high schools, in some junior high schools, and elementary schools .  If you’ve watched almost any movie about American high schools, you will kno w what lockers are. Students often spend time at them in between their classes talking.  It’s popular

in many schools to put pictures inside of your lock er; girls often put pictures of attractive actors and singers, that sort of thing.  I don’t think I ever put a picture of anyone in my locker.  I did remember having a calen dar in my last year of school, where I would at the end of each day cross off – pu t an “X” on the calendar for that day, counting the number of days left of schoo l.  You can tell I really loved my high school!

Anyway, Paul says that his new school doesn’t have lockers.  Mom says, “I hope the teachers don’t already have seating plans.”  A “seating plan” is when a teacher decides where each student will sit.  Somet imes teachers will put students in alphabetical order, so if your last nam e begins with “A” you sit in the front and if your last name begins with “Z” you sit  in the back.  Other teachers make seating plans based on other criteria – other reasons.  I used to have a seating plan.  I would let students sit where they wanted to – this is when I was a high school teacher many years ago, 20 years ago – and then after the first day I would write their names down, where they were, and that’s where they had to stay unless they caused problems, in which case I w ould move them to a different seat.  That’s a seating plan, and it’s ve ry popular in high schools and elementary schools.

Mom says, “I know you like to sit near the back of the classroom.”  The “classroom” is the room where the students sit and the teacher stands in front and gives the lesson.  I, personally, always liked to sit in the back of the classroom.  Mom says, “And I hope you won’t have to o much homework on the first day.”  “Homework” are things that students ha ve to do outside of school for their class; we might call them “school assignments .”

Paul then says, “Mom, stop fussing.”  This is a goo d word.  “To fuss” (fuss) means to worry about many things that other people don’t think are very important.  You’re worrying about small things, thi ngs that aren’t important, but you are acting as if they were important; this is t o fuss.  It’s a criticism to say someone is fussing, and Paul is criticizing his mot her by saying “stop fussing.” “Everything will be fine,” he says.  Mom says, “You ’re my baby and I’m worried about you.”  Paul says, “Mom, I’m not starting kind ergarten.”  “Kindergarten” is school for young children, usually five years old.  In many places you go to kindergarten first.  It’s not required, but many sc hools offer a kindergarten program for five-year-olds, and then when you’re si x years old you begin first grade – the first grade of elementary school.  Befo re kindergarten there is what’s called “preschool.”  When I was a child, I think I went to preschool for a half a day for at least a few months.  It was not at a regular  school; it was at a public building – a park actually.  And then, kindergarten  was also half-day; that is, I didn’t go the whole day, I went in the morning and then came home in the

afternoon.  That’s when I was five years old.  Anyw ay, as interesting as my life may be, let’s finish up the story here.  Paul says,  “I’m not starting kindergarten. I’m starting college, remember?”  And that, of cour se, is the joke.  Mom is treating Paul as if he were a young child, when in fact his new school is the university.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mom:  It’s your first day at a new school.  I’m wor ried about you.

Paul:  Mom, I’ll be fine.

Mom:  Do you have all of your books and supplies in  your backpack?  Oh and I’ve packed you a lunch already.

Paul:  You didn’t have to do that, Mom.  I was goin g to buy lunch at school.

Mom:  Now you won’t have to.  I hope you make some new friends.  It’s no fun being a loner.  It’s not that you have to be popula r.  I just don’t want you to feel left out.

Paul:  I’ll be fine, Mom.  I’d better go, or I’ll b e late.

Mom:  Do you think the school will do something spe cial to kick off the new school year?  I hope your teachers aren’t too stric t.  Oh, your backpack weights a ton!  But you can leave most of your books in your locker, right?

Paul:  They don’t have lockers at my new school, bu t I’ll be fine.

Mom:  I hope the teachers don’t already have seatin g plans.  I know you like to sit near the back of the classroom.  And I hope you  won’t have too much homework on the first day…

Paul:  Mom, stop fussing.  Everything will be fine.

Mom:  You’re my baby and I’m worried about you.

Paul:  Mom, I’m not starting kindergarten.  I’m sta rting college, remember?

# Serving on a Jury

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 718: Serving on a Jury.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 718.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Samantha and Jin ho; it is talking about being on a “jury,” a group of people in a courtroom who d ecide whether someone is innocent or guilty.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Samantha:  How was your first day on a jury?

Jinho:  It was okay.  The judge swore us in and the n we listened to the beginning of the prosecutor’s case.  Two witnesses testified.

Samantha:  That sounds exciting!  I’d love to be on  a jury.  Why didn’t they sequester you?  That’s what they do on TV.

Jinho:  We didn’t need to be sequestered.  This isn ’t a high-profile case.  Hey, guess what?  I was selected as foreman.

Samantha:  Wow, that’s a lot of responsibility.

Jinho:  It’s no big deal.  I think I was selected b ecause nobody else wanted the job.

Samantha:  What’ll happen tomorrow?

Jinho:  We’ll hear the rest of the prosecutor’s cas e and then the defense attorney will put on her case.  I’m sure the entire thing wi ll be over in three or four days.

Samantha:  Were there any interesting exhibits?  Wi ll the defendant take the stand?

Jinho:  No, no interesting exhibits so far, and I’m  not sure if the defendant will take the stand.

Samantha:  I wish I were in your place.  I’d love t o put a criminal behind bars.

Jinho:  You’re supposed to be impartial when you’re  on a jury, remember?

Samantha:  Oh sure, I’d only convict the guilty def endants – just like on TV!

[end of dialogue]

Samantha begins by asking Jinho, “How was your firs t day on a jury?”  A “jury” (jury) is a group of people in a courtroom, in a le gal case, who decide whether someone is innocent or guilty – whether they did the crime or did not do the crime.  Juries can also be used to decide whether o ne person has wronged another person and has to pay them money.  Juries can be used for both criminal cases, cases involving someone breaking the law, as  well as civil cases, cases involving people who have damaged or done damage to  someone else, and that person is trying to get money back from them.

Jinho says, “It was okay.  The judge swore us in an d then we listened to the beginning of the prosecutor’s case.”  The “judge” i s the man or woman who is sort of the boss of the courtroom.  When you go to a court, there’ll be one person who is in charge, who decides who talks or who can say what.  This person sometimes makes a decision about whether someone is  guilty or innocent in some courtrooms.  But for most cases, there is a gr oup of citizens, what we call the “jury,” typically 12 of them, who make the deci sion.

So, the judge swore the jury in.  “Swore” is the pa st tense of the verb “swear.” “To swear in (someone)” or “to swear (someone) in” means to make them repeat a statement, a sentence or two, where they promise to do something.  For a jury, they promise to listen to the facts of the case and  make an honest determination – an honest decision about whether the person is gu ilty or not.  For someone who is a “witness,” someone who is going to be givi ng evidence in the case, that person is sworn in to tell the truth.  The traditio nal phrase is “To tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,” that is, o nly the truth.

So, the judge swore in the jury, “and then we liste ned to the beginning of the prosecutors case,” Jinho says.  I should mention th at “swear” has a couple of other meanings in English as well, some important m eanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for those.  The “prosecutor” is the lawyer – the attorney – who works for the government, and his or her job is to show that this person is guilty.

The person works for and defends person who is bein g accused of a crime – that is, the person that they are trying to put in jail,  that attorney is called the “defense” attorney.  So you have a defense attorney  and a prosecuting attorney in a criminal case.  In a civil case, you have a “p laintiff,” someone who’s making a complaint, and a “defendant,” someone who is defend ing themselves against this complaint.  Well, in this case we have a criminal c ase, so there’s a prosecutor from the government.  After they were sworn in, Jin ho says that two witnesses testified.  A “witness” is a person who has some kn owledge about the event, or in this case the crime.  “To testify” means to formall y make a statement, to go in front of the judge and the jury and to say what you  think happened or what you know about a certain case.

Samantha says, “That sounds exciting!  I’d love to be on a jury.  Why didn’t they sequester you?  That’s what they do on TV.”  “To se quester” (sequester) means to isolate.  Sometimes when there’s a very importan t case the judge doesn’t want the jury to become influenced by the newspapers and  other people talking about the case, so they will sequester the jury.  They’ll  put them in a hotel, take away their televisions, not allow them to read the newsp aper until trial is over.  This is not a common procedure; it’s not done very often.  It’s only done for very famous cases; cases, that is, that are getting a lot of pu blicity, a lot of newspaper coverage.  Here in Los Angeles, the O.J. Simpson mu rder trial 20 years ago was a case where they had a sequestered jury.  Samantha  says, “That’s what they do on TV,” meaning well, that’s what television shows show happening.  But of course, that’s not reality.

Jinho says, “We didn’t need to be sequestered.  Thi s isn’t a high-profile case.” Something that is “high-profile” is something that is receiving a lot of attention because it is important or involves someone famous.   Celebrities – famous people here in Los Angeles are always getting into trouble with drugs or alcohol, and sometimes they get caught by the police and the y have to go to court.  That would be an example of a high-profile case, somethi ng that everyone is paying attention to.

Jinho says, “Hey, guess what?  I was selected as fo reman.”  The “foreman” (foreman) is the leader of the jury.  He or she is the person who is in charge of the jury, helping the jury make a decision.  They s till just have one vote, but the jury selects a leader so that you can have one pers on leading the discussion during the time when they discuss whether the perso n is guilty or innocent after the end of all the testimony – of all the evidence.   That period is called “deliberations,” when they sit around in a group by  themselves to decide whether the person was guilty or not.

Samantha says, “Wow, that’s a lot of responsibility .”  Jinho says, “It’s no big deal,” meaning it wasn’t that important.  “I think I was selected because nobody else wanted the job,” that is, no one else wanted t o be the foreman.  Samantha says, “What happens tomorrow?”  Jinho says, “We’ll hear the rest of the prosecutor’s case and then the defense attorney wil l put on her case.” Remember, the defense attorney is the person defend ing the person who is being accused of the crime.  Jinho says, “I’m sure the entire thing will be over in three or four days.”

Samantha says, “Were there any interesting exhibits ?”  “Exhibits” in a courtroom case are objects or documents related to the case t hat are brought in and shown to the jury and discussed by the attorneys.  “Exhib it” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for some more of those. Samantha asks if there were any interesting exhibit s; she then asks, “Will the defendant take the stand?”  The “defendant” is the person who is being defended by the defense attorney, the person being accused of the crime that the government wants to put in jail.  “To take the stan d” means to stand up – actually to go into a chair and sit and give an official sta tement about what happened. You can take the stand as a witness, you know somet hing and so you go and you tell what you know.  Or, you could take the sta nd as the defendant, the person who is being accused of the crime.

Jinho says, “No, no interesting exhibits so far, an d I’m not sure if the defendant will take the stand.”  Samantha says, “I wish I wer e in your place.  I’d love to put a criminal behind bars.”  “To put a criminal behind  bars” means to punish someone who has broken the law by putting them in j ail.  Of course, that’s what a jury does; if they decide the person is guilty they  are putting him or her behind bars, that is, in a prison – in a jail.  Jinho says , “You’re supposed to be impartial when you’re on a jury, remember?”  “To be impartial ” (impartial) means to be able to listen to what other people say and make a fair decision, not one based on your own ideas, not biased.  We might also say t o make an “objective” decision.  Samantha says, “Oh sure, I’d only convic t the guilty defendants – just like on TV!”  “To convict” means to find someone gu ilty in a courtroom trial.  “To be guilty,” as you probably know, is the opposite of “innocent,” meaning you’ve done something wrong, you’ve broken the law.  On the television shows we watch, of course, only the bad people – the guilty people are convicted, are put behind bars.  In the real world, it’s not quite tha t easy!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Samantha:  How was your first day on a jury?

Jinho:  It was okay.  The judge swore us in and the n we listened to the beginning of the prosecutor’s case.  Two witnesses testified.

Samantha:  That sounds exciting!  I’d love to be on  a jury.  Why didn’t they sequester you?  That’s what they do on TV.

Jinho:  You’re supposed to be impartial when you’re  on a jury, remember?

Samantha:  Oh sure, I’d only convict the guilty def endants – just like on TV!

I’m not impartial when it comes to scriptwriters; I  really like our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.  Thanks Lucy.





# Eating Unhealthy Foods

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 719: Eating Unhealthy Foods.

This episode is called “Eating Unhealthy Food,” foo d that would be bad for your health.  We’ll listen to a dialogue between Helen a nd Gabe about some unhealthy foods.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Helen:  So, what’s for lunch?

Gabe:  Since you were nice enough to spend your Sat urday morning helping me out, I’ll make sandwiches for lunch.  I know it doe sn’t sound like much, but I make a mean sandwich.

Helen:  That sounds good, but you’re not going to u se those cold cuts, are you?

Gabe:  I was.  Why?

Helen:  Those are processed meats made with additiv es and a lot of sodium – definitely not what you’d want to put into your bod y.

Gabe:  I eat these kinds of cold cuts all the time.

Helen:  You shouldn’t if you don’t want to eat a lo t saturated fat.

Gabe:  Okay, how about if I make us salads.

Helen:  Not with those greens.  Unless they’re orga nic, they’re full of pesticides and chemicals.

Gabe:  [sighs] All right, how about if I make us he althy smoothies?

Helen:  Only if you use only fresh fruit.  Bottled juices are full of high-fructose corn syrup.  Yuck!

Gabe:  I’ve got a great idea.

Helen:  What?

Gabe:  You pick the restaurant and I’ll buy you lun ch.

Helen:  I don’t want to put you to any trouble.

Gabe:  It’s no trouble at all.  [Said under his bre ath]  I’d do anything to get you out of my kitchen!

[end of dialogue]

Helen begins our dialogue by asking Gabe, “So, what ’s for lunch?” meaning what are we going to eat for lunch.  Gabe says, “Since y ou were nice enough to spend your Saturday morning helping me out, I’ll make san dwiches for lunch.”  “To help someone out” means to help another person.  Here, “ out,” like in a lot of phrasal verbs, has more of a meaning of emphasis.  “To help  someone” and “to help them out” are really the same thing.  Often we use this when another person helps you do some job that you need to get done; th ey don’t have to but they decide to help you – they help you out.

Gabe is going to make sandwiches for lunch; he says , “I know it doesn’t sound like much, but I make a mean sandwich.”  The expres sion “to not sound like much” means to appear to be unimportant, not signif icant, no big deal.  Gabe says he makes a mean (mean) sandwich.  “Mean” isn’t  a kind of meat or something you put in the sandwich.  It’s an adjecti ve which normally is negative; “to be mean” means to be unkind, not nice.  But, it  has an informal use, which is that it is excellent, it is great.  So, when Gabe s ays he makes a mean sandwich, he means he makes a very good sandwich.  For some r eason, there are lots of words in English that have a negative meaning in the dictionary in their normal meanings, but for some reason have become positive in informal English.  These change every year; many of them are part of slang s o I won’t talk about them at length, but “mean” is an example of one that has be en around for many years.

Helen says, “That sounds good, but you’re not going  to use those cold cuts, are you?”  “Cold cuts” (cuts) are thin pieces of what w e would call “processed” meat, things like bologna, pastrami, turkey, roast beef, ham; all of these could be called “cold cuts” when you cut them in thin pieces and us e them for a sandwich.

 Gabe says, “I was (meaning I was going to use the c old cuts).  Why?”  Helen says, “Those are processed meats made with additive s and a lot of sodium.” “Processed meats” are meats that are somehow change d; it’s not the same as when it came out of the animal.  They have done som ething to it – added, subtracted, changed it somehow.  “Process” has a co uple of different meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Gui de for some additional explanations.  Processed meats often have additives .  “To add” means to have more of something, so an “additive” is something th at is extra, something that is put in the food or some other substance in addition  to what normally goes in there.  It could be a chemical; it could be some ot her substance; it could be just something to change the color of the food.  “Sodium ” is another word for salt. Technically, it would be sodium chloride; in chemis try class you learn it as NaCl. There was a great line that my chemistry teacher in  high school taught us: “Little Johnny took a drink / But little Johnny is no more / ‘Cause what he thought was H2O / Was really H 2SO 4.”  This has nothing to do with sodium now that I r ealize it, but I love that little rhyme!  “H 2O” is water and “H 2SO 4” is sulfuric acid, which would kill you.  That’s why little Johnny, when he drank the H 2SO 4 is no more, because he’s dead.  For some reason, that’s the onl y thing I remember from my high school chemistry class!

Anyway, Helen says that you definitely do not want to put these processed meats into your body, meaning eat them.  Gabe says, “I ea t these kinds of cold cuts all the time.”  Helen says, “You shouldn’t if you don’t  want to eat a lot saturated fat.” “Saturated fat” is a type of fat that is solid, not  liquid, at room temperature, mostly found in animal products.  Saturated fat is thought  to be bad for your heart, among other things.  Helen says so if you don’t wan t saturated fat you should not eat cold cuts.

Gabe says, “Okay, how about if I make us salads.”  Helen says, “Not with those greens.”  “Greens” refer to vegetables – green vege tables, usually lettuce or spinach, perhaps kale; these are greens that you us e in a salad.  But Helen says, “Not with those greens.  Unless they’re organic, th ey’re full of pesticides and chemicals.”  “Organic,” in general, means grown wit hout using any artificial or man-made chemicals; it has more technical definitio ns depending on who you talk to.  Helen says that the greens are full of pe sticides and chemicals. “Pesticide” is a chemical used to kill bugs and ins ects and other living things that could hurt or damage the vegetables or other food t hat you are growing.  We call food that you grow to eat “crops” (crops) – not to be confused with “crap” (crap), which is what you can buy at McDonald’s!  Now, pest icides are supposed to kill insects, but some people think they also harm or ca n make humans sick. “Chemicals” is a general word for any substance, in  this case, created in a

laboratory by scientists for a particular purpose.  Again, it has a broader use, which we won’t talk about here.

Gabe sighs; he goes “ hhhha .”  “To sigh” is to breathe out through your mouth so that other people can hear you; “ hhhha ,” that’s to sigh.  Gabe sighs and says, “All right, how about if I make us healthy smoothies?”  A “smoothie” is a thick, cold drink made with fruit, ice, usually milk, some juic e – some fruit juice, sometimes with frozen yogurt or ice cream.  It’s a thick frui ty drink, you could call it.  Helen says, “Only if you use only fresh fruit.”  She says , “Bottled juices are full of high- fructose corn syrup.  Yuck!”  “High-fructose corn s yrup” is a sweet liquid made from corn that is used many times instead of sugar in processed foods.  It can be found in many different kinds of food.  Some people  think it’s bad for you, so that’s why Helen says, “Yuck!”  “Yuck” is a word we  use to mean it doesn’t taste very good; it’s not good for you to eat.

Gabe says, “I’ve got a great idea.”  Helen says, “W hat?”  Gabe says, “You pick the restaurant and I’ll buy you lunch.”  Helen says , “I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”  When you say you “don’t want to put (som eone) to any trouble” you mean you don’t want to create problems for them; yo u don’t want to create extra work for them.  Of course, Helen doesn’t want to ea t anything that Gabe is preparing, so Gabe says okay, well let’s go to a re staurant, and you pick the restaurant.  Helen is what we might call a “pain in  the butt.”  Gabe says, “It’s no trouble at all that,” but of course it is a trouble  and so he says under his breath, “I’d do anything to get you out of my kitchen!”  “T o say something under your breath” means to say it quietly to yourself so that  the other person can’t hear you or can’t hear exactly what you’re saying.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Helen:  So, what’s for lunch?

Gabe:  Since you were nice enough to spend your Sat urday morning helping me out, I’ll make sandwiches for lunch.  I know it doe sn’t sound like much, but I make a mean sandwich.

Helen:  That sounds good, but you’re not going to u se those cold cuts, are you?

# Buying Office Furniture

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 720: Buying Office Furniture.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 720.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Natalia and Kei discuss some office vocabulary dealing with office furniture.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Natalia:  Is that the Office Shop catalogue?

Kei:  Yeah, I’m in charge of furnishing the new off ices on the second floor.  They need everything – desks, file cabinets, bookcases –  you name it.

Natalia:  That sounds like fun.  I love shopping for new furniture.  Can I help?

Kei:  Yes, definitely.  I’ve picked out a few thing s already, but I’m having a hard time deciding among all of these office chairs.

Natalia:  Get this one.  They’re on casters and are  fully adjustable.

Kei:  Okay, what about desks?  Everybody has a diff erent idea about office desks.

Natalia:  I like this one.  It’s got a keyboard tra y, file drawers, and space for lateral files.  See?

Kei:  All right, I guess that one is as good as any , but what about this one with a hutch?

Natalia:  This desk has an optional hutch.  If the new employees want a hutch, they can order one later.

Kei:  Okay, last but not least, we need bookcases.

Natalia:  These are solid wood and look sturdy.  What do you think?

Kei:  I think there’s one person who’s cut out for this job, and that person is not me!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Natalia saying, “Is that t he Office Shop catalogue?” Office Shop is the name of some store that sells of fice material, not a real place. A “catalogue” is a printed book with many pages tha t usually contains photographs and descriptions – pictures and text ab out what a particular company sells.  So, you might have a clothing catal ogue that shows all the latest dresses and shirts, pants, that sort of thing; you could have a office furniture catalogue that shows things that you can buy for yo ur office.  Catalogues are becoming less common because people now sell on the  Internet and you don’t need to send them a book.

Kei says, “Yeah, I’m in charge of furnishing the ne w offices on the second floor.” “To furnish” (furnish) is a verb meaning to buy fur niture, things like desks and chairs for a certain place, for a house or, in this  case, for an office.  The noun “furnishings” (plural) refers to furniture, but the  verb “to furnish” means to go and buy – select and buy furniture for a particular pla ce.  Kei says that the second floor offices need everything, “desks, file cabinet s, bookcases – you name it.”  A “desk” is a large piece of furniture, like a table,  that you are able to write on or put your computer on and other objects: paper, pencils,  that sort of thing.  Desks can be very small, like a school desk where a student s its, or it can be very large, like what the president of the company might have.  “Fil e cabinets” (sometimes called “filing cabinets,” they’re the same thing) are larg e – typically large pieces of furniture that have big drawers in them – boxes, if  you will, that pull out and you can put into them pieces of paper that are put into  cardboard files.  A “file” is a large piece of cardboard that is folded in half and  you put papers in it, just like you would put meat in a sandwich, and then you put these files into a drawer – a large box – and then that drawer goes into the file  cabinet.  A “cabinet” is a general term for a place to store things – to keep things.  So here, we are keeping the files; it’s a file cabinet.  “Bookcases ” (one word) are large pieces of furniture that hold books, of course.  A bookcase h as straight, flat pieces of either metal or wood, usually two or three, sometimes more ; these are called “shelves.” Individually, it’s a “shelf” (shelf).  And, you put  the books on the shelves.  Kei says they need “desks, file cabinets, bookcases – y ou name it.”  This is an expression; when someone says, “you name it,” they mean that they have given

you a list of possible things, but there are even m ore things that they could say. It’s as if you are starting a list, but then you st op because there are so many things on the list, you use the things that you say  as a sample – as an example.

Natalia says, “That sounds like fun.”  I’m not sure  if she’s joking or being serious there.  “I love shopping for new furniture.”  So I guess she’s serious, she does think this will be fun.  “Can I help?”  Kei says, “ Yes, definitely.  I’ve picked out (I’ve selected a few things here) a few things alre ady, but I’m having a hard time (I’m having a difficult time) deciding among all of  these office chairs.”  A “chair,” of course, is what you sit on; an “office chair” wo uld be a chair that you would typically find in an office.  Often office chairs a re adjustable; you can make them taller or shorter depending on what you want.

Natalia says, “Get this one (meaning buy this one).   They’re on casters and are fully adjustable.”  “Casters” (casters) are small w heels that you put on the bottom of a chair or any very heavy furniture so that you can move it back and forth easily.  You might have a desk on casters, possible .  You probably wouldn’t have a bookcase on casters, but you might have a small f iling cabinet on casters so you could move it back and forth easily.  Natalia s ays that the chairs that he should buy should be adjustable.  “Adjustable” mean s you can move it in different positions, as I was saying earlier, you can make it  higher or lower for example.

Kei says, “Okay, what about desks?  Everybody has a  different idea about office desks.”  Natalia says, “I like this one.  It’s got a keyboard tray, file drawers, and space for lateral files.  See?”  A “keyboard tray” is a small, flat piece of wood or metal that goes underneath your desk, and you can p ull it out and type on it – put your keyboard there so you can enter information in to your computer.  The reason that some desks have keyboard trays is becau se the desk is too tall and in order to have a comfortable position for typing you want the keyboard to be lower than the top of the desk.  A “file drawer” is  similar to what we talked about when we discussed file cabinets.  A “file drawer” i s a drawer that you put files in that’s in a desk; a “file cabinet” is separate from  the desk.  “Lateral files” are a kind of file drawer – file system where the files a re facing either left or right. Normally when you have a file cabinet, you pull out  the drawer and the files are all facing you.  In other words, they are in a dire ction so you can read them easily.  To have a “lateral file” means that the fi les are basically at 90 degrees from where you are so that they don’t face the same  direction as the drawer pulling out, they face in a perpendicular direction  – if that makes any sense.

Kei says, “All right, I guess that one is as good a s any (meaning that’s good enough), but what about this one with a hutch?”  A “hutch” (hutch) is something that goes on top of your desk; it’s usually somethi ng that has some places for

storing things.  So, it’s like a storage cabinet th at goes on the top of a desk, usually at the back of the desk.  Sometimes it can be a place to put your computer, sometimes it’s a place for other equipmen t, it depends on the desk and the hutch.

Natalia says, “This desk has an optional hutch.”  S omething that is “optional” means that it doesn’t have to go with the desk; you  can choose it or not, it isn’t required.  Natalia says, “If the new employees want  a hutch, they can order one later.”  They can get one after they first start us ing the desk.

Kei says, “Okay, last but not least (meaning this i s the last thing we need to do, but it’s not necessarily the least important), we n eed bookcases.”  Natalia says, “These are solid wood and look sturdy.”  “Solid” us ually means strong or well built, something that is firm, something that is st able.  “Solid” has some other meanings in English as well; take a look at our Lea rning Guide for those. “Sturdy” (sturdy) also means strong, well built, so mething that won’t fall down or fall apart easily.  Natalia says, “What do you thin k?”  Kei says, “I think there’s one person who’s cut out for this job, and that person is not me!”  “To be cut out for (something)” means to be well qualified to do somet hing or to be well prepared to do something.  You might say, “I’m not cut out for doing heavy lifting,” or, “I’m not cut out for painting,” it’s not something I would d o a very good job at.  That’s what I tell my wife all the time!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Natalia:  Is that the Office Shop catalogue?

Kei:  Yeah, I’m in charge of furnishing the new off ices on the second floor.  They need everything – desks, file cabinets, bookcases –  you name it.

Natalia:  That sounds like fun.  I love shopping for new furniture.  Can I help?

Kei:  Yes, definitely.  I’ve picked out a few thing s already, but I’m having a hard time deciding among all of these office chairs.

Natalia:  Get this one.  They’re on casters and are  fully adjustable.

Kei:  Okay, what about desks?  Everybody has a diff erent idea about office desks.

Natalia:  I like this one.  It’s got a keyboard tra y, file drawers, and space for lateral files.  See?

Kei:  All right, I guess that one is as good as any , but what about this one with a hutch?

Natalia:  This desk has an optional hutch.  If the new employees want a hutch, they can order one later.

Kei:  Okay, last but not least, we need bookcases.

Natalia:  These are solid wood and look sturdy.  What do you think?

Kei:  I think there’s one person who’s cut out for this job, and that person is not me!

# A Widespread Epidemic

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 721: A Widespread Epidemic.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 721.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can become a member  of ESL Podcast and download a Learning Guide for this episode, all on our wonderful website.

This episode is a dialogue between Alan and Katja a bout sicknesses or illnesses that spread very quickly, that affect many people i n a short amount of time.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alan:  Did you see today’s news?  There’s been an o utbreak of Podcaster’s Disease in the city.

Katja:  Oh, my God, not Podcaster’s Disease!  I wou ld not want to come down with that.

Alan:  The first outbreak was at the local high sch ool, and the health authorities thought it was localized.  But a second, more wides pread, outbreak has been reported at the city’s government offices.

Katja:  That’s terrible!  I thought Podcaster’s Dis ease was very rare.

Alan:  It is, and that’s why the authorities are so  alarmed.  It’s highly communicable, so they’re hoping it won’t turn into an epidemic, or worse, a pandemic.

Katja:  I’ve heard that this disease is horrible, b ut I’m not sure what the symptoms are.  Do you know?

Alan:  From what I’ve read, sufferers of Podcaster’ s Disease can’t stop talking and they speak in an announcer’s voice all the time .

Katja:  Oh, my God, what a terrible fate!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Alan saying to Katja, “Did  you see today’s news? There’s been an outbreak of Podcaster’s Disease in the city.”  An “outbreak” (outbreak – one word) is the moment when something begins and it starts to affect many people quickly.  Usually, an outbreak i s related to some illness or sickness that people are starting to get.  A “disea se” is just another word for an illness, a sickness.  So, this is an imaginary dise ase called Podcaster’s Disease.

Katja says, “Oh, my God, not Podcaster’s Disease!  I would not want to come down with that.”  The expression “to come down with  (something)” means to get a particular illness, to become sick with something .  “I’m coming down with a cold” means that I am starting to get a cold.  “I’m  coming down with the flu” means I’m starting to get the influenza illness – t he flu.

“The first outbreak,” Alan says, “was at the local high school, and the health authorities thought it was localized.”  The “health  authorities” would be the government doctors and other important officials wh o make decisions about issues of health in a state or area.  To say someth ing is “localized” means it’s just affecting one small particular area, it doesn’t aff ect things around it.  Because the first outbreak was at the local high school, the lo cal high school kids got sick, they thought it was just there.  “But a second, mor e widespread, outbreak has been reported at the city’s government offices.”  S o there are now two places where people are getting sick.  When we say somethi ng is “widespread” (one word), we mean it covers or affects a very large ar ea.

Katja says, “That’s terrible!  I thought Podcaster’ s Disease was very rare.” Something that is “rare” is unusual, uncommon, not typical.  Alan says, “It is (meaning it is rare), and that’s why the authoritie s are so alarmed.”  “To be alarmed” means to be surprised and worried.  You mi ght be worried about something bad that is happening; you might be “shoc ked,” we would say.  Alan says that this disease is highly communicable.  Whe n we talk about an illness or a disease being “communicable,” we mean that it can  be passed from one person to another or from one animal to another ver y easily.  “Highly communicable diseases” are diseases that can spread  very easily from one person to another.  Another word for this is “conta gious” (contagious).  Alan says that the health authorities are hoping that this di sease won’t turn into – won’t develop into or become – an epidemic.  An “epidemic ” (epidemic) is when many people become sick from a particular disease in a s hort period of time.  An epidemic can affect a large group of people.  A “pa ndemic” (pandemic) is an illness that affects people in many different parts  of the whole world.  So, a

“pandemic” would be a disease that many people suff er in many different countries.

Katja says, “I’ve heard that this disease is horrib le, but I’m not sure what the symptoms are.”  A “symptom” (symptom) is something that is wrong with your body that indicates that there’s a problem.  If you  have a cold, your symptoms might be a sore throat or sneezing a lot.  Katja sa ys, “Do you know (what the symptoms are)?”  Alan says, “From what I’ve read, s ufferers of Podcaster’s Disease can’t stop talking.”  A “sufferer” (suffere r) comes from the verb “to suffer.”  It’s a person who has a disease that feel s pain and discomfort. Sometimes we use the expression “I suffer from….”  “I suffer from allergies.” That means that allergies bother me, they affect me , I have that disease. “Sufferers” are the people who have a disease.  All en says that the sufferers of Podcaster’s Disease can’t stop talking and they spe ak in an announcer’s voice all of the time.  An “announcer” is a person usually wh o presents information, especially on a television or radio program.  The s ports announcer is the person who describes what is happening in the game to the people watching or listening. A news announcer is someone who announces or gives – tells people about the news.  So, Podcaster’s Disease causes people to tal k as if they were announcers all of the time.  An announcer usually has a certai n voice on television.  [In a deep voice] “Hello and welcome to the news.  My nam e is Jeff McQuillan.  In tonight’s top stories….”  That’s kind of an announc er’s voice.  Some people say I talk in an announcer’s voice.  Usually my wife tell s me that sometimes.  Not always, sometimes.  Maybe I have Podcaster’s Diseas e!

Katja says, once again, “Oh, my God.”  “Oh my God” is a very common expression nowadays, especially among young people.   On email or in text messages or instant messages it’s sometimes abbrevi ated “OMG.”  And now, people even talk in abbreviations; someone might ev en say to you, “OMG,” meaning oh, my God.  It’s an expression of shock – of surprise.  It’s become popular in the last, I don’t know, maybe 10 or 15 y ears.  It’s always been an expression in English, but for whatever reason it’s  become more popular among younger people on the Internet.  Some people don’t like the expression; religious people think that you shouldn’t use the name of God  that way.  It is, however, a very common thing that you will hear.

Katja says, “Oh, my God, what a terrible fate!”  “T errible” is very bad, awful, horrible.  “Fate” (fate) is the outcome of a partic ular situation, what happens as a result of a certain situation.  Some people talk ab out “fate” as being what will happen to you that you cannot control.  Some people  believe that there is someone controlling you or some thing controlling y ou, and you can’t avoid it and

you can’t do anything about it; you can’t control it in any way.  This is a very old idea; it goes back at least to the ancient Greeks, who believed in a form of fate.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alan:  Did you see today’s news?  There’s been an o utbreak of Podcaster’s Disease in the city.

Katja:  Oh, my God, not Podcaster’s Disease!  I wou ld not want to come down with that.

This episode is a dialogue between Cleo and Victor;  they’re talking about television shows and some common vocabulary we migh t use when we talk about TV shows.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cleo:  The new TV season is starting this week and I can’t wait.  I’ve been watching reruns all summer and I’m ready for the pr emiers of my favorite shows.

Victor:  You watch Madwomen , right?

Cleo:  Yes, it’s my favorite show.

Victor:  Then I’ve got some bad news for you.  It’s  been cancelled.

Cleo:  How is that possible?  The show was on hiatu s last season because of contract negotiations, but I heard that it had been  renewed for another season. The season finale was a cliffhanger!

Victor:  I know, but something must have gone wrong .  They filmed two episodes, which they’ll air, but then there’ll be a mid-seaso n replacement.

Cleo:  This is outrageous!  I’ve been waiting nearl y two years for its return.  Oh well, at least I can watch my other favorite show t onight, Reviver .

Victor:  Sorry, but it’s been preempted.  The presi dent is giving a televised speech tonight.

Cleo:  Are you kidding me?!

Victor:  Nope, sorry.

Cleo:  The world is conspiring against me.  I’ve ha d enough.  I’m giving up TV watching!

Victor:  You?  That I’ve got to see!

[end of dialogue]

Cleo begins by saying to Victor, “The new TV season  is starting this week and I can’t wait.”  The TV season traditionally has been the time of year where most of the new entertainment television shows are shown.  This, in the U.S., is usually between September until May, so the TV season typic ally starts in September. Everyone is back from vacation, the children are at  school, and people are watching more television.  That’s the idea; they st art the new shows in September, so the TV season would be that period of  time.  A “season” is a period of time; it could be weeks, it could be mont hs.  There are four seasons in the year: we talk about summer, winter, fall, and s pring.  But we can also have a season for some other event or some other activity,  baseball season or football season for example.

Cleo says, “I’ve been watching reruns all summer an d I’m ready for the premiers of my favorite shows.”  A “rerun” (rerun) is a tele vision show that is shown more than once; the same episodes are shown again, somet imes on the same television station or channel.  A rerun could be so mething from a show that is still producing new shows.  During summertime, the big te levision stations usually show episodes of television programs from the previ ous year; they have been shown once, but now they’re showing them again.  So metimes, reruns can go many years after the show is no longer on the air –  that is, are no longer producing new shows.  There are many examples of th is: Friends , M.A.S.H ., Seinfeld .  Those are three television shows that have, we w ould say, “been in syndication.”  They have been showing the reruns on  different television channels for many years.

Cleo is tired of watching reruns; she’s ready for t he premiers of her favorite shows.  A “premier” (premier) is the first time tha t something is shown or seen. In this case, it would be the first episode of a te levision show beginning the new TV season.

Victor says, “You watch Madwomen , right?”  Madwomen  is not a real television show; there is a real television show called Mad Me n, but this is a different show. Cleo says, “Yes, it’s my favorite show.”  Victor sa ys, “Then I’ve got some bad

news for you (I have something bad or unfortunate t o tell you).  It’s been cancelled.”  “To cancel” (cancel) means to decide n ot to continue doing something that was supposed to continue to be done.   For example, a television show may be cancelled after its first season; maybe  it wasn’t very popular. Sometimes television shows are canceled after only two or three episodes; if no one is watching them the television station – the t elevision, we would call it, “network,” the national company – will cancel a sho w.

Cleo says, “How is that possible?  The show was on hiatus last season because of contract negotiations, but I heard that it had b een renewed for another season.”  “Hiatus” (hiatus) is a break or a pause i n something or in a series of things.  When we say a television show is “on hiatu s,” we mean that they are not actually working on it right now.  That’s a word yo u’ll hear in Los Angeles when you talk to people who work in the movie or televis ion industry; here we simply call it “the Industry.”  A television show will be in hiatus; it will not be filming, they will not be actually making the new episodes during  a certain period of time. Cleo says that this show was on hiatus the entire l ast season – last year – because of contract negotiations.  “Contract negoti ations” are discussions between two or more people to determine how much yo u should be paid.  If an actor has contract negotiations, he’s trying to get  more money from the television company – the production company.

Cleo says, “I heard that (her favorite show) had be en renewed for another season.”  If a television show is popular, they wil l continue it for another set of shows – another season, and that’s called “renewing ” the show (renewing).  She says – Cleo – that she thought the show had been re newed.  “The season finale was a cliffhanger!”  A “season finale” of a televis ion show is the final episode of that year.  We talked about the “premier” being the  first episode; the “finale” is the final episode.  If the television show is being can celled, sometimes they’ll have a “series finale,” the last episode they will ever ma ke.  The season finale, according to Cleo, last year was a cliffhanger.  A “cliffhang er” (one word) is a story in a television show or perhaps a movie that has a very exciting ending but it doesn’t end completely; it doesn’t tell you what happens ne xt, and it makes you want to find out what happens next.  We call that a cliffha nger.

Victor says, “I know, but something must have gone wrong (there must have been a problem).  They filmed two episodes (they ma de – they produced two episodes), which they’ll air, but then there’ll be a mid-season replacement.”  An “episode” is one of many shows in a series of shows .  We have different podcast episodes each week, three every week.  Well, televi sion shows have episodes. “They filmed two episodes,” Victor says, “which the y will air.”  “To air” (air) as a verb means to show on television; “to broadcast” on  television, we used to say.

After they show or air those two episodes, Victor s ays, “there will be a mid- season replacement.”  A “replacement” is something that takes the place of another thing.  “Mid-season” would be sometime betw een September and May, before the complete season ends.  A television seas on for a TV show might have 25, maybe 30 episodes, usually a little less.  A mi d-season replacement might happen in November, December, or January, when a sh ow isn’t very popular and so they put on a new show.

Cleo says, “This is outrageous (this is terrible)!  I’ve been waiting two years for Madwomen ’s return.  Oh well, at least I can watch my other favorite show tonight, Reviver .”  Again, not a real show, though it sounds like S urvivor , which is a real show.  Victor says, “Sorry, but Reviver  been preempted.”  “To preempt” (preempt) means to replace something with something  else, especially something more important.  On television, for examp le, if the president is going to be giving an important speech, sometimes they will preempt shows; they will not show them and replace them with, for example, the p resident’s speech, and that’s what is happening in our dialogue.  “The pre sident is giving a televised speech tonight.”  “Televised” means shown on TV.

Cleo says, “Are you kidding me?!” meaning are you j oking with me.  Victor says, “Nope,” which is an informal way of saying “no” – “ nope” (nope).  If you want to say “yes” the informal phrase would be “yup” (yup),  but “nope” I think is a little more common.  Anyway, Victor says, “Nope, sorry.”  Cleo says, “The world is conspiring against me.”  “To conspire against (some one)” is when you have many people working, trying to harm another person in some way, or trying to make life difficult for you.  Of course, no one is actually conspiring against Cleo. It’s an expression we sometimes use as a joke to say that everything is going wrong, as if someone were trying to hurt you or har m you.

Cleo says, “I’ve had enough.  I’m giving up TV watc hing!”  “To give up” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to stop doing something t hat you normally like to do. “I’m going to give up smoking.”  I’m going to stop smoking cigarettes.  Actually I don’t smoke, it’s just an example.  “I’m going to g ive up Earl Grey tea lattes at Starbucks.”  No, I’m just kidding.  I’m not going t o give up my Earl Grey tea lattes!

Victor says, “You?” meaning you’re going to give up  TV, “That I’ve got to see!” The expression “that I’ve got to see” means that yo u don’t believe the person. You think that what they said or just promised to d o won’t happen, you don’t believe them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cleo:  The new TV season is starting this week and I can’t wait.  I’ve been watching reruns all summer and I’m ready for the pr emiers of my favorite shows.

Victor:  You watch Madwomen , right?

Cleo:  Yes, it’s my favorite show.

# Things Associated with Autumn

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 723: Things Associated with Autumn.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 723.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Things Associated with Autu mn,” or fall, the season that in the United States comes between the months of, say,  September and December. We’re going to talk about vocabulary – things that we would talk about or relate to the fall or autumn.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Erin:  Smell that!

Sean:  Smell what?

Erin:  Can’t you smell the changing of the seasons?   I love autumn.  The fall colors are out and there’s a chill is in the air.

Sean:  That means I’ll be raking leaves every weeke nd when I should be watching football.

Erin:  How can you be so grumpy when you see cute l ittle squirrels squirreling away their nuts for the winter?

Sean:  That just means they’re running across the r oof even more often, waking me up every morning.

Erin:  Not even you can put a damper on my good moo d.  I can’t wait for homecoming games and especially the harvest festiva ls.  They’ll be hayrides, bonfires, and s’mores!

Sean:  As you know, I have hay allergies and those bonfires are a danger to the environment.  And I don’t like s’mores, in the summ er or in the fall.

Erin:  How can you be such a party-pooper?

Sean:  The only good thing about the fall is that it’s right before winter when bears go into hibernation, so I won’t have to worry  about running into one.  Hey, what’s this?

Erin:  This is a cup of hot chocolate to put you in  the fall mood.  Drink up and we’ll go for a walk outside.  It’s a beautiful day and a walk will help you see all that you’re missing.

Sean:  I’ll drink the hot chocolate, but don’t expe ct any epiphanies.

[end of dialogue]

Erin begins by saying to Sean, “Smell that!”  Sean says, “Smell what?”  Erin says, “Can’t you smell the changing of the seasons? ”  The “seasons” are the four periods of the year: summer, spring, fall, and wint er.  The “changing of the seasons” is when we go from one season to another.  Erin says, “Can’t you smell the changing of the seasons?  I love autumn.”  “Aut umn” is another word for fall. Erin says, “The fall colors are out and there’s a c hill is in the air.”  “Fall colors” refer to the leaves on the trees that in many parts  of the country – in the U.S. – change colors in the fall as the leaves begin to di e and fall to the ground during winter.  Autumn is full of fall colors in the north eastern and midwestern parts of the U.S., and also in parts of California.  When I was growing up, you could drive out into the country or along one of Minnesota’s ri vers and see the beautiful orange and yellow of the trees as the leaves change d or turned colors.  So, that’s what fall colors refer to.  A “chill” is a low temp erature, when it isn’t warm out.  It isn’t freezing, it’s somewhat between warm and free zing, but on the cold side, so a little cold.

Sean says, “That means I’ll be raking leaves every weekend when I should be watching football.”  “To rake (rake) leaves” means to collect the leaves that fall off of the trees, to collect them from your lawn – the grass in front or behind your house – to collect them all together and to either put them in a bag to get rid of them or some people use them as part of their ferti lizing process, to put them back into the ground after treating them somehow.  When I was a child, sometimes we would burn the leaves, put them all in  one big pile and burn them. They don’t do that very much anymore; it’s not safe  and it also causes a certain amount of smoke pollution.  But, that’s what it mea ns to rake leaves.  There’s a noun, “rake,” which refers to the tool, the thing t hat you use.  It’s sort of like a broom, and you use it to move the leaves to put the m all into one place.  So, “to

rake,” as a verb, means to use that plastic or meta l tool to clean off the leaves, if you will, from your lawn or grass.

Erin is excited about the autumn coming.  Sean, how ever, sees the negative side, that he will have to rake leaves instead of w atching American football, which traditionally is played in the fall and early  winter.

Erin says, “How can you be so grumpy when you see c ute little squirrels squirreling away their nuts for the winter?”  “To b e grumpy” (grumpy) means to be annoyed, angry; not really mad, just sort of neg ative about things.  Not being nice to other people, perhaps being overly sensitiv e to other people’s remarks, that’s grumpy.  It might be the way a wife describe s her husband when he is not in a good mood, when he isn’t feeling well for exam ple.  Erin says that there are little squirrels squirreling away their nuts for the winter.  A “squirrel” is a small animal that likes to climb trees and eat nuts and s eeds.  I grew up in Minnesota, where there are lots of squirrels.  “To squirrel aw ay” as a verb means to save, to store for later, to keep for the future.  The idea is that that’s what squirrels do; they gather food for the wintertime.  “To squirrel away” means to save for something; to “save up,” we might say.

Sean says, “That just means they (the squirrels) are running across the roof even more, waking me up in the morning.”  He’s saying th at because the squirrels are going to be so active trying to save food for the w intertime, they will be running on top of his house and he will get woken up in the  morning because of it.  I have squirrels that climb on the top of my house all the  time, and you can hear their little feet as they run across the roof.

Erin says, “Not even you can put a damper on my goo d mood.”  “To put a damper (damper) on (something)” means to lessen or reduce someone’s interest or enthusiasm or excitement.  “The heavy storm put a damper on the outside party.”  It lessened people’s enthusiasm for someth ing.  Erin says that not even Sean and his grumpy mood can put a damper on her go od mood.  The word “damper,” along with the word “chill,” has some oth er meanings in English.  Take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ex planations of those.

Erin says, “I can’t wait for homecoming games and e specially the harvest festivals.”  A “homecoming game” is an event in a h igh school or at a university typically in the fall, that includes some sort of s ports game and usually a dance or some sort of party.  The word “homecoming” comes fr om “come home.”  In this case, former students, people who used to go to a s chool, are invited back on homecoming day or homecoming weekend to go to the s ports game, often an American football game, and then to a party – altho ugh usually they don’t go to

the parties, that’s just for the current students.  Homecoming is a big event in most American high schools and in many American col leges and universities. There are dances; there are all sorts of things ass ociated with that custom.

A “harvest festival” celebrates the time when farme rs go out into the fields and get the food that has grown during the summertime; we call that the “harvest.” “To harvest,” as a verb, means to go out and collec t the food – the corn, the wheat, other food that you are growing and bring it  in, and it is popular in many places.  Again, I can speak mostly from my own expe rience in the Midwest there are lots of harvest festivals in the fall, in Septe mber and October, celebrating the end of the growing season and, of course, giving th anks, was the original idea, for the food that one has received or one has taken  from the fields from were the food grows.

She says, “They’ll be hayrides, bonfires, and s’mor es!”  A hayride” (hayride) is when you sit on a long, flat trailer that’s being p ulled by either some sort of farm machinery, like a tractor, or horses, and it’s basi cally a form of entertainment. You go for a little ride out into the countryside o r into the farm.  We used to go on hayrides when I was a child.  We would go out away from the city and you could have a hayride.  Usually it was organized by some s ort of group, and everybody paid a small amount of money to go on this hayride.   “Bonfires” (bonfires) are large fires outdoors.  You remember I mentioned abo ut burning the leaves when I was a child.  Well, if you did that outdoors, out i n the field somewhere, we might call that a “bonfire” if it’s a large fire.  It’s a  controlled fire.  It’s not just burning everything around, it’s in one specific small area.   “S’mores” (s’mores) is a kind of dessert made in the summertime and in the fall with  marshmallows, a piece of chocolate, and two crackers, what we call “graham c rackers.”  It’s like a little chocolate and marshmallow sandwich.  It sounds disg usting – doesn’t sound very good, but it tastes okay.

Sean says, “As you know, I have hay allergies and t hose bonfires are a danger to the environment.  And I don’t like s’mores, in the summer or in the fall.” “Allergies” is a physical condition, where you have  a reaction to certain substances.  It could be some parts of a flower, it  could be a type of food; some people have food allergies to peanuts for example.  He, Sean, has hay allergies, what we more commonly would call “hay fever,” even though it isn’t a fever; you don’t have a high temperature like you would normal ly in a fever.  Sean says the “bonfires are a danger to the environment,” because  of all the smoke, which is why in many places you can no longer have a bonfire  – in the United States, anyway.

Erin says, “How can you be such a party-pooper?”  A  “party-pooper” (pooper) is a person who ruins other people’s fun, someone who’s negative, who doesn’t participate, or doesn’t want anyone else to have fu n at a party or some celebration.

Sean says, “The only good thing about the fall is t hat it’s right before winter when bears go into hibernation.”  “Hibernation” is a lon g period of time when animals, like bears, sleep, usually during the coldest part of the year.  Sean says because the bears are in hibernation he won’t have to worry  about running into one; that is, unexpectedly finding one, which of course might  be dangerous.  Then he says, “Hey, what’s this?”  Erin says, “This is a cu p of hot chocolate to put you in the fall mood.”  “Hot chocolate” is liquid, usually  water or milk mixed with chocolate and heated up.  She says, “Drink up (mean ing drink it all) and we’ll go for a walk outside.  It’s a beautiful day and a wal k will help you see all that you are missing.”  Sean says, “I’ll drink the hot choco late, but don’t expect any epiphanies.”  An “epiphany” (epiphany) is when you have a sudden understanding of something, an experience that some how makes you understand something that you never understood befo re.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Erin:  Smell that!

Sean:  Smell what?

Erin:  Can’t you smell the changing of the seasons?   I love autumn.  The fall colors are out and there’s a chill is in the air.

Sean:  That means I’ll be raking leaves every weeke nd when I should be watching football.

Erin:  How can you be so grumpy when you see cute l ittle squirrels squirreling away their nuts for the winter?

Sean:  That just means they’re running across the r oof even more often, waking me up every morning.

Erin:  Not even you can put a damper on my good moo d.  I can’t wait for homecoming games and especially the harvest festiva ls.  They’ll be hayrides, bonfires, and s’mores!

 Sean:  As you know, I have hay allergies and those bonfires are a danger to the environment.  And I don’t like s’mores, in the summ er or in the fall.

Erin:  How can you be such a party-pooper?

Sean:  The only good thing about the fall is that it’s right before winter when bears go into hibernation, so I won’t have to worry  about running into one.  Hey, what’s this?

Erin:  This is a cup of hot chocolate to put you in  the fall mood.  Drink up and we’ll go for a walk outside.  It’s a beautiful day and a walk will help you see all that you’re missing.

Sean:  I’ll drink the hot chocolate, but don’t expe ct any epiphanies.

# Being Impolite in Conversation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 724: Being Impolite in Conversation.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 724.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode, like all of our current episodes, has  a Learning Guide that will help you understand it much better.  Go to eslpod.com, b ecome a member of ESL Podcast, and download the Learning Guide.

This episode is called “Being Impolite in Conversat ion.”  It’s a dialogue between Angela and Ronny talking about someone who is not v ery nice when they are having a conversation with someone else.  Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Angela:  Ugh!  I hate talking to Rebecca.  Every ti me I ask her a question, she ignores me or sneers at me.

Ronny:  Are you sure it’s not your imagination?  Sh e’s perfectly nice to me.

Angela:  It’s not my imagination.  When I try to te ll her something, she cuts me off.  When I try to explain something to her, she’s  short with me or talks over me. I always get the feeling that she’s looking down he r nose at me.

Ronny:  Maybe she feels threatened by you.

Angela:  How so?

Ronny:  You’re younger, smarter, and better educate d.  She might feel like you’re after her job.

Angela:  But I’m not!  I just started here and I do n’t have any designs on replacing her.

Ronny:  And you’re prettier than she is.

Angela:  What does that have to do with anything, e ven if it were true?

Ronny:  Well, she’s had a thing for me for a while and…

Angela:  And she thinks I’m her competition.  No wo nder she’s so standoffish with me.  I’ll just make it clear that I won’t stan d in her way.

Ronny:  You won’t?

Angela:  Huh?

Ronny:  Never mind.

[end of dialogue]

Angela begins by saying to Ronny, “Ugh!  I hate tal king to Rebecca.  Every time I ask her a question, she ignores me or sneers at me. ”  “To ignore (someone)” is not to pay attention to them, not to talk to them o r even act as if they are there with you.  “To sneer” (sneer) means to smile in a m ean way, or to make an expression with your face – with your mouth that in dicates that you are being mean or unkind.

Ronny says, “Are you sure it’s not your imagination ?”  “Imagination” is our ability to invent new things in our mind, to think of new t hings.  Ronny is asking if perhaps Angela is imagining what Rebecca is doing, meaning Rebecca isn’t really doing it, it’s just Angela who thinks she is .  Ronny says, “She (Rebecca) is perfectly nice to me.”  “Perfectly,” here, is used to emphasize what you are saying, especially when something is in doubt or is  in question.  “Perfect” has a number of meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more of those.

Angela says, “It’s not my imagination.  When I tell  her something, she cuts me off.”  “To cut (someone) off” is a phrasal verb mea ning to interrupt someone, to start speaking before they are finished speaking.  We use this expression, “to cut (someone) off,” in conversation; we also use it, pe rhaps a little more commonly, in driving.  To cut someone off when you are drivin g is to drive right in front of them, to go from one lane to another and cause them  to have to slow down because you have gone right front of their car, or you have come very close to their car, too close for safety.  That’s to cut som eone off on the freeway or on a road.  It happens every day here in Los Angeles, an d in every city where there are cars I would guess.

Angela says, “When I try to explain something to he r, she’s short with me or talks over me.”  Not only does Rebecca cut her off – inte rrupt her conversation, when

Angela is trying to explain something to Rebecca, “ she is short with me.”  “To be short with (someone)” means to give very short answ ers that seem unfriendly. Someone says to you, “So, how was your weekend?” an d you say, “Fine.”  And they say, “Oh.  Tell me what you did?” and you say,  “Nothing.”  That would be, perhaps, being short with someone, or saying someth ing in a way that is slightly angry – that you are angry at that person or upset.   “To talk over (someone)” means to talk while the other person is still talki ng.  “To cut (someone) off” means to interrupt them, to make them stop talking so tha t you can talk.  “To talk over (someone)” is to talk often at a higher volume – lo uder – while that person is still talking.  You’re trying to get them to stop talking , but if they don’t stop talking you just continue talking yourself; you talk over them.   This happens on political discussion shows on television all the time now in the United States, something that became popular about, oh, 30 years ago I would  guess, and now everyone talks over everyone else.  And of course, if you are talking and the other person is talking, there’s nobody listening!

Angela says, “I always get the feeling (I always th ink) that she’s looking down her nose at me.”  “To look down your nose at (someone)”  means to think that you are better than the other person, to think that you are  superior to another person. Ronny says, “Maybe she (Rebecca) feels threatened b y you.”  “To feel threatened by (someone)” in this case means to feel  challenged, as though someone wants to remove you or replace you.  This c ould be especially true if the person you are talking to is your boss or someo ne above you in position in the company.  If they feel threatened by you, they think that maybe you will come and take their job or their position.

Angela says to Ronny’s statement, “How so?”  “How s o?” is a question meaning please give me more examples of what you are talkin g about, or give me more information.  When you don’t understand what someon e is saying, and you want them to tell you more you might use this question.  You may hear someone say, for example, “That is a terrible grocery store,” an d you say, “How so?”  And they say, “Well, they don’t have any good fruit.  The me at department never has enough chicken.  The people there are not friendly. ”  Those are reasons why it is such a bad grocery store.  So, “How so?” tells the person to do give you more information.

Ronny then gives Angela more information about why he thinks Rebecca feels threatened by her.  He says, “You (Angela) are youn ger, smarter, and better educated.  She might feel like you’re after her job .”  “To be after (something)” means to want to get it, to try to do something to get something.  “He is after his best friend’s girlfriend.”  He wants to get the gir lfriend to be his girlfriend, kind of like that song in the 1980s by The Cars: “She’s my best friend’s girlfriend / And

she used to be mine.”  That’s a little different st ory; see, it used to be his girlfriend, and now the girlfriend is the girlfrien d of his best friend.  Not really a good situation I think, if you want to stay friends  with someone!

Anyway, we’re talking about Angela and Rebecca.  Re becca feels threatened by Angela because, Ronny says, Angela is smarter, youn ger, and better educated. Angela says she’s not after Rebecca’s job.  She say s, “I just started here and I don’t have any designs on replacing her.”  “To have  designs on (something)” means to plan to do or get something, often by doing something secret or dishonest – not honest.  “I have designs on my best  friend’s girlfriend.”  I want to try to get her away from him, and I’m going to do s omething tricky or secret to make that happen.

Ronny says, “And you’re prettier than she is.”  Tha t is, Angela is prettier than Rebecca.  Angela says, “What does that have to do w ith anything, even if it were true?” meaning why is that important that I may be prettier than she is.  Ronny says, “Well, she’s had a thing for me for a while a nd…”  “To have a thing for (someone)” means to be interested in someone romant ically.  “I have a thing for my best friend’s girlfriend.”  See, we keep coming back to that example!  So, that’s one reason why Rebecca doesn’t like Angela, because Angela is prettier, and Rebecca likes Ronny and Rebecca thinks that Ron ny will become interested in Angela instead of in her.

Angela understands now.  She says, “And she (Rebecc a) thinks I’m her competition,” meaning the two of them are trying to  get Ronny, and Angela is going to compete against Rebecca.  She’s going to f ight against Rebecca, if you will, to get Ronny.  Angela then says, “No wonder ( meaning it is no surprise, it is not surprising) she’s so standoffish with me.”  “To  be standoffish” (standoffish – one word) means to be very unfriendly, to be very f ormal with someone when you should be, perhaps, informal and friendly with them.  “To be standoffish” means to be not very welcoming of another person.

Angela says, “I’ll just make it clear (that is, I’l l explain to Rebecca clearly) that I won’t stand in her way.”  “To stand in (someone’s) way” means to prevent them from doing something, to try to stop them from doing something.  Angela is going to tell Rebecca that she, Angela, will not stand in  her way, meaning she is not going to try to get Ronny interested in her romanti cally.

Ronny says, “You won’t?”  Ronny, of course, is surp rised; he wants Angela to be interested in him, obviously.  Angela says, “Huh?”  She doesn’t understand. When we don’t understand something, an informal way  of expressing that is with the following sound: “Huh?” spelled (huh).  Ronny s ays, “Never mind.”  “Never

mind” is a phrase we use when someone doesn’t want to repeat or explain something he has just said, either because it isn’t  very important or because you think the other person won’t understand it.  Ronny is disappointed when he finds out that Angela isn’t really romantically intereste d in him, so when Angela doesn’t understand what Ronny is really saying, he says, “N ever mind.”  He doesn’t want to explain it to her; of course, that would be some what embarrassing to Ronny.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Angela:  Ugh!  I hate talking to Rebecca.  Every ti me I ask her a question, she ignores me or sneers at me.

Ronny:  Are you sure it’s not your imagination?  Sh e’s perfectly nice to me.

Angela:  It’s not my imagination.  When I try to te ll her something, she cuts me off.  When I try to explain something to her, she’s  short with me or talks over me. I always get the feeling she’s looking down her nos e at me.

Ronny:  Maybe she feels threatened by you.

Angela:  How so?

Ronny:  You’re younger, smarter, and better educate d.  She might feel like you’re after her job.

# Childhood Illnesses and Diseases

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 725: Childhood Illnesses and Diseases.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 725.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there today and beco me a member of ESL Podcast.  The world will be a happier place if you do!

This episode is on the always-happy topic of childh ood illnesses and diseases. We’re going to talk about the names of some common illnesses and diseases that, unfortunately, children sometimes get.  Let’s  get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rebecca:  You look exhausted!  Another tough day at  the daycare center?

Puneet:  Yeah, it was.  This is a record year for t he kids getting sick.  The chicken pox is going around.  Last year, it was the  measles.  The year before that, it was the mumps.  This year, it’s the chicke n pox.

Rebecca:  You sent the kids home, right?

Puneet:  Yeah, but today, a couple of the kids look ed like they have pink eye, and I had to call their parents to let them know.

Rebecca:  What happened to simple nosebleeds and ea raches?

Puneet:  Oh, we have kids with those, too, but it’s  the contagious diseases that really take its toll.  I’m not sure, but I think on e of the little kids has strep throat, and a couple of the really little kids have croup.  I wish there were a way to immunize all of them from every illness and disease  out there.

Rebecca:  Are you sure you’re working in a daycare center?

Puneet:  Yeah, why?

Rebecca:  Because it just sounds like you’re workin g at the Center for Disease Control.  Tomorrow, I suggest wearing a gas mask to  work.

 [end of dialogue]

Rebecca begins by saying to Puneet, “You look exhau sted (meaning you look very tired)!  Another tough day at the daycare cent er (another difficult day at the daycare center)?”  “Daycare centers” are places whe re you can take young children, and they will take care of them for you d uring the day – pretty logical. Daycare is usually something provided for children who are not yet old enough to go to school, so anyone from being a baby to, say, five or six years old, although some programs also have after school care, where yo u can take a child after they finish school.  However for the most part, day care is for men and women who work during the day and need someone to watch t heir young children.

Puneet says, “Yes, it was (it was a tough day).  Th is is a record year for the kids getting sick.”  A “record year” is a year where you  have the highest level or highest amount of something, a year with more of so mething than any other year. So if you said, “This is a record year for rainfall ,” for the amount of rain that has fallen from the sky in this area, that means that no other year has had as much rain as this year.  “Record” has a couple of differ ent meanings in English; you can find those in our wonderful Learning Guide.

Puneet says the kids are getting sick this year mor e than any other year, so it’s a record year.  “The chicken pox is going around.”  “ Chicken pox” (pox) is an infection that is easily shared among children, and  sometimes among adults.  It is a disease that can give you a fever – a high temper ature, it causes you to be tired, and more importantly, it produces small, lit tle red spots or marks on your skin that are “itchy,” meaning you want to take you r fingers and move them back and forth over them, what we would call “scratch” t hem.  That’s chicken pox; it’s a very common disease – illness among children.  I ha d chicken pox.  I think you can get chicken pox typically just once, and I cert ainly remember having it when I was a young child.  When we say something is “going  around,” we mean that many different people seem to be getting this illne ss or this sickness.  We could talk about the flu is going around – influenza; man y people are getting sick from it.  In this case, “The chicken pox is going around .  Last year, it was the measles,” meaning last year the disease that was po pular, that was going around among the children was measles.  “Measles” (measles ), which I believe the more technical name would be rubeola; it’s a disease tha t also causes fever – high temperature, as well as coughing, red eyes, and lik e chicken pox, many red spots on the skin.  I’m not sure if I had measles w hen I was young; I don’t think so.  I don’t remember; it was so many years ago.

So, Puneet says that last year the popular disease was measles, “The year before that, it was the mumps” (mumps).  The “mumps ” is another disease that causes pain in your what we call “salivary glands.”   It’s the part of the body that produces liquid inside of your mouth.  So you often  have pain near your ears, and it’s technically an “inflammation.”  That is, it causes it to grow – to swell. Although I’m not a real doctor, so if I’m not descr ibing these perfectly, and you’re a doctor, please don’t email and say, “Jeff, no, ac tually it’s…” – well, you get the idea, right?  It’s not fun, the mumps.  Did I have the mumps?  I don’t remember; you’ll have to ask my mother!

Puneet says, “This year, it’s the chicken pox.”  Re becca says, “You sent the kids home, right?” meaning the children could not stay a t the daycare if they were sick, because then other kids would get sick.  Pune et said, “Yeah (meaning yes, I did send them home), but today, a couple of kids (t wo or three) looked like they have pink eye, and I had to call their parents to l et them know.”  “Pink eye” is another disease – another illness that can be caugh t from one person to another, what we would say a “contagious” disease.  Its tech nical name is conjunctivitis, and it is an infection on the white part of your ey e; your eye actually becomes pink, and it can be quite painful as well.

Rebecca says, “What happened to the simple noseblee ds and earaches?”  A “nosebleed” is when blood comes out of your nose an d you can’t stop it quickly; usually it just lasts for a few minutes.  If you hi t your nose you might get a nosebleed.  “Earaches” are when you have pain in yo ur ears.  Nosebleeds and earaches are not serious illnesses; they’re not ser ious medical problems.  They are something that children often get, and that’s w hy Rebecca is saying, “What happened to simple nosebleeds and earaches?”  She’s  really saying it used to be kids would only get simple problems, and now it see ms the problems are getting worse.  That’s sort of the idea of her question.

Puneet says, “Oh, we have kids with those, too, but  it’s the contagious diseases that really take its toll (or that really take thei r toll).”  “Contagious” means, as I mentioned earlier, that it is easy for the disease to go from one person to another.  A “disease” is just another name for an i llness or a sickness.  When we say something is “taking its toll,” we mean that it  is having a negative impact on something; it is having a bad effect on something.  Puneet says, “I’m not sure, but I think one of the little kids has strep throat .”  “Strep (strep) throat” is when you have an infection in your throat that makes it very painful.  I had strep throat more than once when I was a child, I’m pretty sure.   In any case, I was a very sickly child.  You see, I…I was always sick it seem s.  No, not really, just my memory I think.  You remember the bad things more t han the good things sometimes, right?

 Anyway, Puneet says, “a couple of the really little  kids have croup” (croup). “Croup” is a more serious illness that makes it dif ficult for young children to breathe and makes them cough a lot.  Puneet says, “ I wish there were a way to immunize all of them from every illness and disease  out there.”  “To immunize” (immunize) means to protect someone from getting a disease by either giving them a shot of a drug or having them swallow someth ing that helps their body fight against those diseases if they are exposed to  them – if they come in contact with them.  Immunizations are very important for ch ildhood health.  Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, there are still many pare nts who do not immunize their children.  That’s dangerous to their children; it’s  dangerous to other children, but we won’t talk about that here.

Rebecca says, “Are you sure you’re working in a day care center?”  Puneet says, “Yeah, why?”  Rebecca says, “Because it just sounds  like you’re working for the Center for Disease Control.”  The Center for Diseas e Control is a U.S. government organization or agency whose job it is t o investigate diseases and educate people how to prevent them.  It’s located i n Atlanta, Georgia, and most people know it simply by the initials, the CDC.  Re becca says, “Tomorrow, I suggest wearing a gas mask to work.”  A “gas mask” (mask) is something that you wear over your mouth and nose, sometimes your e yes, to allow you to breathe even though you have been exposed to danger ous chemicals in the air. In World War I, when both sides in the war in Europ e used gas to try to kill or hurt the other side, many of the soldiers would have gas  masks to protect themselves so they could breathe without getting sick from the  poisonous gas.  Of course, Rebecca is making something of a joke here, saying that the place – the daycare center where Puneet works is so dangerous maybe he should wear a gas mask to work tomorrow.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rebecca:  You look exhausted!  Another tough day at  the daycare center?

Puneet:  Yeah, it was.  This is a record year for t he kids getting sick.  The chicken pox is going around.  Last year, it was the  measles.  The year before that, it was the mumps.  This year, it’s the chicke n pox.

Rebecca:  You sent the kids home, right?

This episode is called “Taking the Driving Test,” a bout taking a test to get your driver’s license for a car.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cesar:  I just took the driving test.  See this?  T hat’s my new license.

May:  You have to give me the play-by-play.  I’m ta king the test next week and I’m freaking out.

Cesar:  There’s nothing to worry about.  It was eas y.

May:  I’m not worried about the written test.  It’s  the driving test I’m worried about. I haven’t had a lot of practice.  What did you have  to do?

Cesar:  Well, we got into the car and I fastened my  seat belt.  The examiner had me drive around the block, checking to see that I s topped at the stop signs and traffic signals.

May:  That sounds okay.  Did you have to drive on t he freeway?

Cesar:  Yeah, I went on the onramp and merged into traffic.  She had me change lanes and accelerate to pass another driver.  Just don’t forget to signal and don’t go over the speed limit.

May:  Did you have to parallel park?  That’s what I ’m most worried about.

Cesar:  Yeah, I parallel parked, but it was easy.  Why are you so worried about the test?

 May:  I told you.  I haven’t had very much practice .

Cesar:  Exactly how many times have you been behind  the wheel?

May:  Well, a few times…maybe two times, and that w as around a parking lot.

Cesar:  Wow, you’d better get more practice if you’ re going to take the test next week.

May:  Could you…?

Cesar:  Uh, sorry, but I’ve got someplace to be.

[end of dialogue]

We begin with Cesar saying to May, “I just took the  driving test,” meaning I took the test recently.  A “driving test” is an examinat ion that you have to take in order to get your driving license.  In most U.S. states, you need to take two exams or two tests.  One is written; these are questions abo ut the rules of the road, the laws of driving in that state.  Each state has slig htly different laws, but they’re basically the same.  The second test is what we cal l a “behind the wheel test,” where you actually have to go out with someone who gives you your score.  You have to do certain thing driving on the street, and  if you do everything correct then you get your license – or most things correct.   If you don’t hit another car or kill anyone, then you’ll probably get your license in most places.  Cesar just took his driving test; we assume it’s the behind the whe el test.  He says, “See this? That’s my new license.”  That’s his legal permissio n to drive, that’s what a “license” is.  “License” has some other meanings in  English; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.

May says, “You have to give me the play-by-play.”  “Play-by-play” is a detailed description of what happened.  In a sports game you  have different plays – different parts of the game.  Each little part of t he game can be called a “play,” and on the television or radio the person who descr ibes everything that is happening in the game is giving the play-by-play, a  detailed description.  We use the expression more generally, outside of the sport s world, to mean a detailed description of something that happened.

May says, “I’m taking the test (the driving test) n ext week and I’m freaking out.” “To freak (freak) out” is a two-word phrasal verb u sed informally to mean get very worried or nervous about something, so much that it  is controlling all of your

thoughts and emotions.  Cesar says, “There’s nothin g to worry about.  It was easy.”  May says, “I’m not worried about the writte n test.  It’s the driving test I’m worried about.”  So here, “driving test” refers to I called before the “behind the wheel test.”  Why do we call it “behind the wheel”?   Well, we are talking about the round wheel that you use to direct the car, what we  would say “to steer” the car; in fact, it’s called a “steering wheel.”  So, “behi nd the wheel” means you are sitting there with the wheel in front of you, which  means you are actually in the car driving.

Anyway, poor May is freaking out; she’s worried abo ut the driving test or the behind the wheel driving test.  She says, “I haven’ t had a lot of practice.  What did you have to do?”  Describe what you had to do.  Cesar says, “Well, we got into the car and I fastened my seat belt.”  So he a nd the person – we would call him or her the “examiner,” probably – got into the car and the first thing Cesar did was fasten his seat belt.  The “seat belt” is a lon g piece of material – of fabric – that goes across your chest and your waist to keep you in your seat.  You wear a seat belt on an airplane when you are taking off – leaving, or landing – coming down onto the ground.  You wear a seat belt in a ca r.  In most states, perhaps in all of them, you are required to wear a seat belt.  If you don’t wear a seat belt you can be fined; you will have to pay money if the pol ice see you not wearing a seat belt.  It’s also, of course, just common sense; it’ s good for your safety to wear a seat belt.  So Cesar fastened his seat belt.  “To f asten” (fasten) usually means to connect two things together so that they will stay together.  You are usually fastening things that can also easily come apart.  We usually use it when we are talking about rope or, in this case, a seat belt, w hich is a long, narrow piece of material.  “The examiner had me drive around the bl ock, checking to see that I stopped at the stop signs and traffic signals.”  In  a city, a “block” is a square area surrounded by four crossing streets.

Cesar drove around the block so the examiner could check to see that he stopped at the stop signs and traffic signals.  A “ stop sign” is, in the United States, a red, eight-sided sign with the word “STOP ” in white letters.  That’s a stop sign; it tells you you must stop before going forward.  A “traffic signal” – sometimes called a “semaphore,” only by me I think – means a box with three lights – one is red, one is yellow, one is green – that tells you if you need to stop, that’s the red color, of course.  If you can go, th at’s the green color, or if you need to prepare to stop, which would be the yellow color .  Well, we have traffic signals usually where two streets cross, what we would call  an “intersection,” where they come at right angles to each other.  Sometimes you can have a traffic signal in front of what’s called a “pedestrian crossing,” whe re people are allowed to walk across the street.  That could be in the middle of a long block, and that might also

have a traffic signal in some places.  But usually a traffic signal would be at an intersection, where two streets cross.

May says, “That sounds okay.  Did you have to drive  on the freeway?”  The “freeway” is a wide road, with usually more than tw o “lanes,” two places where the cars can drive, and they drive very quickly wit hout stopping.  Cesar says, “Yeah, I went on the onramp and merged into traffic .”  The “onramp” (one word) is a little road that leads from the street to the freeway; it’s how you get on a freeway.  The opposite would be an “offramp.”  Cesa r says that he had to merge into traffic.  “To merge” (merge) is when two lanes  of traffic have to come together, so you have to either go in front of the car near you or behind the car that is near you.  Cesar says that the examiner had  him change lanes and accelerate to pass another driver.  “To change lane s” means to move your car from one lane on a freeway or on a street to anothe r, but going in the same direction.  “To accelerate” means to drive faster, to increase your speed.  Then Cesar gives May some advice, “Just don’t forget to signal and don’t go over the speed limit.”  “To signal” (signal) here means to u se the lights of your car to indicate that you are going to move into another la ne or you are going to turn onto another street.  You have a right signal and a  left signal in most cars.  The “speed limit” is the maximum allowed speed on a roa d.  In the United States for a freeway in the city it’s usually 55 or 65 miles per  hour; out in the country, away from the big cities, it can be as high as 70 or 75 miles an hour.  The word “signal,” I should mention, has some other meanings  in English.  You can find those in the Learning Guide.

May says, “Did you have to parallel park?”  “To par allel park” means to park your car between two other cars, where you have to back your car up – go in reverse in order to get into a parking space in between two  other cars.  That’s often a very difficult thing for a beginning driver to do.  May says, “That’s what I’m most worried about.”  Cesar says, “Yeah, I parallel park ed, but it was easy.  Why are you so worried about the test?”  May says, “I told you.  I haven’t had very much practice.”  Cesar says, “Exactly how many times hav e you been behind the wheel?”  That is, how many times have you been out driving?  May says, “Well, a few times…maybe two times, and that was around a pa rking lot,” a place where you park your car.  Cesar says, “Wow, you’d better get more practice if you’re going to take the test next week,” meaning you have  to go and drive more so that you are ready to take the driving test.  May says, “Could you…?”  She doesn’t finish her question, but she seems to be asking Ces ar if Cesar would take her out driving to give her some practice.  That, of course , is a difficult thing to do since the beginning driver doesn’t always know what they are doing and it can be a little dangerous for the person driving, as well as  you.  In the United States, if you pass the written test you can then practice behind the wheel with someone who

has a driver’s license, who, the idea is will help you, tell you what to do and not to do.  Cesar says, “Uh, sorry, but I’ve got someplace  to be.”  The expression “I’ve got someplace to be” is a phrase you use to tell the person that you are busy, you have another appointment, but you don’t give th em any details.  We often use this when we are lying and simply don’t want to  do what the other person is asking us to do.  You may say, for example, “Can yo u watch my dog and cat while I’m on vacation?” and I will say, “Oh, I’m so rry.  I’ve got someplace to be for the next two weeks.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cesar:  I just took the driving test.  See this?  T hat’s my new license.

May:  You have to give me the play-by-play.  I’m ta king the test next week and I’m freaking out.

Cesar:  There’s nothing to worry about.  It was eas y.

May:  I’m not worried about the written test.  It’s  the driving test I’m worried about. I haven’t had a lot of practice.  What did you have  to do?

Cesar:  Well, we got into the car and I fastened my  seat belt.  The examiner had me drive around the block, checking to see that I s topped at the stop signs and the traffic signals.

May:  Could you…?

Cesar:  Uh, sorry, but I’ve got someplace to be.

This episode is a dialogue between Ralph and Nina a bout architectural styles; that is, the look, the design of houses, how they l ook inside and outside.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ralph:  I just talked to our new real estate agent and she’s going to show us some houses tomorrow.  I told her that the bigger t he better and that we’re looking for a large Cape Cod or Georgian-style hous e.

Nina:  You did?  I’ve been thinking that we’d try t o find something more modest, a bungalow or a cottage.

Ralph:  What?!  You think I’m going to live in a ho use that’s a step up from a mobile home?  No way.  We’ve come into some money a nd we’re going to buy a big house – maybe a colonial or a Greek revival.

Nina:  If you want something bigger than a bungalow , how about a split-level modern house or maybe a ranch-style house?

Ralph:  You’re still thinking too small.  The sky’s  the limit.  We can afford something big, something really big.

Nina:  That’s what the nouveau riche would do.

Ralph:  So what?  Our money is new and we have a lo t of it, and I want a big house.  We’re not being ostentatious.  If anyone cr iticizes us for that, I’d say, “Deal with it!”

[end of dialogue]

 Our dialogue begins with Ralph saying to Nina, “I j ust talked to our new real estate agent and she’s going to show us some homes tomorrow.”  “Real estate” (two words) refers to property – physical property – land and buildings including houses.  An “agent” is someone who sells or buys or  negotiates for you.  A “real estate agent” is someone that helps you either buy or sell your house.  Ralph says that he told the real estate agent the bigger the better; that is, he’s looking for a big house.  When we say “the bigger the bette r” we mean the larger something is the better it is.  That’s not always t rue, but that’s what Ralph wants in his new house.

He says, “we’re looking for a large Cape Cod or Geo rgian-style house.”  A “Cape Cod” is a type of home that originally was very pop ular in a certain area in the United States, an area in the state of Massachusett s, which is in the northeast part of the U.S.  Cape Cod, if you look at a map of  the state of Massachusetts, is the thin, you might even call it a “tail” that come s out from the main part of Massachusetts into the Atlantic Ocean.  It’s like a  little...hmm...a little “c” that comes out, that’s called Cape Cod.  A Cape Cod-styl e house usually has one or two floors – two levels, the roof comes to a point,  and there’s often, or usually, a chimney in the center of the house.  A “chimney” is  a tall structure that you use for a fireplace.  When you have a fire with wood or  gas in one of your rooms you need some place for the smoke to go, and it goes up  something called a “chimney.”  So that’s a Cape Cod-style house.  A “G eorgian- (Georgian) style house” is a large, rectangular house, usually two o r three floors, with a door in the center, and many identical rectangular windows that are on each floor.  It’s what we might call a very “symmetrical” looking hou se.  There are windows on both sides and they match, and the distance between  them matches, and so forth.  That’s a Georgian-style house.

Nina says, “You did (meaning you told her we wanted  a big house)?  I’ve been thinking that we’d try to find something more modes t, a bungalow or a cottage.” “Modest” (modest) usually means humble, someone or something without a lot of money.  “Modest” can have a couple of different mea nings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  B ut when we use it to describe, for example, a house, we would mean it’s not a large house, not an expensive looking house.

A “bungalow” (bungalow) is a very small house, usua lly with just one level – one floor.  It has a roof; there’s often a open area in  the front that has a cover on it, what we would call a “porch” (porch).  Many houses in the U.S. have porches. Our house, when I was growing up in Minnesota, had a porch.  It was an “enclosed porch,” meaning there were windows and a door even though it was

outside of the house; it wasn’t heated in the winte rtime.  A “bungalow” is a small, very small little house.  This style of house was v ery popular in California, especially in the 20 th century.  Near where I live, not too far from Santa  Monica, California, there are lots of little bungalows that  you can still find.  Many of them have been destroyed, we would say “torn down,” and replaced by larger houses, but there are still a fair number – a reasonable nu mber of them here in Southern California.

A “cottage” (cottage) is also a small house, usuall y with only one or two bedrooms, and one floor.  Often there are many othe r identical looking houses called “cottages” near it.  Usually, the word “cott age” is used for a small house that is near a lake or perhaps a river, although it  might be in the mountains as well.  Cottages are usually used as vacation housin g; that is, somewhere where you go on the weekend, not the place where you live  the entire year.  The word “cottage” is not as common in California; you will hear the word more often in the Midwest and the East, where there are more lakes an d rivers and perhaps more of these kinds of houses.

Nina, then, wants a smaller house than Ralph.  Ralp h says, “What?!  You think I’m going to live in a house that’s a step up from a mobile home?  No way.”  So, Ralph is saying that he does not want to live in a house that is just a step up from a mobile home.  The expression “to be a step up fro m” means one level higher, slightly better than, an improvement over.  A “mobi le home” is the cheapest, least expensive kind of housing you can have.  It’s a hom e that is made like a big trailer; there are wheels on it, and it is towed by  a truck and put into the place where you are living.  Often there are other mobile  homes very close to you, what we would call a “mobile home park.”  Mobile homes a re housing for people, often times, who don’t have a lot of money; they are chea p housing.  Ralph says that he is not going to live in a house that is just a l ittle better, just a step up from a mobile home.  He says, “We’ve come into some money and we’re going to buy a big house.”  “To come into some money” means to rec eive some money, usually from someone who has died.  We would call that “inh eriting” the money (inheriting).

Well, Ralph and Nina have inherited some money, and  Ralph wants to buy a big house.  “Maybe,” he says, “a colonial or a Greek re vival.”  A “colonial” is a home built in one of the styles that was popular in the United States before we became a country, when we were still a colony.  That’s whe re “colonial” comes from. Usually, a colonial has one or two stories – one or  two floors – two levels, and very steep roofs; that is, roofs that come to a ver y sharp angle.  That’s a colonial house, especially on the East Coast and the Midwest  in the U.S.  Here in the west, especially California, we have something call ed a “Spanish colonial,” which

is different than a eastern colonial house.  A Span ish colonial has usually rounded arches in the side of the house and in the windows.  It is not as sharp; it doesn’t have as many angles.  Even the walls in the  corner of the – of the room are rounded in many Spanish colonial houses.  You f ind a lot of those here in Los Angeles that were built in the early and mid-20 th  century.  “Greek revival” is a house or a building that looks likes sort of classi c ancient Greek architecture, with what we would call “pillars,” large, round columns in the front around the building. Many of the buildings in Washington, D.C. for the U .S. government are built in this sort of classic Greek style.  So, a Greek revi val house would be one like that.

Nina says, “If you want something bigger than a bun galow, how about a split- level modern house or perhaps a ranch-style house?”   A “split-level home” is a home where you walk in and there are two more level s, they’re sort of halfway between being a completely separate level.  One lev el above you is where there are bedrooms, and one level below you is where you will find, say, the living room, the main space in the house.  That’s a split- level house.  A “ranch-style house” is a long, rectangular house, with only one floor.  It has very large windows.  It’s very plain, very simple, not a lot of decoration inside or outside the house.

Ralph says, “You’re still thinking too small.  The sky’s the limit.”  The expression “the sky is the limit” – we put “sky” and “is” toge ther so it becomes “the sky’s the limit” – is a phrase used to show there are no limi ts, no controls.  You can have whatever you want, as expensive and as big as you want.  Ralph says, “We can afford (meaning we have the money for) something bi g, really big.”

Nina says, “That’s what the nouveau riche would do. ”  “Nouveau riche” is a French expression.  And by the way, I always mispro nounce the French expressions; I’m sorry.  Please don’t email me and tell me I’m saying it wrong.  I know I’m saying it wrong.  It’s...uh...just because  I’m not very intelligent; I haven’t figured out French pronunciation yet.  In fact, I m ispronounce all languages really!  Um...so, that’s...uh...that’s what America ns do!  We’re not the smartest people, you have to understand that.  Or maybe it’s  just me!  Anyway, “nouveau riche” in U.S. English means someone who has become  rich, someone who has become wealthy very recently.  The term is often us ed as a criticism, as a negative way of describing people who suddenly get a lot of money and go out and spend a lot of money on things that other peopl e disapprove of, or that show that they have a lot of money.

Ralph says, “So what?  Our money is new and we have  a lot of it, and I want a big house.  We’re not being ostentatious.”  “To be ostentatious” (ostentatious) means to do something or say something just to impr ess other people, especially

when you spend a lot of money.  Rock stars and cele brities are often ostentatious; they like to spend their money on big  cars or jewelry to show other people how much money they have.  Ralph says, “If a nyone criticizes us, I’d say, ‘Deal with it!’”  The expression “deal with it” is an informal expression, slightly rude.  It’s used to tell people that you must accep t or learn to tolerate something because it’s not going to change.  Someone is compl aining about their life; you might, if you are tired of listening to them, say, “Oh, just deal with it!” meaning you just have to make the best of it that you can.  You’re really telling them to stop complaining.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ralph:  I just talked to our new real estate agent and she’s going to show us some houses tomorrow.  I told her that the bigger t he better and that we’re looking for a large Cape Cod or Georgian-style hous e.

Nina:  You did?  I’ve been thinking that we’d try t o find something more modest, a bungalow or a cottage.

Ralph:  What?!  You think I’m going to live in a ho use that’s a step up from a mobile home?  No way.  We’ve come into some money a nd we’re going to buy a big house – maybe a colonial or a Greek revival.

# Describing One¡¦s Skill Level

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 728: Describing One’s Skill Level.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 728.  Can you believe it?!  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, C alifornia.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  Why?  Well, we wa nt you to become a member of ESL Podcast, my friend, and be able to download the Learning Guide for this episode, which will make your life much easier and happier.

This episode is a dialogue between Elaine and Tony,  using vocabulary to describe how good you are at doing something.  Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Elaine:  Welcome to your first day as an intern in our company office.  Let me show you around.  This is the main office area with  a cubicle for each employee. Are you pretty good with computers?

Tony:  Actually, my computer knowledge is pretty ba sic.  The only thing I’m adept at is videogames.  I’m not up to snuff on actually doing work on one.

Elaine:  Okay, well you should be proficient by the  end of your internship.  Over there is where we keep the photocopier and fax mach ine.  Have you used them before?

Tony:  I’m an expert on the copier.  I can use it w ith one hand tied behind my back.  I’m particularly good at photocopying body p arts.

Elaine:  Uh, great.

Tony:  But the fax…I’ve only used one once and I ne ver quite mastered it.

Elaine:  I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it pretty quickly.  And this is the break room.  You have your standard refrigerator and vend ing machines.

Tony:  Hey, I’m really good with vending machines.  That’s one machine I know inside and out.

Elaine:  How could I have guessed that the one thin g you really excel at is working the vending machine?

[end of dialogue]

Elaine says to Tony, “Welcome to your first day as an intern in our company office.”  An “intern” (intern) is a person, usually  a student, who works in an organization for a short period of time – a month, two months, maybe a year – to learn how to do something and to prepare for their future doing that kind of job. Lots of organizations have interns; they are young students, either still in college or just graduated from college, that perform differ ent jobs.  Sometimes they are paid, sometimes they are volunteer; you don’t get p aid but you do get experience.  I think I need an intern here at the C enter for Educational Development.  You know, someone to bring my coffee in the morning – or my tea, as the case may be.  Well, Elaine is welcoming  – is saying hello to Tony, who is an intern.  She says, “Let me show you aroun d.”  Let me give you a tour; let me tell you where everything is.  She then says , “This is the main office area with a cubicle for each employee.”  A “cubicle” (cu bicle) is a small work area within a larger office space.  Typically, it has a desk, a computer, a telephone. There are walls around it, but the walls don’t go a ll the way up to the ceiling. That’s a cubicle.

Elaine then asks Tony, “Are you pretty good with co mputers?”  Tony says, “Actually, my computer knowledge is pretty basic.”  When we say our knowledge about something is “basic,” we mean that it isn’t v ery much; it’s the minimum that you need to know; you could be much, much better; it’s very low, very beginning level.  “Basic” has a number of different meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more of those.  Tony says, “The only thing I’m adept at is videogames.”  “To be adept (adept) at (something)” means to be able to do something very well, to be very good at doing or using something. “He’s adept at certain programming languages,” Java  and PHP – I don’t know – something you’re good at.  Tony says he’s adept at videogames, but “I’m not up to snuff on actually doing work on one.”  “To be up  to snuff” (snuff) means to perform at a satisfactory level, to meet someone’s expectations, to be good enough to do something.  I am up to snuff on record ing podcasts; I’m able to do it.  I can’t do a lot of other things, but I am up to snuff on the recording part anyway.

Elaine says, “Okay, well you should be proficient b y the end of your internship.” Your “internship” is the time that you are an inter n.  “To be proficient” (proficient) means to be good at something, to be very good at it.  You might be an expert or you might just have a lot of knowledge, but you are  very good at what you do.

We often talk about proficiency in languages, being  able to speak them and understand them and so forth.  Elaine says, “Over t here is where we keep (where we have) the photocopier and the fax machine.”  A “ photocopier,” more commonly called a “copying machine” or just a “copi er,” is a machine that produces an image on a piece of paper from what you  give it.  So it sort of takes the image and reproduces it onto a piece of paper; that’s a copying machine.  A “fax machine” is a machine that uses phone lines to  send images of paper to another machine – another fax or fax machine.  Fax machines are becoming less and less common now, with the Internet and email.

Tony says, “I’m an expert on the copier.”  “To be a n expert” means to be someone who knows almost everything about something .  You could be an expert on ancient Greek art or an expert on how to fix your car.  Tony is an expert on copying machines.  He says, “I can use it  with one hand tied behind my back.”  The expression “to have one hand tied behin d your back” means you can do something very easily, without any difficulty.  To tie your hand would be to take a piece of rope or string so that you couldn’t  move your hand.  If you tied it behind your back, you could only do something with one hand – with one arm. The idea is that you’re so good you don’t need both  arms – both hands to do it. Tony, again, is making a little bit of a joke here.   He says, “I’m particularly good at (I’m very good at) photocopying body parts.”  A “bo dy part” is a part of your body: your arm, your leg, your hand, and so forth.  Somet imes in offices as a joke people will take pictures of their head or other pa rts of their body and give them to someone as a joke.  So Tony is an intern who’s m aking a joke.  Elaine is not really happy with this joke; she says, “Uh, great.”   She doesn’t really mean “great,” she says it in a way that makes us underst and that she doesn’t really think the joke is very funny.

Tony says, “But the fax…I’ve only used one once and  I never quite mastered it.” “To master (something)” is to become very good at s omething; it’s to become an expert.  Elaine says, “I’m sure you’ll get the hang  of it pretty quickly.”  “To get the hang (hang) of (something)” means to learn how to d o something, to learn how to do something correctly.  She says, “this is the bre ak room.”  A “break room” is a room in an office where you can go to eat, to relax .  Many employees get a break – a 15 minute break every morning and every afterno on in addition to their, say, 30 minute lunch break, and this is where you can go  in the building.  It usually has chairs and tables, sometimes machines that sell  things: candy and soda, coffee, etc.  Elaine says, “You have your standard refrigerator (your normal refrigerator) and vending machines.”  We just expla ined a “vending machine,” it’s a machine that you put money into and it gives you food or drink or other things.

Tony says, “Hey, I’m really good with vending machi nes.”  I know how to use them very well; again, another joke.  He says, “Tha t’s one machine I know inside and out.”  “To know (something) inside and out” mea ns to know it very well, to have knowledge of all the different parts of someth ing.  Elaine says, “How could I have guessed that the one thing you really excel at  is working the vending machine?”  The first part of this question, “how co uld I have guessed,” means it should have been obvious.  It’s a kind of a strange  expression, but what she’s saying is it is obvious, knowing you – or knowing w hat I do about you, that in this case you really excel at working with the vending m achine.  “To excel” (excel), as a verb, means to do something very well, to become a master at doing something.  We have the adjective “excellent,” whic h is related.  Elaine says that Tony really excels at working the vending machine, meaning using the vending machine.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Elaine:  Welcome to your first day as an intern in our company office.  Let me show you around.  This is the main office area with  a cubicle for each employee. Are you pretty good with computers?

Tony:  Actually, my computer knowledge is pretty ba sic.  The only thing I’m adept at is videogames.  I’m not up to snuff on actually doing work on one.

Elaine:  Okay, well you should be proficient by the  end of your internship.  Over there is where we keep the photocopier and fax mach ine.  Have you used them before?

Tony:  I’m an expert on the copier.  I can use it w ith one hand tied behind my back.  I’m particularly good at photocopying body p arts.

Elaine:  Uh, great.

Tony:  But the fax…I’ve only used one once and I ne ver quite mastered it.

Elaine:  I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it pretty quickly.  And this is the break room.  We have your standard refrigerator and vendi ng machines.

Tony:  Hey, I’m really good with vending machines.  That’s one machine I know inside and out.

Elaine:  How could I have guessed that the one thin g you really excel at is working the vending machine?

# Being Blunt and Stubborn

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 729: Being Blunt and Stubborn.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 729.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This podcast has a website, and the website is eslp od.com.  Go there to become a member and download the Learning Guide for this e pisode.  All of the cool kids are doing it!

This episode is a dialogue between Simone and Dirk about people who are perhaps a little more direct – a little more honest  than you would want them to be.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Simone:  So, what did you think of Bruce?  Isn’t he  great?

Dirk:  Well, he’s certainly direct and forthright w ith his opinions.  I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who speaks his mind the way he does .

Simone:  Yeah, isn’t that great?  I’ve never liked a guy who straddles the fence or has namby-pamby opinions.  I’ve always liked guys w ith strong opinions.

Dirk:  Well, there’s strong and there’s pigheadedne ss.  Don’t you think?

Simone:  What?!  You think Bruce is pigheaded, just  because he doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him?  I think that’s an admirable trait.

Dirk:  I think being blunt can be admirable under t he right circumstances, but being stubborn as a mule can make it hard on other people, don’t you think?

Simone:  No, I don’t.  Other people can pull their punches if they want to, but a man who’ll speak up about what he believes in and s tand by it is a real man to me.

Dirk:  I can see why you two make a perfect couple.   I hope never to be on the wrong side of an argument with either one of you.

[end of dialogue]

Simone begins by saying to Dirk, “So, what do you t hink of Bruce?” meaning what is your opinion of Bruce.  “Isn’t he great?”  Isn’t he wonderful?  Dirk says, “Well, he’s certainly direct and forthright in his opinions.”  “To be direct” here means to give your opinion without trying to be nic e to the other person; you tell them exactly what you are thinking even if it might  hurt them a little.  “Direct” has several meanings in English however; take a look at  our Learning Guide for some more of those.  “To be forthright” (forthright  – one word) is the same as “direct.”  To be “outspoken” or “bold” are other sy nonyms – other words similar to this word of “forthright.”  He says, “I don’t think  I’ve ever met anyone who speaks his mind the way he does.”  “To speak your mind” is  an expression that means to share your opinion even if other people have a diff erent opinion.  I speak my mind on the podcast sometimes.  The idea is usually  that maybe some people disagree with you, about cats or my neighbors’ chil dren for example.

Simone says, “Yeah, isn’t that great?  I’ve never l iked a guy who straddles the fence or has namby-pamby opinions.”  “To straddle ( straddle) the fence” is an expression that means to be indecisive, not to be a ble to decide what you want or what you believe because you’re able to see the pluses and minuses – the advantages and disadvantages of both sides.  So, yo u don’t make up your mind; you don’t give your opinion because you’re not quit e sure.  Simone says that she doesn’t like guys – men – who straddle the fence; s he doesn’t like men who have namby-pamby opinions, either.  “Namby (namby) -pamb y (pamby)” means not to be able to make a clear decision, to be indecisive.   It’s definitely a negative way of describing someone who doesn’t make a decision, who sits back and says, “Well, maybe yes, maybe no.”  “To straddle the fenc e” is more neutral; that is, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re criticizing the per son.  But “namby-pamby” – and those two words are not used in any other conte xt in English that I know – “namby-pamby” is definitely a negative way to descr ibe someone.

Simone says, “I’ve always liked guys with strong op inions.”  Dirk says, “Well, there’s strong and then there’s pigheadedness.”  We ll there’s a couple of things going on in that expression, or that sentence.  Dir k says that there is something called “pigheadedness.”  This is a long word, all o ne word: “pig…headed…ness.” “To be pigheaded” means to not change your opinion,  to be stubborn.  You won’t change your opinion no matter what other people say .  We can describe someone as being pigheaded, and that is definitely a negative way to describe them.  Why pigs?  I don’t know, but that’s the expr ession.  So, “pigheadedness” is the state of or the condition of being stubborn.   Dirk says, “there’s strong and there’s pigheadedness.”  We might more commonly say , “there’s strong and then there’s pigheadedness.”  That construction – that s tructure of “there’s

(something) and then there’s (something else)” is u sed to emphasize how one word seems to be okay but the second word – the sec ond concept is definitely negative.  So being strong, in your opinion, that’s  okay.  But being pigheaded, that’s not okay.  Another example: “There’s dieting  and then there’s anorexia.” “To diet” means not to eat food because you are try ing to lose weight.  “Anorexia” is a disease that causes you to not want to eat, an d that can be very dangerous to your health; it can make you sick, it can even k ill you.  So, the first term is positive or neutral, the second one is negative.  T here’s something and then there’s something else, and the something else is a lways negative.  So Dirk says, “there’s strong and then there’s pigheadednes s.  Don’t you think?”

Simone says, “What?!  You think Bruce is pigheaded,  just because he doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him?”  Simone i s obviously upset by Dirk’s comment.  She says that he isn’t pigheaded just he doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him.  “To budge” (budge) means t o move when you are pushed.  In this case, it means to change your opin ion when you get new information; someone tells you something and you ch ange your mind.  But if someone tells you something and you still do not ch ange your mind we might say that you won’t budge, you won’t change your opinion .  “To sway” (sway) here means to persuade or convince someone to consider a nother idea or to have a different opinion – to change someone’s opinion.  S imone says that Bruce doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him – t ry to change his opinion. She thinks that that is an admirable trait.  Someth ing that is “admirable” is something you admire.  That’s where the word comes from; (admire) is the verb, “admire.”  “Admirable” is the adjective, someone wh o you have a high opinion of, who you respect.  A “trait” (trait) is a characteri stic, a feature, an aspect of someone’s personality, the way someone acts.  You c ould say that he is an honest person or he is a confident person or he is a generous person, he gives his money to other people who need it.  Those are t raits, for most people admirable traits.

Dirk says, “I think being blunt can be admirable un der the right circumstances, but being stubborn as a mule can make it hard on ot her people, don’t you think?” Dirk is defending himself here.  He’s saying that b eing blunt – that is, being direct – is okay.  It’s okay to be forthright, direct, blu nt, but to be stubborn as a mule can make it hard on other people.  A “mule” (mule) is the offspring – is the child – of a horse and a donkey.  They are used as animals usually for transporting or moving things or pulling things.  Well, the idea is  that mules are stubborn, like donkeys are stubborn; they don’t change their mind,  they don’t like to be moved. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but that’s the expression.  So, “to be stubborn as a mule” means to be very stubborn, not to want to c hange your mind ever.  Dirk

says that that can make it hard on other people; it  can be difficult when you are working with other people.

Simone does not agree.  She says, “Other people can  pull their punches if they want to, but a man who’ll speak up about what he be lieves in and stands by it is a real man to me.”  “To pull your punches” means no t to be as forceful as you could.  Someone who could be more powerful or more forceful could perhaps damage someone else or hurt someone else more, but they decide not to.  The expression comes from boxing.  “Boxing” is a sport where two people – usually men, who try to hit each other with their fists – w ith their hands and their arms.  A “punch” is when you actually hit another person wit h your fist, which is your hand closed up tight.  “To pull your punches” would be n ot to hit as hard as you could; that’s where the expression, I believe, comes from.   Simone says that other people may do that, but she wants a man who will speak up about what he believes in.  “To speak up” is a two-word phrasal v erb to meaning to say your opinion even when it is unpopular or no one wants t o hear it.  Simone says that Bruce, who I guess is her boyfriend or someone she perhaps wants to be her boyfriend, speaks up about what he believes in and stands by it.  “To stand by (something or someone)” means to be committed to it , to continue to believe in something or someone even when they are unpopular, even when things are going badly for them.  Simone says that Bruce stand s by his opinions; he doesn’t change them because they are unpopular.

Dirk says, “I can see why you two make a perfect co uple.”  That is, why you are a good match, a good pair of people to be together.  “I hope never to be on the wrong side of an argument with either one of you.”  “To be on the wrong side of an argument” means to disagree with another person,  to have an argument with another person.  Normally when we say you’re on the  wrong side of something, means that you’re wrong or that you are in a positi on or a situation that will probably lose – that will not be the winning situat ion.  You may talk about someone being on the wrong side of history, meaning  they’re supporting an opinion or an idea that in many years people will c onsider wrong, for example.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Simone:  So, what did you think of Bruce?  Isn’t he  great?

Dirk:  Well, he’s certainly direct and forthright w ith his opinions.  I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who speaks his mind the way he does .

Simone:  Yeah, isn’t that great?  I’ve never liked a guy who straddles the fence or has namby-pamby opinions.  I’ve always liked guys w ith strong opinions.

Dirk:  Well, there’s strong and there’s pigheadedne ss.  Don’t you think?

Simone:  What?!  You think Bruce is pigheaded, just  because he doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him?  I think that’s an admirable trait.

Dirk:  I think being blunt can be admirable under t he right circumstances, but being stubborn as a mule can make it hard on other people, don’t you think?

Simone:  No, I don’t.  Other people can pull their punches if they want to, but a man who’ll speak up about what he believes in and s tand by it is a real man to me.

Dirk:  I can see why you two make a perfect couple.   I hope never to be on the wrong side of an argument with either one of you.

# Waiting For Exam Results

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 730: Waiting for Exam Results.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 730.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  Download this epi sode’s Learning Guide, an 8- to 10-page guide we provide for all of our current episodes.

This episode is a dialogue between Joel and Susanne .  They’re talking about a school test, an exam that they took, and waiting for the results of that exam to see if they passed it or not.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Joel:  Did it come?

Susanne:  No, it’s not in today’s mail.  Why do I b other, anyway?  I know it’s a foregone conclusion.  I’ve failed.

Joel:  That’s bull!  I know you passed.  You’re jus t on tenterhooks waiting around for the results to arrive and you’re psyching yourself out.

Susanne:  No, I’m not.

Joel:  Don’t you remember that when you came home a fter taking the exam, you thought you had aced it?

Susanne:  I did, but that was before I started thin king about all of the questions I got wrong.  Then, I thought it was a toss up whethe r I passed or not.  Now that I’ve had even more time to think about it, I’m sure  I biffed it.

Joel:  See what I mean?  You’ve been psyching yourself out for weeks.  You studied really hard and I have no doubt that you pa ssed with flying colors.  All right, you’re not going to hear today, so let’s get  your mind off of the exam, okay?

Susanne:  All right.  How?

Joel:  You can help me  study for the exam.  I’m taking it at the next administration.  I have no intention of bombing it or even squeaking by by the skin of my teeth – like some people.

Susanne:  Very funny.  Okay, so maybe I’m psyching myself out – a little bit. Okay, I’m game.  Where do we begin?

Joel:  With all of the ones you thought you got wro ng.

Susanne:  What?!

Joel:  There’s no sense wasting all that worrying.  And if you did fail it, you’ll need to get ready to take it again.

Susanne:  Gee, thanks!

[end of dialogue]

Joel begins by saying, “Did it come?” meaning did s omething arrive.  We’re not sure what it is, but we find out a little bit later .  Susanne says, “No, it’s not in today’s mail (the mail that arrived today).  Why do  I bother, anyway (meaning why do I worry about it)?  It’s a foregone conclusi on.  I’ve failed.”  A “foregone conclusion” is a result that is certain to happen o r an expected result.  “The team from Albert Lee High School has won the championshi p every year for 10 years, so this year’s result is a foregone conclusion,” me aning it’s obvious Albert Lee High School will win again.  Well, the foregone con clusion that Susanne believes is true is that she has failed.  “To fail” means to  be unsuccessful in an examination, a test, or an interview, when you don’ t pass.  “To fail” is the opposite of “passing.”

Joel says, “That’s bull!” (bull).  “Bull” is a poli te, shorter way of saying a vulgar expression.  The full expression is “bull (shit),” but that’s not a very nice thing to say, so sometimes in more polite conversation we ju st say “bull.”  If somebody says something to you and you think it’s wrong or t hey’re lying or it’s nonsense, you’ll say, “Oh, that’s bull.”  It’s kind of strong  however.  You would never that in a formal conversation – never say it to your boss i f you still want your job!  Joel says, “I know you passed (you were successful).  Yo u’re just on tenterhooks waiting around for the results to arrive and you’re  psyching yourself out.”  “To be on tenterhooks” (tenterhooks – one word) means to b e in suspense about what will happen in the future; to feel nervous or conce rned about something that will happen.

Joel says that Susanne is on tenterhooks because sh e is waiting around; she is waiting for the results of her exam to arrive and s he’s psyching herself out.  “To psych (psych) yourself out” is a two-word phrasal v erb meaning to prepare yourself mentally for something that is going to ha ppen, usually something that is difficult or unpleasant.  “To psych yourself out” u sually means that you are thinking about it, and because of the way you are t hinking about it you will fail; you will not do well.  You can psych someone else o ut; you can say things to them that will make them think about a situation or  a problem or a game that will cause them to lose because of what you said.  This is different than “to be psyched.”  “To be psyched” means to be prepared, to  be thinking about something but looking forward to it, happy about it .  There’s a third expression, “to be psyched up,” which is similar to the express ion “to be psyched.”  “To be psyched up” means to be ready for something.  But, “to be psyched out” usually means that you are thinking negatively, and because  of that will not succeed.

Susanne says, “No, I’m not,” I’m not psyching mysel f out.  Joel says, “Don’t you remember that when you came home after the exam, yo u thought you had aced it?”  “To ace (ace) (something)” usually means to p ass an exam or a test by getting an excellent score, perhaps even a perfect score.  I very rarely aced exams when I was in school!  Susanne says, “I did ( I did think that I aced the exam), but that was before I started thinking about  all of the questions I got wrong.  Then, I thought it was a toss up whether I passed or not.”  A “toss up” is a situation in which all of the possibilities are e qually likely to happen.  A “toss up” is when you can’t decide, when there are different possibilities, and they all look good.  “Toss” has a couple of different meanings in  English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Susanne says that she then thought it was a toss up  whether she passed or not; she couldn’t decide.  “Now that I’ve had even more time to think about it, I’m sure I biffed it.”  “To biff” (biff) means to do very po orly, to do a poor job at something. “I biffed the exam” means I failed it; I didn’t do very well.  “To biff” can also mean to fall or to fail at some sort of sporting event o r sporting activity.  “The hockey player skated down the ice and biffed,” he fell.  T hat’s another use of that word. Both ideas are similar; they relate to failure, whe n you biff.  “He approached a beautiful woman at the bar, but he biffed when he s tarted talking to her.”  That could mean that he fell down or it could mean that he failed.  And if he fell down, well, he definitely failed!  Not a good way to impr ess a beautiful woman to fall down in front of her.

Well, back to our story.  Susanne says that she’s s ure she biffed her exam.  Joel says, “See what I mean?  You’ve been psyching yourself out for weeks.  You studied really hard and I have no doubt (meaning I’ m absolutely sure) that you

passed with flying colors.”  “To pass with flying c olors” means to receive a high score on the test, to do very well.  “All right,” J oel says, “you’re not going to hear today, so let’s get your mind off of the exam, okay ?”  “To get your mind off of (something)” means to stop thinking about something  that you are worried about or that you are, we would say, “obsessing over,” th inking about constantly, over and over and over again, like when you biffed talki ng to the beautiful girl at the bar!

So, Susanne says, “All right.  How?”  How are we go ing to get my mind off of the exam?  Joel says, “You can help me  study for the exam.  I’m taking it at the next administration.”  An “administration” of an exam is  an opportunity to take the examination – to take the test.  If you want to go to college in the United States, you often have to take the Scholastic Aptitude – I guess they call it Scholastic Achievement Test, the SAT.  Or if you study at a co llege and you’re from another country, you may have to take the TOEFL exam, Test of English as a Foreign Language.  There are many different administrations  of these exams; they give them in different places at different times.

Joel says, “I have no intention of bombing it or ev en squeaking by by the skin of my teeth – like some people.”  “To bomb (bomb) (som ething)” means to get a very low score on something, usually an exam or a t est, to clearly fail.  It could be, however, you clearly fail something else, like that girl at the bar: “I bombed when I tried talking to her.”  Your friend says, “H ow did it go?”  “Oh, I bombed,” I did terribly.  “Bomb” has a number of meanings in E nglish, however.  Some of them – not all of them – some of them are in the Le arning Guide.

Joel says that he is not going to squeak by.  “To s queak by” means to pass an exam or pass some sort of challenge but just barely , by a very small amount.  To do something “by the skin of your teeth” means some thing similar to do it but just barely, to be successful by a very small amount.  J oel combines these two similar ideas by saying “to squeak by by the skin of his te eth.”

So, Susanne says, “Very funny,” because Joel is say ing that that’s what Susanne did.  She says, “Okay, so maybe I’m psyching myself  out – a little bit.  Okay, I’m game.  Where do we begin?”  “To be game” means to b e willing to try something or do something, especially something that may be a  little risky or that you have never done before.  “I’m game” means I’m willing to  do it.  Susanne says, “Where do we begin?”  And Joel says, “With all of the ones  you thought you got wrong,” meaning he wants to go over all of the questions th at Susanne thinks she got wrong on the exam.  Of course, this is not a very g ood way to get Susanne’s mind off of the exam, which is what Joel is suppose d to be doing.

Susanne can’t believe what Joel is saying; she says , “What?!  Joel says, “There’s no sense wasting all that worrying.”  The expressio n “there’s no sense” means there is no reason to, or it is useless to.  “There ’s no sense talking to her, she is already married.”  Well, Joel says, “There’s no sen se wasting all that worrying,” meaning since Susanne has been worrying about the e xam, she should try to do something constructive with it – something useful w ith it.  Joel says, “And if you did fail it (if you did fail the exam), you’ll need  to get ready to take it again.” Susanne then says, “Gee, thanks!”  But she says it a way that means the opposite.  “Gee, thanks” is what we say when someon e tells us something that they think may be useful but we know is not.  For e xample: “Well, you don’t have a date tonight.  But at least you can watch basebal l on television.”  You might say, “Gee, thanks!” meaning it’s not really the sam e; it’s not as good as having a date tonight.  Although for me, I would probably pr efer to watch baseball!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Joel:  Did it come?

Susanne:  No, it’s not in today’s mail.  Why do I b other, anyway?  I know it’s a foregone conclusion.  I’ve failed.

Joel:  That’s bull!  I know you passed.  You’re jus t on tenterhooks waiting around for the results to arrive and you’re psyching yourself out.

Susanne:  No, I’m not.

Joel:  Don’t you remember that when you came home a fter taking the exam, you thought you had aced it?

Susanne:  I did, but that was before I started thin king about all of the questions I got wrong.  Then, I thought it was a toss up whethe r I passed or not.  Now that I’ve had even more time to think about it, I’m sure  I biffed it.

This episode is a dialogue between Roberta and John  about vocabulary related to “innuendo,” when we indirectly communicate meani ng to other people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roberta:  You know, my birthday is coming up.

John:  Yeah, I know.  What are you getting at?

Roberta:  Nothing.  I was just thinking that it’s k ind of an important birthday, a major birthday.

John:  Yes, I know.  Spit it out.  What are you dri ving at?

Roberta:  I was just thinking that some people migh t not know what to get me for such an important birthday, since some people don’t  like to put a lot of thought into presents.

John:  What are you implying?  Are you insinuating that I don’t get you good presents for your birthdays?

Roberta:  No, of course not.  I just don’t want you  to have to rack your brain to think of the perfect gift, that’s all.

John:  Just tell me.  What should I get you for you r very important birthday?

Roberta:  What?  Just blurt it out?  I can’t do tha t.  I can give you a hint, but since you love me so much, I’m sure you can read my mind.

John:  That’s where you’re wrong.  If I had a nicke l for every time a woman thought I should be able to read her mind, I’d be t he richest man in the world!  I don’t have an inkling of what you have on your mind .

Roberta:  All right, I’ll make it more than a hint.   I’ll give you three clues.

John:  Great.  That’ll make things crystal clear.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Roberta saying to John, “You know, my birthday is coming up.”  Something that is “coming up” is somet hing that will be happening in the near future, something that will occur soon.  J ohn says, “Yeah, I know.  What are you getting at?”  “To get at” is to say somethi ng indirectly, to communicate something to another person without saying it direc tly.  You’re suggesting something.  Roberta says, “Nothing (she’s not getti ng at anything).  I was just thinking that it’s kind of an important birthday, a  major birthday.”  John says, “Yes, I know.  Spit it out.”  “Spit (spit) it out” is an expression that means say something quickly, stop trying to hide it.  It’s of ten used when someone will talk about something that is embarrassing or difficult, or perhaps critical of the other person.  But when you say “spit it out,” you’re say ing to the person just say it now, directly.  John says, “What are you driving at ?”  “To drive at” means the same as “to get at,” to say indirectly.

Roberta says, “I was just thinking that some people  might not know what to get me for such an important birthday, since some peopl e don’t like to put a lot of thought into presents.”  “Some people,” if you noti ce the way Roberta says it, is a way that we say something about another person with out using their name. We’re really saying “you,” but you’re trying to be polite or perhaps funny by just putting it in this neutral third person – or in thi s case, third people – “some people.”  “Some people (meaning you) might not know  what to get me for such an important birthday, since some people (you, John ) don’t like to put a lot of thought into presents (or gifts).”  “To put a lot of thought into (something)” is to think about something seriously for a long time, gi ve it a lot of thought, a lot of serious considering before making a decision.

John says, “What are you implying?”  “To imply” (im ply) means to strongly suggest something without saying it directly.  Well , John is asking what Roberta is implying.  He says, “Are you insinuating that I don’t get you good presents for your birthdays?”  “To insinuate” (insinuate) means to suggest that something is bad, something is wrong, without saying it directly .  It’s similar to “imply,” but it always has a negative connotation; something bad is  being implied.

 Roberta says, “No, of course not (of course she was n’t insinuating that John gives her bad presents for her birthdays).  I just don’t want you to have to rack your brain to think of the perfect gift, that’s all .”  So, Roberta is saying these things to help John, that’s what she says.  She doe sn’t want John to rack (rack) his brain.  “To rack your brain” means to put a lot  of thought into something, to take a long time to think of something.  We also us e this if we’re having difficulty remembering something or someone.  “I’m racking my brain trying to think of the name of the girl who sat next me in social studies class when I was a senior in high school.”  I think her first name was Linda…Lyd ia…I can’t remember. Anyway, that’s what racking your brain is, trying t o think of something, spending a lot of time and energy doing it.

So Roberta says she’s trying to help John, and John  says, “Just tell me.  What should I get you for your very important birthday?”   Roberta says, “What?  Just blurt it out?”  “To blurt (blurt) (something) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to say something without first thinking carefully about wh at you are saying or how you will say it.  Sometimes people say things, and then  they realize that it was a mistake to tell someone something.  Maybe they’re n ervous, maybe they’re excited; they blurt something out, they say somethi ng they shouldn’t.

Roberta says that she doesn’t really want to blurt it out, to tell John directly.  She says, “I can’t do that.  I can give you a hint, but  since you love me so much, I’m sure you can read my mind.”  A “hint” (hint) is a s mall piece of information that suggests something else.  It’s a clue; it’s to help  you guess something or figure something else out.  “To read someone’s mind” means  to know what the other person is thinking.  So Roberta is saying here that  she can give John a clue – a hint, but because John loves her so much he should be able to read her mind. Now, this is something that many women believe abou t men – wives about their husbands, girlfriends about their boyfriends – that  because they love them they should know what they want for their birthday.  But  of course, we men know this isn’t true!

John says, “That’s where you’re wrong.  If I had a nickel for every time a woman thought I should be able to read her mind, I’d be t he richest man in the world!” This phrase, “if I had a nickel (which is five cent s) for every time something happens, I’d be rich,” the idea is that this has ha ppened to you many, many times.  If each time it happened you got a very sma ll amount, say a nickel, which is five American cents, you would be rich because it has happened to you so many times.  You could say “if I had a dollar” or “ if I had a quarter.”  It has to be a small amount of money.  John is saying that many wo men in his life have thought that he should be able to read their minds.  He say s, “I don’t have an inkling of

what you have on your mind.”  An “inkling” (inkling ) is a little bit of knowledge, a small idea; you know a little bit, but not very muc h.  John says he doesn’t have an inkling.  He doesn’t have any idea what is on Ro berta’s mind, what she’s thinking, what she wants for her birthday.

Roberta says, “All right, I’ll make it more than a hint.  I’ll give you three clues.”  A “clue” (clue) is a piece of information that helps you solve a problem, usually when there’s some sort of crime or mystery involved .  Roberta’s going to give John three clues to what she wants to have for her birthday.  Notice we say “clues to (something).”  You have clues to the gift , in this case.

John says, “Great.  That’ll make things crystal cle ar.”  The expression “crystal (crystal) clear” means easy to understand, no doubt  about something.  It’s obvious almost; you know exactly what it is.  That’ s something that is crystal clear.  “The professor gave crystal clear definitio ns about what he was talking about,” they were easy to understand.  We’re not su re here if John is being sarcastic, if he’s making a joke, because of course  a clue is not the same as the actual answer to the problem.  But we hope John wil l buy the right gift and figure it out!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Roberta:  You know, my birthday is coming up.

John:  Yeah, I know.  What are you getting at?

Roberta:  Nothing.  I was just thinking that it’s k ind of an important birthday, a major birthday.

John:  Yes, I know.  Spit it out.  What are you dri ving at?

Roberta:  I was just thinking that some people migh t not know what to get me for such an important birthday, since some people don’t  like to put a lot of thought into presents.

John:  What are you implying?  Are you insinuating that I don’t get you good presents for your birthdays?

Roberta:  No, of course not.  I just don’t want you  to have to rack your brain to think of the perfect gift, that’s all.

 John:  Just tell me.  What should I get you for you r very important birthday?

Roberta:  What?  Just blurt it out?  I can’t do tha t.  I can give you a hint, but since you love me so much, I’m sure you can read my mind.

John:  That’s where you’re wrong.  If I had a nicke l for every time a woman thought I should be able to read her mind, I’d be t he richest man in the world!  I don’t have an inkling of what you have on your mind .

Roberta:  All right, I’ll make it more than a hint.   I’ll give you three clues.

John:  Great.  That’ll make things crystal clear.

This episode is a dialogue between Hugo and Melissa .  They’re going to talk about the way that people work – the style, the man ner that different people work, describing those different work styles that y ou might find at a job or in life generally.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hugo:  How do you like working with Leo?  Is it wor king out?

Melissa:  No, it’s not.  Our work styles completely  clash and we butt heads at every turn.

Hugo:  Really?  I thought you were partnered up bec ause you complemented each other’s strengths.

Melissa:  Yeah, but that doesn’t mean we can work w ell together.  I’m collaborative and like to talk things out.  Leo lik es to go solo.  He goes off on his own and comes back with a finished product, without  consulting with me at all.

Hugo:  Yeah, I’ve worked with Leo before and he lik es having autonomy, but he has to realize that the point of collaboration is t hat the sum is greater than the parts.  Two people pooling ideas will make the prod uct better.

Melissa:  That’s the idea, anyway.  Hey, I have a b etter idea.  What do you think of you and me teaming up?  We’re both collaborative .  We’d make a great team.

Hugo:  Yeah, but we also have the same skills.  Tha t’s why you’re working with Leo and I’m working with Lamar, remember?

Melissa:  Yeah, I remember.  I’m starting to think that collaboration is overrated.

[end of dialogue]

Hugo begins by saying, “How do you like working wit h Leo?”  He’s asking Melissa, “Is it working out?”  “To work out” is a t wo-word phrasal verb meaning, in this case, to be successful, to be effective, to be  the way that you hope or expect something to be.  “I hope this relationship works o ut with my girlfriend; I really like her.”  Or, “I hope my new job works out,” I hope th ings go well.  “To work out” can also mean to exercise at a gym, for example.

Melissa says, “No, it’s not (it is not working out) .  Our work styles completely clash and we butt heads at every turn.”  Oh dear, s adness here in our story. Melissa says that her work style and Leo’s work sty le completely clash.  “Work style” is the way that you work.  Some people like to work with other people, some people like to work alone, some people like to  do everything early, some people like to do everything at the very end, and s o forth.  When we say something “clashes” (clash), in this case it means the two things don’t go well together, they don’t match; they’re very different,  so it is a very bad combination of elements or of things.  “Clash” can have several  other meanings, and you can find those in the Learning Guide.

Melissa says that she and Leo butt heads at every t urn.  The phrase “to butt (butt) heads at every turn” means that you are alwa ys fighting, you’re often disagreeing about things, you’re constantly having arguments.  Hugo says, “Really?  I thought you were partnered up because y ou complemented each other’s strengths.”  “To partner up” is a phrasal v erb meaning to put people in groups of two for some purpose.  We might also say,  “to pair up.”  A teacher in a classroom might partner up the students to work on an activity: “Johnny, you work with Julie; and Bobby, you work with Billy,” a nd so forth.  Melissa and Leo in our story were partnered up because they complement ed each other’s strengths. “To complement” (complement) means to be a good mat ch or combination for someone or something.  If you like to draw and I li ke to write, and we have to make a children’s book, our talents – our abilities  complement each other.  They complete each other, you might think of it as.  “Co mpliment” can also be spelled with an “i” in the middle (compliment).  That “comp liment” is when you say something nice to someone: “You have beautiful red shoes on today my dear, my beautiful wife.”  I always compliment my wife on he r shoes and her hair, and that’s what a good husband does.  And if you want t o be a good husband, and

you don’t compliment your wife, well, you just need  to go back and study the book on how to become a good husband.  Unfortunatel y, they no longer make that book I think!

Anyway, our story talks about Melissa and Leo compl ementing each other’s strengths.  Your “strengths” are things that you do  well.  Melissa says, “Yeah, but that doesn’t mean we can work well together.  I’m c ollaborative and like to talk things out.”  “To be collaborative” means to do thi ngs as part of a team, to work well with other people.  “To talk things out” means  to talk about your ideas with another person so that you can get better ideas, or  perhaps you can become clearer in your thinking.  Someone who likes to tal k things out likes to have long conversations about something because they think th at will help them do a better job, and that’s what Melissa likes to do.  Leo is c ompletely different; “Leo likes to go solo.”  “To go solo” means to work by yourself.  “Solo” is one, or by yourself. Melissa says that Leo goes off on his own (meaning he goes somewhere else and works by himself) and comes back with a finishe d product (a completed project), without consulting with me at all.  “To c onsult (someone)” means to ask someone’s opinion before you do something or before  you make a decision.  Leo doesn’t consult with Melissa, he just does his proj ect without asking her opinion.

Hugo says, “Yeah, I’ve worked with Leo before and h e likes having autonomy.” “Autonomy” (autonomy) means independence, the abili ty to do things without having to ask other people for their opinion or for  their permission.  This word is often used in politics.  In certain countries there  are groups that want autonomy, or different parts of the country that want autonom y; they don’t want to be controlled by the national government.  Here in the  United States, each of our 50 states has a certain autonomy, things it can do by itself.  Hugo says that Leo has to realize that the point (or the purpose) of colla boration (of working with each other) is that the sum is greater than the parts.  This phrase, “the sum (sum) is greater than the parts,” while in some ways a logic al impossibility, is used to mean that people who work together are often able t o accomplish more than those people working by themselves.  It can also be  used, this phrase, to mean that a situation is very complicated and can’t be d escribed by individual elements or factors, or that when you put all those things t ogether you get something greater than what you would expect by just looking at the individual elements or parts.  So Hugo says that the point of collaboratio n is that the sum is greater than the parts.  “Two people pooling ideas will make the  product better.”  “To pool” (pool), used here as a verb, means to share or comb ine, to use two or more things together at the same time.  There are other meanings of the word “pool.” You can find out what they are by looking at the Le arning Guide for this episode.

Melissa says, “That’s the idea, anyway.  Hey, I hav e a better idea.  What do you think of you and me teaming up?”  “To team up” is a  phrasal verb meaning the same as to pair up, to partner up, to work with som eone else as a team.  Melissa says, “We’re both collaborative.  We’d make a great  team.”  Now, I’m not sure if Melissa actually wants to work with Hugo because he ’s a good worker.  Perhaps Melissa is interested in Hugo, and doesn’t like Leo .  You never know.  In an office, there are always these romantic attractions  or connections.

Melissa wants to work with Hugo.  Hugo says, “Yeah,  but we also have the same skills (we know how to do the same things; they don ’t complement each other). That’s why you’re working with Leo and I’m working with Lamar, remember?” Lamar is, I guess, another worker – a male worker.  Melissa says, “Yeah, I remember.  I’m starting to think that collaboration  is overrated.”  When we say something is “overrated” (one word), we mean that w e think of it more highly than it deserves to be, or we value it more highly than it deserves to be, than the actual or real value of something.  When people say  someone or something is “overrated,” they’re saying that people say it’s go od, they say it’s great, but it’s not as good as people say.  So for example: “That m ovie I saw last week was overrated.  Everyone said it was great, eh, it wasn ’t that great.”  Or, “This restaurant is overrated.  The food is good, but it’ s not great.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hugo:  How do you like working with Leo?  Is it wor king out?

Melissa:  No, it’s not.  Our work styles completely  clash and we butt heads at every turn.

Hugo:  Really?  I thought you were partnered up bec ause you complemented each other’s strengths.

Melissa:  Yeah, but that doesn’t mean we can work w ell together.  I’m collaborative and I like to talk things out.  Leo l ikes to go solo.  He goes off on his own and comes back with a finished product, without  consulting with me at all.

Hugo:  Yeah, I’ve worked with Leo before and he lik e to have autonomy, but he has to realize that the point of collaboration is t hat the sum is greater than the parts.  Two people pooling ideas will make the prod uct better.

# Voting in an Election

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 733: Voting in an Election.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 733.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can go there and do wnload a Learning Guide for this episode.  You can also get one of our Prem ium Business or Daily English courses on our ESL Podcast Store.

This episode is a dialogue between Khaled and Berni ce.  They’re talking about voting in an election and use a lot of vocabulary w e might use to describe democratic elections.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Khaled:  Are you going to the polling place or are you voting by absentee ballot again?

Bernice:  I always vote with an absentee ballot so I can vote in the comfort of my own home and in my own time.  In fact, I’ve already  mailed in my ballot.

Khaled:  Good for you.  Which candidate did you vot e for in the governor’s race?

Bernice:  I didn’t vote for either of the bozos tha t are running.  I voted for a write- in candidate.

Khaled:  A write-in candidate?  There isn’t a snowb all’s chance in hell that a write-in candidate is going to win this election.

Bernice:  That may be so, but I have to vote with m y conscience, and I can’t bring myself to vote for either of those people.  Have yo u voted?

Khaled:  Not yet.  I’m going to vote at the polls o n Election Day.  I want more time to think about whom to vote for and to read up on t he ballot measures.  There are a lot of them this time.

Bernice:  Yeah, but the governor’s race is the only  thing I care about.  I can’t stand the thought of having either of those bozos a s the next governor.

 Khaled:  Just out of curiosity, who did you write i n as a candidate?

Bernice:  You.

Khaled:  Me?!  You’re crazy.  I don’t want to be go vernor.

Bernice:  It was either you or me, and I’d rather n ot be a candidate and have to be in the company of those bozos.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Khaled saying to Bernice, “Are you going to the polling place or are you voting by absentee ballot again?”  A “polling place” is a place usually in a school or a library – although here in  California it could be in someone’s garage or living room, a place where you go to fill out a piece of paper or enter information in a computer to vote in  an election.  So, a polling place is a place where you go and vote.  Where I’m from, in Minnesota, when I was growing up polling places were always in school s or the basement of churches or other buildings – community or public b uildings.  Here in California, for some reason, a lot of the polling places are in  homes.  I think part of the reason is for that safety reasons the schools don’t  want all of these adults coming into the school, people they don’t know.

So Khaled is asking Bernice if she is going to go t o her polling place or if she is going to “vote,” she’s going to indicate who she wa nts to be elected, by absentee ballot.  “To be absent” (absent) means you are not there, it’s the opposite of “present.”  “Absentee” refers to someone who isn’t there.  It can be used as an adjective, as it is here, to describe something or someone who isn’t physically present.  A “ballot” (ballot) is the piece of paper , traditionally, that you mark on that indicates who you want to win the election, an d you give that ballot to someone and then they count the ballots.  So, an “a bsentee ballot” is this piece of paper, but you aren’t actually there at the poll ing place; you mail the ballot in. So here in the United States, in many states you ca n vote by mail.  I always vote by mail.  They send me the ballot, I fill it out, I  put a stamp on it, I mail it back.  I don’t have to go anywhere on the day that the elect ion is officially, which is what we would call “Election Day.”  Pretty clever, huh?

Bernice says, “I always vote with an absentee ballo t so I can vote in the comfort of my own home,” meaning I can be comfortable, I do n’t have to go out anywhere.  She also likes voting by absentee ballot  so she can vote “in her own

time,” meaning when she wants to do something, when  something is convenient to her.  Bernice says, “In fact, I’ve already maile d in my ballot.”

Khaled says, “Good for you.  Which candidate did yo u vote for in the governor’s race?”  A “candidate” is a person who wants to be e lected to a position.  The “governor” is the leader or head of the state.  Our  governor used to be Arnold Schwarzenegger, now it’s a man by the name of Jerry  Brown here in California, as I am recording this in 2011.  Khaled wants to kn ow who Bernice voted for in the governor’s race.  We use the word “race” (race)  here to mean an election.  It can also mean a competition between two people.  “R ace” has a number of other meanings also in English, and those can be found in  our Learning Guide.

Bernice says, “I didn’t vote for either of the bozo s that are running.”  A “bozo” (bozo) is here meant to mean a clown, more generall y an unintelligent person who is not doing his or her job very well, who does  a very poor job at something. So, she’s describing the candidates as bozos.  It’s  kind of like saying they’re idiots.  “I voted for a write-in candidate,” Bernic e says.  There are certain rules for being elected and being on the ballot in the United  States.  However sometimes, people don’t want to vote for anyone who is officia lly on the ballot, and so they will write someone’s name in.  This is perfectly le gal.  In some states you have to register your name if you want to be a write-in can didate, even though your name is not printed on the ballot.  Here in California, you can write in someone’s name, someone who is not officially on the ballot.  These  people almost never win, but some people like to do it as a protest to say, “I d on’t like any of you people.”  I have often written in candidates here for elections !

Khaled says, “A write-in candidate?  There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that a write-in candidate is going to win this election.”  The phrase “a snowball’s chance in hell” means absolutely no chance, no possibility , or simply impossible.  It’s impossible for a write-in candidate to win this ele ction, that’s what Khaled is saying.  A “snowball” is cold; it’s made from basic ally frozen water, or water crystals.  “Hell” in the Christian religion is wher e you go if you’re a bad person after you die, and traditionally it’s been thought of as a very hot place.  So, if you put a snowball in a hot place, of course the snowba ll will melt; it will disappear; it will become water and no longer be a snowball.  So,  a snowball’s chance in hell means no chance, because, of course, it would not b e able to survive.

Khaled says, “There isn’t a snowball’s chance in he ll that a write-in candidate is going to win this election,” this race, this compet ition.  Bernice says, “That may be so, but I have to vote with my conscience, and I  can’t bring myself to vote for either of those people.”  Your “conscience” is your  sense of right and wrong; what is the right thing to do, the correct thing to do, the ethical thing to do, and what is

the wrong thing to do.  Bernice says, “I can’t brin g myself to vote for either of those people.”  This expression, “to not be able to  bring yourself to do (something)” means that you can’t do it because you  think it is wrong, you can’t even force yourself to do it because you think it i s such a bad idea.  We might say, “Oh, she looks so happy.  I can’t bring myself  to tell her any bad news today.”  I just can’t do it.

Then Bernice asks Khaled, “Have you voted?” and he says, “Not yet.  I’m going to vote at the polls on Election Day.”  He’s going to go to the polling place and vote on the day of the election, Election Day.  He says, “I want more time to think about whom to vote for and to read up on the ballot  measures.”  “To read up on (something)” means to learn about something by read ing about it: reading information, reading books, websites, and so forth.   A “ballot measure” is a proposal for a new law that the people vote on dire ctly.  Normally you vote for people, and those people – those representatives vo te on the laws for your state or your city or your country.  However, sometimes i n American elections the people vote directly on a law.  It might be a law t o allow gambling or it might be a law to increase taxes.  Just about any kind of law can be voted on directly by the people in some states; not all states have this sys tem.  Khaled says, “There are a lot of them this time,” a lot of ballot measures.  Here in California, we always have many, many ballot measures; I think at least 5  or 10 every election.  These are laws that we are being asked to vote on directl y.

Bernice says, “Yeah, but the governor’s race is the  only thing I care about.”  She only cares about who wins the election for governor .  She says, “I can’t stand the thought of having either of those bozos as the next  governor.”  Bernice says, “I can’t stand.”  This means I cannot tolerate, I cann ot find acceptable.  “To be able to stand (something)” is to be able to tolerate it,  often because it is difficult.  We say, “I can’t stand it,” meaning I can no longer do  this, I can no longer be in this situation.  You might say, “I can’t stand the hot w eather.”  “I hate it” is another way of saying that.

Khaled says, “Just out of curiosity (just because I  want to know), who did you write in as a candidate?”  Remember, Bernice was go ing to write the name of someone in and not vote for the people whose names were on the ballot. Bernice says, “You.”  Khaled says, “Me?!  You’re cr azy.  I don’t want to be governor.”  Bernice responds, “It was either you or  me, and I’d rather not be a candidate and have to be in the company of those bo zos.”  “To be in the company of (someone)” means to spend time with some one, or to be in the same place as someone.  Bernice really doesn’t like the candidates; she calls them “bozos” no less than three times!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Khaled:  Are you going to the polling place or are you voting by absentee ballot again?

Bernice:  I always vote with an absentee ballot so I can vote in the comfort of my own home and in my own time.  In fact, I’ve already  mailed in my ballot.

Khaled:  Good for you.  Which candidate did you vot e for in the governor’s race?

Bernice:  I didn’t vote for either of the bozos tha t are running.  I voted for a write- in candidate.

Khaled:  A write-in candidate?  There isn’t a snowb all’s chance in hell that a write-in candidate is going to win this election.

Bernice:  That may be so, but I have to vote with m y conscience, and I can’t bring myself to vote for either of those people.  Have yo u voted?

Khaled:  Not yet.  I’m going to vote at the polls o n Election Day.  I want more time to think about whom to vote for and to read up on t he ballot measures.  There are a lot of them this time.

Bernice:  Yeah, but the governor’s race is the only  thing I care about.  I can’t stand the thought of having either of those bozos a s the next governor.

This episode is a dialogue between Ella and Jimmy.  It’s related to Halloween and uses a lot of vocabulary related to scary thing s.  Let’s get started.  Wah-ha- ha-ha ha-ha!  [evil laugh]

[start of dialogue]

Ella:  No matter what you say, I am not going out t onight.  It’s Halloween and evil things are lurking everywhere.

Jimmy:  Come on, it’s Halloween!  It’s the holiday when kids get dressed up and ask for candy.  There is nothing evil or creepy abo ut this day.  If you’re scared stiff, it’s your own doing.

Ella:  Don’t kid yourself.  This is the day when gh osts, witches, zombies, and vampires come out and have a field day.  I’ve got g oosebumps just thinking about it.

Jimmy:  Do you mean you actually believe in all of that stuff?  You are too old to be so gullible.  I’m going out.

Ella:  Look!  Hurry up and close that door!  There’ s a black cat.  Oh my God.  If you walk out that door, the next time I see you, it  might be in a graveyard.

Jimmy:  You’re crazy and I’m leaving.

Ella:  If you have to go, take these with you.

Jimmy:  What are they?

Ella:  It’s a cross and some garlic.  You’ll thank me later.

Jimmy:  Ugh!

[end of dialogue]

Ella begins by saying, “No matter what you say, I’m  not going out tonight.”  It doesn’t matter what you tell me, she’s saying, I’m not going to leave the house; I’m not going to go out somewhere tonight.  “It’s H alloween and evil things are lurking everywhere.”  “Halloween,” you may know, is  celebrated on October 31 st . It is the eve of All Hallows’ Day or, we would say in the United States, All Saints’ Day, and traditionally it’s been associated with sp irits, ghosts, scary things, and people here in the U.S., especially children, dress  up on this holiday and go around asking for candy.  We’ve talked about Hallow een on other episodes.  Go back and listen to episode number 73.

Ella says that there are evil things lurking everyw here.  “Evil” is bad, wrong, something that is very wrong, very, perhaps, immora l.  “To lurk” (lurk) means to be somewhere, but to be hidden away, perhaps waitin g to appear.  We have an expression, “he was lurking in the shadows.”  He wa s waiting there, perhaps for someone to come by.  It sounds like a dangerous thi ng, although it might not be. So “lurking” is waiting around, but hidden so no on e can see you.

Jimmy says, “Come on, it’s Halloween!  It’s the hol iday when kids get dressed up and ask for candy.”  “Come on” means change your mi nd Ella, don’t be so silly, don’t be that way.  This holiday – and by the way, it’s not technically a holiday in the United States.  You still have to work on Hallo ween.  “It’s the holiday when kids get dressed up.”  “To dress up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to put on different kind of clothing than you normally wou ld.  It could be clothing that’s very formal if you’re going to a wedding or a job i nterview.  Or it could be a “costume,” something that makes you look like a dif ferent kind of person, and that’s the kind of dressing up that Jimmy is talkin g about here.  On Halloween kids put on different costumes so they look like Sp iderman, and…and, I don’t know, Harry Potter.  I haven’t been paying attentio n recently.

So, Jimmy says, “There is nothing evil or creepy ab out this day.”  “Creepy” (creepy) means scary, but also uncomfortable, somet hing that makes you a little fearful or not very comfortable; “uneasy,” we might  say.  Jimmy says, “If you’re scared stiff, it’s your own doing.”  “To be scared stiff” (stiff) means to be very frightened, to be very scared.  You can’t do anythi ng because you are so afraid of what is going to happen or what is happening.  J immy says if that’s how

scared you are, “it’s your own doing,” meaning it’s  your own fault.  It’s because of something you do, not what someone else is doing.

Ella says, “Don’t kid yourself.”  “To kid (kid) you rself” means to make yourself believe something that isn’t true.  “To kid,” as a verb, normally means to joke with, to say something that isn’t really true just to be funny.  But the expression “to kid yourself” means, in a way, to play a joke o n yourself, to make yourself believe something that isn’t true.  She says, “This  is the day when ghosts, witches, zombies, and vampires come out and have a field day.”  A “ghost” traditionally has been defined as the spirit of a d ead person.  If you ever read the famous play Macbeth  by Shakespeare, you know that there is the ghost of Banquo.  When I was growing up there was a famous c artoon ghost, Casper. Casper the Ghost, whatever happened to him?  I thin k he died!  A “witch” is someone, usually a woman, who has magical powers an d uses them to do bad things.  If you saw the movie The Wizard of Oz , there were different witches in the movie; there were good witches and there were b ad witches, however, in The Wizard of Oz .  But normally a witch is someone we think of, aga in usually a woman, who has magic powers to do evil things.

A “zombie” is the body of a person who has died but  still walks around the Earth, even though he or she cannot speak.  So it’s a litt le different than a ghost; a ghost is just the spirit that can appear and disapp ear, that can travel through walls, and so forth.  A zombie is a actual body – a  dead body that walks around as if it were alive.  Of course, all of these thing s are imaginary, but that’s what they are when you read about them in fiction.

“Vampires” are people who are immortal; that is, th ey never die.  They traditionally have long, sharp teeth.  They walk in  the night, they can’t sleep, they bite people’s necks, and drink their blood.  Sounds  like an old girlfriend I had! The most famous vampire is probably Dracula, in Eng lish literature.  The second would probably be those guys from Twilight .  I don’t know.  There was a famous movie Interview with a Vampire , with I think it was Tom Cruise – who some people believe is actually a vampire!  I don’t know  if that’s true or not.

So, we have ghosts, witches, zombies, and vampires that come out, that can be seen, and they have a field day.  The expression “t o have a field (field) day” means to have fun, to do whatever you want, as much  as you want to do it.  Ella says, “I’ve got goosebumps just thinking about it.”   “Goosebumps” are little, small bumps or raised areas on your skin that are caused by either cold temperatures; that is, when it’s cold suddenly you may feel these  little bumps on your skin. Some people say they can also be caused by fear.  S o the idea that something gives you goosebumps means that it makes you very a fraid, very scared.

 There’s actually a famous children’s book series, v ery popular with young boys, at least it was a few years ago in the United State s called Goosebumps .  And, these are scary stories that were popular among fif th and sixth and seventh graders.  Some of them are actually kind of interes ting.  They’re easy English, and if you enjoy reading scary stories, and your En glish is still not ready for adult stories, well, Goosebumps  is not a bad option – not a bad choice.

Jimmy says, “Do you mean you actually believe in al l of that stuff (all of those things)?  You are too old to be so gullible.”  “To be gullible” (gullible) means to be easily tricked or deceived, to believe everything t hat you are told.  Jimmy says, “I’m going out (I’m going to leave the house).”

Ella says, “Look!  Hurry up and close that door!  T here’s a black cat.  Oh my God. If you walk out that door, the next time I see you,  it might be in a graveyard.” Okay, so traditionally if you see a black cat you h ave bad luck, and that’s what Ella sees when Jimmy opens the door.  She says, “If  you walk out that door, the next time I see you, it might be in a graveyard.”  A “grave” (grave) is where you put a body after it dies.  A “graveyard,” is also c alled a “cemetery,” it’s a large area where you have a lot of graves.  What Ella is saying is that if Jimmy leaves he might be killed.

Jimmy says, “You’re crazy and I’m leaving.”  Ella s ays, “If you have to go, take these with you.”  Jimmy says, “What are they?”  She  says, “It’s a cross and some garlic.  You’ll thank me later.”  A “cross” is two pieces of wood or some material that form like a “t”; is the symbol of the Christia n religion, where Jesus Christ was said to have died on a cross.  That’s why the cross  is a symbol of Christianity. Traditionally the idea was that if you had a cross,  you could hold it up and it would prevent evil beings from coming close to you or coming near you because they were afraid.  It was essentially a symbol of G od.  “Garlic” traditionally in literature was thought to have protected you agains t vampires – people like Tom Cruise!  So, Ella is offering Jimmy a cross and som e garlic so he can protect himself against these evil beings that she believes .  Jimmy says, “Ugh!”  He’s frustrated, he doesn’t believe what Ella is telling  him.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ella:  No matter what you say, I am not going out t onight.  It’s Halloween and evil things are lurking everywhere.

Jimmy:  Come on, it’s Halloween!  It’s the holiday when kids get dressed up and ask for candy.  There is nothing evil or creepy abo ut this day.  If you’re scared stiff, it’s your own doing.

Ella:  Don’t kid yourself.  This is the day when gh osts, witches, zombies, and vampires come out and have a field day.  I’ve got g oosebumps just thinking about it.

Jimmy:  Do you mean you actually believe in all of that stuff?  You are too old to be so gullible.  I’m going out.

Ella:  Look!  Hurry up and close that door!  There’ s a black cat.  Oh my God.  If you walk out that door, the next time I see you, it  might be in a graveyard.

Jimmy:  You’re crazy and I’m leaving.

Ella:  If you have to go, take these with you.

Jimmy:  What are they?

Ella:  It’s a cross and some garlic.  You’ll thank me later.

Jimmy:  Ugh!

# Getting a Visa to Travel

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 735: Getting a Visa to Travel.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 735.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at eslpod.com.  Download this epi sode’s Learning Guide, an 8- to 10-page guide we provide for all of our current episodes that will give you some additional help in improving your English.

This episode is a dialogue between Yesenia and Juli an.  It’s going to be about traveling to another country and getting special pe rmission, what we call a “visa,” to go there.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Yesenia:  I have a great idea.  Let’s plan a big pa rty for your mother’s 70 th birthday.  We’ll invite all of your relatives from all over the world.

Julian:  I don’t think very many of them can afford  to travel half way around the world for a party.

Yesenia:  I’ve already spoken to your rich brother and he’s already offered to pay for your family’s airfare and hotel.  If we plan it , he’ll pay for it.

Julian:  Julio offered to do that?  Well, if he’s o n board then we can give it a shot. But here’s another hitch.  My extended family lives  in a lot of different countries and I’m not sure they’ll get visas to visit the U.S ., especially on short notice.

Yesenia:  Let’s try, anyway.  Your cousins in Canad a don’t need a visa because most Canadian citizens don’t need one to cross the border.  What about your uncle in Korea?

Julian:  He’s already in the U.S. on an exchange vi sitor visa until June.  He should be able to come.

Yesenia:  What about your aunt in Greece?

Julian:  She won’t need a visa because Greece is on e of the countries in the Visa Waiver Program.

Yesenia:  Do you think your nephews in South Africa  will want to come?

Julian:  I’m not sure what the visa situation is th ere.  We’ll have to check with the State Department.

Yesenia:  I’ll get on the horn first thing in the m orning to see what I can find out.  I might email them and ask them to check with the emb assy or a consulate there to be sure.  This party is really shaping up.

Julian:  You seem to have it all under control.

Yesenia:  Haven’t you always said that party planni ng is my middle name?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Yesenia saying, “I have a great idea.  Let’s plan a big party for your mother’s 70 th  birthday.  We’ll invite all of your relatives from  all over the world.”  Your “relatives” are the people who are related to you either because you are their uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, brother , sister – any sort of relation that is by blood or by marriage.  That is, because they are somehow connected to you biologically – genetically, or because you m arried someone that is related to them.  So Yesenia wants to invite all of Julian’ s relatives.  Julian says, “I don’t think very many of them can afford to travel (have the money to travel) half way around the world for a party.”  We say “half way ar ound the world,” we often use that to indicate on another continent, in another p art of the world.

Yesenia says, “I’ve already spoken with your rich b rother and he’s already offered to pay for your family’s airfare and hotel.   If we plan it, he’ll pay for it.” Must be a very rich brother!  Julian says, “Julio o ffered to do that?  Well, if he’s on board then we can give it a shot.”  “To be on bo ard” means to be in agreement with something, to support some project o r to be involved in it.  Julian says, “we can give it a shot.”  “To give (something ) a shot” (shot) means to try something even when you are not sure if you are going to succeed – if you are going to be successful.  He says, “But here’s anoth er hitch” (hitch).  A “hitch” is a minor problem, something that makes it more difficu lt for you to do what you want to do.  He says, “My extended family lives in a lot  of different countries.”  Your “extended family” are the relatives that are not yo ur brother, your sister, your son or daughter, or your parents.  Everyone else is you r extended family: uncles, aunts, cousins, great-grandfathers, and so forth.  We call the people who are

closest to you – parents, brothers, sisters, and ch ildren – your “immediate family.”

Julian says that his extended family lives in a lot  of different countries, “and I’m not sure they’ll get visas to visit the U.S., espec ially on short notice.”  A “visa” (visa) is official permission that a country gives you to visit and stay for a certain amount of time in that country.  So if you are comi ng to the United States, from many countries you need a tourist visa or a student  visa or a work visa to come here, depending on what you are going to do.  The e xpression “on short notice” means without a lot of time to do something, withou t very much advance warning or advance notice.  Julian is saying there isn’t a lot of time to get, perhaps, some of these visas, and since it can sometimes take a l ong time to get a visa to come to the United States this may be a problem.

Yesenia says, “Let’s try, anyway.  Your cousins in Canada don’t need a visa because most Canadian citizens don’t need one to cr oss the border.”  “To be a citizen” means to be someone who is officially part  of a certain country.  You have certain rights, like voting; you may have cert ain responsibilities, like paying taxes.  That’s to be a citizen.  I’m a citizen of t he United States.  Some people are “dual citizens,” that is, they are citizens of more than one country.  The “border” (border) is the line – the imaginary line that separates two countries or two different parts of property.  It could be two s tates, it could be two cities; here, it refers to two countries: the United States and t he Country of Canada.  Yesenia says most Canadian citizens don’t need a visa to cr oss the border to come to the United States, to go from one side to the other.  “ What about your uncle in Korea?”  Julian says, “He’s already in the U.S. on an exchange visitor visa until June.”  An “exchange visitor visa” is permission to  enter the United States in some sort of exchange program, where some people fr om your country come here, some people from our country go to your count ry.  Usually it’s to study or to work for a certain amount of time.

By the way, I am not an expert on visas and coming to the United States, so unfortunately if you email me questions I probably won’t be able to answer them. If you have real questions about visas, you should talk to the U.S. Embassy or a representative of the U.S. government in your count ry.  Or even easier, go on the Internet and go to the website for that.

Anyway, back to our story.  Julian has an uncle in Korea, who’s on an exchange visitor visa.  Notice we say “on a visa,” not just “has a visa,” although you could say that.  Yesenia says, “What about your aunt in G reece?”  Julian says, “She won’t need a visa because Greece is one of the coun tries in the Visa Waiver Program.”  The “Visa Waiver Program” is a special p rogram the U.S. has that

allows citizens of 36 countries to enter the United  States for up to 90 days.  That is, from 1 to 90 days without having to get a visa.   There are many countries in this program.  The Czech Republic, Malta, and Brune i are three countries in the Visa Waiver Program, and no, I don’t know what the other ones are.

Yesenia says, “Do you think your nephews in South A frica will want to come?” Your “nephews” are, of course, the sons of your bro ther or sister.  Julian says, “I’m not sure what the visa situation is there.  We ’ll have to check with the State Department.”  “The State Department” is the oldest U.S. government department, I believe.  It deals with international relations, with passports, with visas.  As I record this, Hilary Clinton is the head of the Stat e Department.  The head of the departments we call “secretaries.”  She is the Secr etary of State.  The State Department is the organization that operates all of  the U.S. Embassies and Consulates throughout the world.  If you go to be t heir website, you will find information about visas, and they have their websit e in many different languages as well.

Julian says, “We have to check with the State Depar tment.”  Yesenia says, “I’ll get on the horn first thing in the morning to see w hat I can find out.”  “To get on the horn” means to call someone on a telephone.  It ’s a kind of an old expression, but you’ll still here it: “Get on the h orn and ask my brother when he’s coming over for dinner.”  Yesenia says, “I might em ail them and ask them to check with the embassy or consulate there to be sur e.”  An “embassy” is the official building where one country is represented in another country, usually in the capital city of that country.  So the embassies  from all the different countries of the world that have embassies in the United Stat es are in Washington, D.C. The “consulate” is the office or building where a f oreign government has representatives, but it’s not in the main city of t he country.  It’s something other than the embassy.  So for example, here in Los Ange les we have a consulate for many different governments.  The Mexican government , several Latin American and Asian governments have consulates here in the U nited States in different cities, and specifically here in Los Angeles.  If y ou want to get a visa to come to the United States, you often have to go to an embas sy or a consulate in your country.

Yesenia says, “This party is really shaping up.”  “ To shape up” is a two-word phrasal verb that here means to begin to progress, to advance, to begin to start to take form.  The word “shape” has several meaning s in English, however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ex planations.  Julian says to Yesenia, “You seem to have it all under control,” m eaning you seem to have everything worked out, you know what you’re doing.  Yesenia says, “Haven’t you always said (haven’t you always told me) that party  planning is my middle

name?”  “Party planning” is just what it sounds lik e; making plans, making arrangements for a celebration – a party.  We have this expression, “(something) is my middle name,” or “(something) is your middle name.”  It means that you are very good at what you do and you like to do it.  So  we might say, “Podcasting is my middle name,” meaning I am so interested and so enjoy doing podcasting that it is as if it were part of my own name, part of my own identity.  Whatever you love to do – skiing, or going on Facebook, or walki ng, or reading – you could say any of those activities are your middle name if you  are good at them, and/or if you really enjoy doing them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Yesenia:  I have a great idea.  Let’s plan a big pa rty for your mother’s 70 th birthday.  We’ll invite all of your relatives from all over the world.

Julian:  I don’t think very many of them can afford  to travel half way around the world for a party.

# Following One¡¦s Dream

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 736: Following One’s Dream.

This episode is a dialogue between Cassandra and La zlo.  It’s going to be talking about following your dream – your goal for the futu re.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cassandra:  I’ve had it!  I’m quitting and I’m not coming back.  I was meant for greater things than working in this pathetic place.   Life is passing me by.

Lazlo:  You can’t quit.  You need the money and you  have responsibilities, remember?

Cassandra:  I’ve sacrificed enough for security.  I  want to make a difference.  I want to do big things.  I want to have an impact on  the world.

Lazlo:  That’s very admirable.  Most people want to  make a difference in the world, but don’t have the guts to try.

Cassandra:  You are so right!  But I’m going to mak e it happen.  I aspire to do great things and I won’t rest until I do.  I want t o follow my dream.

Lazlo:  What is your dream?

Cassandra:  Um, well, I’m not quite sure what I’m d estined to do yet, but as soon as I figure out my true vocation, I’m following my heart.

Lazlo:  That’s great.  Until then, lunch break is o ver.  Could we get back to work?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Cassandra saying, “I’ve ha d it!”  When you say, “I’ve had it” you mean I have had enough; it’s an express ion of frustration.  You don’t want to continue doing what you’re doing or experie ncing what you’re experiencing anymore.  Cassandra says, “I’m quittin g (I’m leaving my job) and I’m not coming back.  I was meant for greater thing s than working in this pathetic place.”  When you say that you are “meant for” some thing you mean you are intended for something, or you have specific expect ations for yourself about something.  I feel I was meant for podcasting; this  is what my life has been preparing me to do.  Well, probably not, but that’s  the idea.  “Pathetic” (pathetic) means it’s very uninteresting, it doesn’t deserve a ny respect.  Someone says, “Oh, that was a pathetic attempt to make me laugh” meaning it was a very weak, uninteresting, not a good attempt.  So this is a pa thetic place, Cassandra says, “Life is passing me by.”  “To pass (someone) by” me ans to go on without you, especially we say this when time is passing very qu ickly and you feel as though you are missing opportunities in life.  “Life is pa ssing me by,” I’m getting older but I’m not experiencing anything better.

Lazlo says, “You can’t quit.  You need the money an d you have responsibilities, remember?”  Cassandra says, “I’ve sacrificed enough  for security.”  “To sacrifice” as a verb means to give something up, to decide not  to do something because you think there is some greater good – there is som e greater benefit in the future. Sometimes you have to sacrifice your appetite for f ood in order to lose weight; you have to give something up.  Or, people make sac rifices; they sacrifice so that their children can have a better life.  The parents  work more hours or work harder so that their children can go to a better school.  That would be an example of a sacrifice.

Cassandra says that she has sacrificed enough for s ecurity.  “Security” here means a feeling of safety, of stability, that you h ave money and a house or a place to live.  She says, “I want to make a differe nce.”  “To make a difference” means to change the world in some positive way, to change what is happening around you in some positive way.  There was a song back in the 1980s you may remember called “We Are the World.”  I think it was  Michael Jackson who wrote the song; he was trying to make a difference in the  world.  You remember: “We are the world / We are the children / We are the on es who make a brighter day / So let’s start giving / So let’s start giving.”  Ne ver liked that song, really?

Anyway, Cassandra says that she wants to make a dif ference – hopefully not singing “We Are the World!”  She says, “I want to d o big things (I want to do something that is important).  I want to have an im pact on the world.”  “To have an impact” (impact) is to have an affect on the wor ld, to do something that changes some other activity or some other people.  Nowadays, people use the

word “impact” as a verb.  I don’t like this use; I don’t use it myself, but it’s become acceptable to say that I am going to impact somethi ng.  Personally, I hate that use of the word, but it is becoming common.

Cassandra wants to have an impact.  That’s okay, “i mpact” as a noun there, as it’s supposed to be.  Lazlo says, “That’s very admi rable.”  When you say something is “admirable” you mean that you respect it, you value it.  “Admirable” comes from the verb “to admire” (admire).  When you  admire something you respect it, you think it’s good; you may want to be  like it.  Lazlo says, “Most people want to make a difference in the world, but don’t have the guts to try.” The word “guts” (guts) here means courage, bravery,  willing to do something that is difficult or even dangerous.  There are other me anings of the word “gut.”  Take a look at our Learning Guide to find those.

Cassandra says, “You are so right!”  She’s saying t o Lazlo that she agrees with him.  “But,” she says, “I’m going to make it happen .  I aspire to do great things and I won’t rest until I do (until I do great thing s).”  “To aspire” (aspire) means to try to do something that is difficult but important .  “He aspires to be in the Olympics.”  It’s not easy; it’s a very difficult go al, but he wants to do it – he aspires to do that.  Cassandra says she aspires to do great things and she won’t rest, meaning she’ll continue working until she doe s something great.  She says, “I want to follow my dream.”  This expression, “to follow your dream,” means to follow your goal, to do what you want to do.  To do  what you’ve always thought you should do, that’s to follow your dream.

Lazlo says, “What is your dream?”  Good question.  Cassandra says, “Um, well, I’m not quite sure (I’m not very sure) what I’m des tined to do yet.”  “To be destined (destined) to (something)” means to be int ended to be in the future or to have in the future.  It can simply mean the purpose  of something: “This man is destined to be a great leader.”  It’s almost as tho ugh that is the way that nature or God or fate has made this person.  They will eventu ally become great – they are destined to be great.  We have another word, “desti nation,” that’s the place where you are going.  You can see they are sort of related ideas.  Your goal, your object, your destination; they’re related to t his idea of being destined or intended for something.

Cassandra says she’s not sure what she’s destined to do yet, but as soon she figures out her true vocation, she will follow her heart.  A “vocation” (vocation) is what you believe that you should do – what career, what job you should do, but it’s a little more than just a job.  We have anothe r word, which is related to the meaning of “vocation,” which is “calling.”  “What i s your calling?”  It often relates to some deeper, sometimes even spiritual purpose or  religious purpose.  We talk

about vocations to the priesthood – to the ministry  in the Christian churches. That’s the idea; it’s a deeper sense of what you sh ould be doing.

Cassandra says she doesn’t know what her true vocat ion is, but when she finds out – when she figures it out – she’s following her  heart.  “To follow your heart” means to do what you believe is right, to do what y ou think is good or correct.  It can also be used, as I think it is here, to mean the same as to follow your dream. Lazlo says, “That’s great.  Until then (until you f igure it out), lunch break is over.” “Lunch break” is the time in the middle of the day,  usually at noon – at 12 p.m. in most places in the U.S., where you stop and eat a m eal, your lunch.  Lazlo says, “lunch break is over.  Could we get back to work?”  So, Cassandra has all these ideas and all these dreams, but she’s not really su re what she wants to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cassandra:  I’ve had it!  I’m quitting and I’m not coming back.  I was meant for greater things than working in this pathetic place.   Life is passing me by.

Lazlo:  You can’t quit.  You need the money and you  have responsibilities, remember?

Cassandra:  I’ve sacrificed enough for security.  I  want to make a difference.  I want to do big things.  I want to have an impact on  the world.

Lazlo:  That’s very admirable.  Most people want to  make a difference in the world, but don’t have the guts to try.

Cassandra:  You are so right!  But I’m going to mak e it happen.  I aspire to do great things and I won’t rest until I do.  I want t o follow my dream.

Lazlo:  What is your dream?

Cassandra:  Um, well, I’m not quite sure what I’m d estined to do yet, but as soon as I figure out my true vocation, I’m following my heart.

Lazlo:  That’s great.  Until then, lunch break is o ver.  Could we get back to work?

# Kitchen Appliances

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 737: Kitchen Appliances.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 737.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there – you know why !

The episode today is about kitchen appliances.  “Ap pliances” are the machines that you may have in your house that do certain thi ngs, and we’ll find out what those things are in this episode.  The dialogue is between Victoria and Justin, although those aren’t their real names.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Victoria:  As you can see, this executive apartment  is fully equipped.  When you called and asked for the best available apartment, I thought of this one immediately.  Just look at this kitchen!  All of the appliances are top of the line.

Justin:  Do you mind if I take a closer look?  I li ke to cook.

Victoria:  No problem.  The refrigerator has a high  capacity, with the freezer on the bottom.

Justin:  But there’s no ice maker.

Victoria:  No, that’s one of the few things it does n’t have.

Justin:  Hmm…Is this range gas or electric?

Victoria:  It’s gas, and it has a broiler on the bo ttom, see?

Justin:  Is the stove self-cleaning?

Victoria:  I’m afraid not, but it’s stainless steel , as you can see.

Justin:  That’s too bad.  Is the dishwasher new?

Victoria:  It’s not brand new, but it’s in very goo d condition.  The microwave, toaster, and coffee maker also come with the apartm ent.  What do you think?  Do you think it’ll suit your needs?

Justin:  When I asked for your best, I expected the  Cadillac of apartments. You’ve shown me a Pinto!

[end of dialogue]

Victoria begins by saying, “As you can see, this ex ecutive apartment is fully equipped.”  When we say something is “an executive apartment,” we’re referring to an apartment for someone important, someone who would be a leader or a manager in a company – that’s what an “executive” i s – usually a large company or organization.  Victoria seems to be showing Just in this apartment.  Maybe she’s the owner; maybe she’s just a “real estate ag ent,” someone who shows you different properties you may want to rent or bu y.  Victoria says that this executive apartment is fully equipped.  “To be equi pped” (equipped) means to have certain equipment or certain features.  “To be  fully equipped” means to be completely equipped; it has all the equipment that you would want.  She says, “When you called and asked for the best available a partment, I thought of this one immediately.  Just look at the kitchen!”  The u se of the word “just” here is just for emphasis.  “Look at the kitchen.”  “Just look a t the kitchen!”  They mean the same, but “just” adds a little bit more emphasis to  the statement, a little bit more power.  She says, “All of the appliances are top of  the line.”  An “appliance” is a piece of equipment that you use in your home, espec ially in the kitchen.  Victoria says these are top of the line.  The expression “to p of the line” means to be the best type of something, the highest quality, and so metimes – often – the most expensive.

Justin says, “Do you mind (is it okay) if I take a closer look?”  “To take a closer look” means to inspect or examine or look at someth ing very carefully.  You want to make sure it is what they say it is.  Justin say s, “I like to cook.”  Victoria says, “No problem.  The refrigerator has a high capacity. ”  A “refrigerator,” sometimes called simply the “fridge,” when I was growing up it was called in my house the “icebox.”  An “icebox” is an old style of refrigera tor before there was electricity. Now, we had electricity in Minnesota in the 1960s.  However, that’s what my parents called it, perhaps from their own childhood , and so that’s what we called it.  The refrigerator was called the “icebox.”  Ice , of course, was put in to keep things cold when you didn’t have a motor inside to make the air cold.

Well, Victoria says that the refrigerator in this a partment is high capacity. “Capacity” is the amount of something that you can put in a certain place, the

amount of space.  “High capacity” would mean I thin k the same as “large capacity,” meaning it’s a big refrigerator.  “With a freezer on the bottom,” she adds.  A “freezer” (freezer) is a large appliance t hat keeps food frozen.  In a refrigerator, the temperature is probably going to be around 40 degrees – 38 to 42 degrees Fahrenheit.  In a freezer it’s going to be below 32 degrees Fahrenheit so things freeze; they become solid.  Water becomes  solid below 32 degrees Fahrenheit.  Well, that’s what a “freezer” is; it f reezes things.  Most people have a combination refrigerator-freezer, with the freezer on the top or the bottom and refrigerator on – well, where the freezer is not.  In my house growing up we had a separate freezer and a separate refrigerator becaus e, well, we needed a lot of food to feed all of the people in my family.

Justin says, “But there’s no ice maker.”  An “ice m aker” is a part of the freezer that some freezers have – not all of them do – that  makes ice cubes for you.  So, you don’t have to put water into a little what we w ould call an “ice cube tray” in order to have ice cubes, it will make them for you automatically.  I always thought that ice makers were for people who were kind of la zy.  I mean, how difficult is it to put the water into a little container?  The prob lem is people forget, of course.  I have a new freezer that has an ice maker and I love  it, so I understand now why people like ice makers.  I keep talking about mysel f.  Do you notice that?  I don’t know why that is.  Let’s get back to our dialogue.

Justin says, “there’s no ice maker.”  Victoria resp onds, “No, that’s one of the few things it doesn’t have (it does not have).”  Justin  says, “Hmm…Is this range gas or electric?”  A “range” (range) in this dialogue m eans a large surface in a kitchen that has several places to cook things.  It has sev eral burners that have fire or flame or heat that you can cook food with.  You put  a “pan,” a large metal object that’s flat or rounded – slightly rounded; you can cook things like eggs or hamburgers on a range.  It’s usually on the top of what’s called a “stove” (stove), which is a combination of a range and an oven.  An “oven” is a box that you heat basically, and it cooks food, things like cakes.  O r, if you were going to prepare and cook a turkey, you would put it in an oven.  It ’s a big box that gets very hot, and you close the door, and it cooks the food.  Tha t’s an “oven.”  A range is on the top, where you cook food in pans.  The combinat ion is called a “stove,” where you have a range and an oven.

Most houses in cities – large cities have gas at the house, and these ranges – the ovens, the stoves – they’re all powered by gas.   However, there are some places that do not have gas, newer cities.  For exa mple, when I was living in Arizona for a while they had electric appliances, s o there was no gas line that went to the house.

Justin asks if this range is gas or electric.  Vict oria says, “It’s gas, and it has a broiler on the bottom, see?”  Some stoves in additi on to having an oven and a range have something underneath the oven called a “ broiler.”  It’s a place where the heat becomes more intense more quickly.  If you  are going to cook some steaks you may want to broil them, put them in this  very hot oven underneath the main oven, typically.  Usually the fire is closer t o the food and therefore cooks it more quickly as well as gives you a certain brownne ss on the food, if that’s what you want.  Well, Justin asks if the stove self-clea ning.  Victoria says, “I’m afraid not (which is a polite way of saying no), but it’s stainless steel, as you can see.” “Stainless steel” is a silver-colored metal that do esn’t rust, and it’s very popular in modern kitchens.

The stove is stainless steel, but it’s not self-cle aning.  Justin says, “That’s too bad.  Is the dishwasher new?”  A “dishwasher” (one word) is a large machine that washes dishes.  That seems pretty obvious!  A dishw asher could be a human being if you don’t have a machine; I am the dishwas her in my household. Victoria says, “It’s not brand new (meaning the dis hwasher isn’t new out of the store), but it’s in very good condition.  The micro wave, toaster, and coffee maker also come with the apartment (are included in the r ent of the apartment).”  A “microwave” is a special kind of oven that uses ele ctric waves to cook or heat food quickly.  A “toaster” (toaster) makes “toast,”  which is bread that is browned when it is cooked.  There are some other meanings of “toast” and “toaster,” as well as the word “range” that we used earlier.  Tho se can be found in the Learning Guide for this episode.

The apartment also comes with a “coffee maker.”  Ag ain, obviously, something that makes coffee, a small machine – a small kitche n appliance.  Victoria asks Justin, “What do you think?  Do you think it’ll sui t your needs?” and Justin says, “When I asked for your best (your best apartment), I expected the Cadillac of apartments.”  The expression “the Cadillac of” mean s the very best of something. In the United States, a Cadillac at least used to b e considered one of the best cars; only very rich people drove Cadillacs.  That’ s not true anymore; it’s not one of the best cars in most places, but we still have that expression: “the Cadillac of podcasters,” “the Cadillac of laptops,” “the Cadill ac of coffee cups,” whatever. Well, Justin wanted the best, “the Cadillac of apar tments.”  Instead, he says, Victoria has shown him a Pinto.  A “Pinto” is anoth er kind of car, but the opposite of a Cadillac.  It was a very poorly made car; I be lieve it was made by Ford Motor Company back in the 70s.  They don’t make Pintos an ymore, but because it had the reputation for being such a bad car people may still use it as an example of something of very poor quality.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Victoria:  As you can see, this executive apartment  is fully equipped.  When you called and asked for the best available apartment, I thought of this one immediately.  Just look at this kitchen!  All of the appliances are top of the line.

Justin:  Do you mind if I take a closer look?  I li ke to cook.

# Talking to a Mechanic

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 738: Talking to a Mechanic.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 738.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faste r.

This episode is called “Talking to a Mechanic.”  A “mechanic” is a person who fixes cars – automobiles.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mechanic:  Hi, I’m the mechanic.  What can I do for  you?

Amy:  My car is making a very weird noise.  It soun ds like this: gulug, gulug, gulug…

Mechanic:  Hm, that doesn’t sound good.  Where is it coming from?

Amy:  I’m not sure.  When I’m in the car, it sounds  like it’s coming from the engine, but when I get out of the car, it sounds li ke it’s coming from directly under the trunk, maybe the muffler?

Mechanic:  That’s not a noise a muffler would make.   Let me take a look.  Can you start the car and pop the hood?

Amy:  Sure.

Mechanic:  Well, I don’t hear the sound right now, but your battery needs replacing, you have a coolant leak, your carburetor  needs adjusting, and your spark plugs are shot.  I need to look under the car .

Amy:  Okay, go ahead.

Mechanic:  Your brake pads need replacing and your tires need balancing.

Amy:  But are any of those problems causing that ho rrible noise?

 Mechanic:  I don’t know.  I don’t hear the noise ri ght now, so it’s hard to tell.  But that’s all work you need to have done on this car a nyway for it to run right.  It’s only a matter of time before your car stops working  if you don’t take care of those problems.

Amy:  I come in with one problem and you find 10 ot hers.  I guess you should go ahead.  What else can I do?

Mechanic:  Um, buy a bus pass?

[end of dialogue]

Our episode begins with the “mechanic,” the person who fixes cars, asking – or rather saying, “I am the mechanic.  What can I do f or you?”  How can I help you? Amy says, “My car is making a very weird noise (a v ery strange noise).  It sounds like this: gulug, gulug, gulug…”  The mechanic says , “Hm, that doesn’t sound good.  Where is it coming from?”  Where is the soun d coming from?  Amy says, “I’m not sure.  When I’m in the car, it sounds like  it’s coming from the engine.” The “engine” is the motor; it’s the part of the car , usually in front, that makes the car go; it gives it power.  Amy says, “but when I g et out of the car, the noise sounds like it’s coming from directly under the tru nk, maybe the muffler?”  The “trunk” (trunk) is the back part of the car, the pa rt that usually you store things in – you put things in to keep while you are driving.  Amy says that the sound sounds like it’s coming from under or underneath the trunk.  “Maybe,” she’s guessing, “the muffler?”  A “muffler” (muffler) is a part of the car that muffles or covers – lessens – the noise from the car.

The mechanic says, “That’s not a noise a muffler wo uld make.”  So the sound that Amy made didn’t sound like a sound a muffler w ould make, according to the mechanic.  He says, “Let me take a look.  Can you s tart the car (can you turn the car on) and pop the hood?”  The “hood” (hood) here means the cover of the front of the car.  We talked about the trunk of the car i n the back.  The front of the car has a metal cover over it, and we call that the “ho od.”  “To pop the hood” means to open the hood.  In many cars, there’s a little b utton that you either push or pull that unlocks the hood; you push it in or you pull it out.  That’s where we get the verb “to pop,” to unleash, to unlock in one quick a ction.

So, the mechanic opens the hood after Amy pops the hood, and although the dialogue doesn’t indicate he clearly had to take so me time to look at the engine and the parts underneath the hood.  He comes back a nd says, “Well, I don’t hear the sound right now, but your battery needs replaci ng.”  Your “battery” is a source

of stored electrical power that is used to help sta rt the car, as well as for other parts of your car that require electricity.  The me chanic also tells Amy that she has a coolant leak.  “Coolant” (coolant) is a liqui d that you put into the car’s motor – technically into the radiator of the car – that h elps keep the engine cool so it doesn’t get too hot.  A “radiator” is something tha t gives off or radiates heat, in this case to try to get rid of the heat.  You can a lso have a radiator in your house. It’s not the same as a car radiator, but it has the  same function of giving off heat to help warm up your house.  Some old houses still have radiators.  The house that I grew up in had metal radiators all along and  through the house.  But anyway, we’re talking about cars, not my old house.

The mechanic thinks that Amy has a coolant leak.  A  “leak” (leak) here means the slow movement of liquid coming out of some cont ainer or some hose, usually through a small hole that you don’t want to be ther e.  The mechanic also says that Amy’s carburetor needs adjusting.  A “carburet or” (carburetor) is the part of the car engine that mixes the gasoline with air so that it can be used in the engine.  The mechanic also says that Amy’s spark pl ugs are shot.  The “spark (spark) plugs” are the parts of the car that create  a spark, it’s almost like a small, quick fire to make the gasoline burn and to help ru n the engine.  When we say something is “shot” (shot) – that can have a couple  of different meanings – here it means completely ruined, no longer able to work or function properly.  That’s one meaning of “shot.”  There are other meanings that can be found in our Learning Guide.  Our Learning Guide also, in this episode, t alks about other meanings of the word “trunk,” which we talked about earlier.

So the mechanic finds all these problems.  Then he says, “I need to look under (or underneath) the car.”  Amy says, “Okay, go ahea d.”  And again, we assume that the mechanic has taken some time even though it isn’t indicated in our dialogue.  Either that, or he’s the most intelligen t mechanic in the world!  The mechanic says, “Your brake pads need replacing and your tires need balancing.” Your “brakes” are the parts of the car that slow the car down or stop the car.  A “brake pad” is a part of the brakes that pushes aga inst part of the wheel in order to slow it or stop it, and typically after so many miles you need to replace or get new brake pads, and that’s what the mechanic is say ing Amy needs to do.  She also needs to have her tires balanced.  Cars typica lly have four wheels, and around the wheel there is something made of rubber that’s called a “tire” (tire). When you put new tires on sometimes they have to be  balanced so that they’re all basically the same in terms of how they’re adju sted.

Amy says, “But are any of those problems causing th at horrible noise?”  That bad noise that she came in and asked the mechanic about  at the beginning of our dialogue.  The mechanic says, “I don’t know.  I don ’t hear the noise right now, so

it’s hard to tell.”  When we say something is “hard  to tell” we mean it’s difficult to know, it’s difficult to determine or figure out.  “ But that’s all work (all of those repairs) you need to have done on this car anyway f or it to run right (for it to operate correctly).  It’s only a matter of time,” h e says, “before your car stops working if you don’t take care of those problems.”  “It’s only a matter of time” means that something will definitely happen in the future, eventually.  You don’t know when exactly, but you know if things continue as they are now this thing will eventually happen.  It’s only a matter of time that  all of us are going to die; it will happen to every one of us.  We don’t know when, som eday, hopefully not too soon for most of us.

Amy then says, “I come in (meaning I come here) wit h one problem (the noise) and you find 10 others.  I guess you should go ahea d (meaning I guess you should go ahead and do the repairs).  What else can  I do?”  That’s something that many of us feel when we go into a mechanic.  W e don’t know what the problem is.  They tell us they know what the proble m is, and they fix it, but we’re never really sure exactly, in most cases, what the problem was.  We have to trust the mechanic to a certain extent.  Amy asks, “What else can I do?”  What other choice do I have but to get these repairs made?

The mechanic says, “Um, buy a bus pass?”  A “bus pa ss” is usually a little card or a piece of paper that allows you to get on and o ff of the public buses.  You usually pay a certain amount for a week or a month or 10 days.  Or sometimes you pay for the number of rides that you take, you can get on the bus 10 times for example.  All of these are examples of bus pass es.  You can have a pass to a lot of things.  In many cases, it means a ticket to  something, and that’s really what a bus pass is.  It’s a ticket to get on and of f – well, to get on the bus.  They don’t usually ask for a ticket to get off the bus, although that might be a good way of making some more money, I’m not sure.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mechanic:  Hi, I’m the mechanic.  What can I do for  you?

Amy:  My car is making a very weird noise.  It soun ds like this: gulug, gulug, gulug…

Mechanic:  Hm, that doesn’t sound good.  Where’s it  coming from?

Amy:  I’m not sure.  When I’m in the car, it sounds  like it’s coming from the engine, but when I get out of the car, it sounds li ke it’s coming from directly under the trunk, maybe the muffler?

Mechanic:  That’s not a noise a muffler would make.   Let me take a look.  Can you start the car and pop the hood?

# Performing an Intervention

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 739: Performing an Intervention.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 739.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there and take a loo k at our ESL Podcast Store, with some additional courses for you, in English of  course.

This episode is called “Performing an Intervention. ”  That’s when people come together and try to get someone who has a problem, especially a problem with addiction, to stop and get help.  Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Petra:  Hey, what’s going on here?  Why are all of you here in my apartment?

Johann:  Your family and close friends are here to perform an intervention.  We feel that you have a problem that is negatively aff ecting your life and the lives of the people around you.

Petra:  An intervention?!  I don’t need an interven tion.  What am I supposed to be addicted to?

Johann:  I think you know.  Each of us can attest t o your obsession and the consequences of that addiction.  It is interfering with your work and your personal relationships.

Petra:  No, it’s not.  I can’t believe this.  I fee l cornered!

Johann:  We just want to help you.  We all agree th at you need to see a therapist and maybe go into treatment.

Petra:  You guys are all crazy.  Is that an ultimat um?

Johann:  Yes, I’m afraid it is.  If you don’t stop your obsessive behavior, we’ll take that away.

Petra:  What?!  Take away my MP3 player?  If you ta ke away my MP3 player, how am I supposed to listen to ESL Podcast?

Johann:  That’s the idea.  Listening to ESL Podcast  14 hours a day is not healthy.

Petra:  Okay, I know I’ve gone overboard, but I’ll stop.  I promise.

Johann:  You’ll stop cold turkey?

Petra:  Well…I need to be weaned off, I think.  How  about if I cut back to 10 hours a day to start?

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Petra saying, “Hey, what ’s going on here (what is happening here)?  Why are all of you here in my apa rtment?”  Obviously, there’s a group of people there.  Johann says, “Your family  and close friends are here to perform an intervention.”  An “intervention” in thi s case means a meeting where close friends and relatives usually surprise an ind ividual, who isn’t expecting a meeting, because they are concerned about this pers on’s activities, usually involving an “addiction,” when you can’t stop doing  something.  We think about drug addictions, alcohol addictions, gambling addic tions, and so forth.  Johann says that they’re here “to perform” or to do an int ervention.  He says, “We feel (we believe) that you have a problem that is negati vely affecting your life and the lives of the people around you.”  “To affect” means  to have some influence or impact on something, to change something in some wa y.  They’re saying that Petra’s addiction is affecting other parts of her l ife, usually in a negative way.

Petra says, “An intervention?!  I don’t need an int ervention.  What am I supposed to be addicted to?”  “To be addicted to” means to h ave an addiction regarding or involving something.  “I’m addicted to gambling” me ans that I can’t stop gambling.  I want to gamble all the time, or I’m ga mbling in such a way that it is hurting me but I can’t stop; I feel like I cannot s top it.  That’s an addiction.  That’s just an example, by the way; I am not myself a gamb ler.

So, Petra is wondering what she is addicted to.  Jo hann says, “I think you know (you know what it is).  Each of us can attest to yo ur obsession and the consequences of that addiction.”  “To attest” (atte st) is to say it or prove that something is true based on your experiences – based  on some facts that you know of.  These friends and family of Petra can att est to her obsession.  An “obsession” is something that you think about all of the time, something you

cannot stop thinking about.  Some men have obsessio ns about women – specific women; we would say they are “obsessed with” them.  In this case, the friends and family of Petra believe she has an obsession, a nd they can also attest to the consequences of her addiction.  The “consequences” are the results, what happens because of, in this case, the addiction.  J ohann says, “It is interfering with your work and your personal relationships.”  “ To interfere with (something)” is to interrupt it, to make it less successful or l ess effective, to slow it down.  If an addiction is interfering with your work, it means t hat you are not working as well you should because you have this addiction.

Petra says, “No, it’s not (it’s not interfering wit h my work or personal relationships).”  She says, “I can’t believe this.”   When someone is frustrated or is confused or surprised by something they may say thi s.  “I can’t believe this.  I feel cornered!”  “To be cornered” means to be trapped in  a place and you are unable to leave; you cannot escape.  “Corner” has a couple  of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some  of those.

Johann says, “We just want to help you.  We all agr ee that you need to see a therapist and maybe go into treatment.”  Johann say s that they believe that Petra needs to see a therapist.  The word “therapist” (th erapist) can refer to a couple of different kinds of people: it could be a psychologi st, it could be a medical doctor – a psychiatrist, it could be someone trained in help ing people with addictions – a counselor.  If you put a word in front of “therapis t” sometimes you know more specifically.  These examples are all dealing with emotions, thoughts, and feelings – psychological issues, but you could also  have a physical therapist. That would be someone who helps you get over a cert ain problem.  Maybe you broke your leg and now you need to get your leg str engthened after the operation or whatever happened.  That would mean you would go  to a physical therapist, who would help you.

Well, Petra needs a therapist to help her with her addiction.  Johann says that maybe she needs to go into treatment.  “Treatment” is a general term that refers to a program to help cure or help you when you are ill or sick.  In this case, treatment usually involves going to a separate hous e or building specifically for people who have this addiction, and you stay there.   Here in Hollywood, there are several places – very expensive – where celebrities  who are having addiction problems go.  Some of them go many times!

Petra says, “You guys are all crazy.  Is that an ul timatum?”  An “ultimatum” is when you say something to someone that if they don’ t do something, something bad will happen to them.  It’s a kind of threat, or  could be.  It’s the last thing that you can do before something bad happens, in this ca se.

 So, Petra’s asking if this is an ultimatum that she  go see the therapist.  Johann says, “Yes, I’m afraid it is.”  Remember, when we a re telling someone some bad news we often say “I’m afraid.”  It doesn’t mean yo u’re actually scared of anything; it’s just a polite way of saying somethin g negative or bad to someone: “I’m afraid that I cannot go with you today.”  You’ re giving someone bad news. Well, Johann says, “I’m afraid (that this is an old  an ultimatum).  If you don’t stop your obsessive behavior, we’ll take that away.”

Johann is going to takes something away if Petra do esn’t stop her behavior. Petra says, “What?!  Take away my MP3 player?  If y ou take away my MP3 player, how am I supposed to listen to ESL Podcast? ”  Ah, now we understand her addiction!  Johann says, “That’s the idea.  Lis tening to ESL Podcast 14 hours a day is not healthy.”  “Healthy” is something that  is good for your physical or mental wellbeing – your being well, the opposite of  sick.  Petra says, “Okay, I know I’ve gone overboard, but I’ll stop.  I promise .”  “To go overboard” here means to do too much of something, to engage in som e sort of extreme behavior, or to do too much of any sort of action.  You meet a girl and the second day that you are with her you ask her to marry you;  you bring her dozens of flowers; you buy her a car.  That’s probably going overboard, even if you like the woman.  It’s actually a pretty good way of getting the woman to run away from you – not that I have any personal experience in th at.  I mean in going overboard; lots of women have run away from me, trust me!

Anyway, Johann says that listening to ESL Podcast i s not healthy – 14 hours a day listening to ESL Podcast.  Petra says, “I know I’ve gone overboard, but I’ll stop.  I promise.”  Johann asks, “You’ll stop cold turkey?”  To stop something “cold turkey” is to immediately end some activity, usually something that is not good for you such as an addiction.  So if you are a  smoker – you like to smoke cigarettes – and you stop cold turkey, that means t hat you stop suddenly.  You say one day, “No more cigarettes,” and you don’t sm oke another cigarette the rest of your life – or at least the rest of that we ek!  That would be going cold turkey or stopping cold turkey.  Why “cold turkey”?   I have no idea.

Petra says, “Well…I need to be weaned off, I think. ”  “To be weaned (weaned) off (something)” is to slowly reduce the amount or numb er of something that you are addicted to.  It’s not the same as cold turkey, it’ s not suddenly; it’s slowly.  Some people, for example, who are addicted to nicotine, will wear nicotine patches, things on their arm, or they’ll chew nicotine gum t o wean them off slowly from this addiction.  Petra says, “How about if I cut back to  10 hours a day to start?”  “To cut back” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to red uce, to decrease the number or amount of something.  Petra is saying that she n eeds to quit her addiction

slowly.  Instead of listening for 14 hours she’ll l isten for 10 hours, which of course we know is still probably a little bit too much tim e, even for ESL Podcast.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Petra:  Hey, what’s going on here?  Why are all of you here in my apartment?

Johann:  Your family and close friends are here to perform an intervention.  We feel that you have a problem that is negatively aff ecting your life and the lives of the people around you.

Petra:  An intervention?!  I don’t need an interven tion.  What am I supposed to be addicted to?

Johann:  I think you know.  Each of us can attest t o your obsession and the consequences of that addiction.  It is interfering with your work and your personal relationships.

Petra:  No, it’s not.  I can’t believe this.  I fee l cornered!

Johann:  We just want to help you.  We all agree th at you need to see a therapist and maybe go into treatment.

Petra:  You guys are all crazy.  Is that an ultimat um?

Johann:  Yes, I’m afraid it is.  If you don’t stop your obsessive behavior, we’ll take that away.

Petra:  What?!  Take away my MP3 player?  If you ta ke away my MP3 player, how am I supposed to listen to ESL Podcast?

Johann:  That’s the idea.  Listening to ESL Podcast  14 hours a day is not healthy.

Petra:  Okay, I know I’ve gone overboard, but I’ll stop.  I promise.

Johann:  You’ll stop cold turkey?

Petra:  Well…I need to be weaned off, I think.  How  about if I cut back to 10 hours a day to start?

# Corporate Gift-Giving

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 740: Corporate Gift-Giving.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 740.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  You can also go to our ESL Podcast Store and buy some additional courses in daily and business English.  This episode is called “Corporate Gift-Giving.”  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Michelle:  Why did I get stuck with buying corporate gifts for our clients this year?  Just because I’m a woman doesn’t mean I’m good at buying gifts.  Rafiq:  It’s not because you’re a woman.  It’s because you’re the most junior employee of the company.  I had the job three years ago when I started working here.  Michelle:  Oh, so you know the drill.  I was thinking of sending food baskets to McQ Corp.    Rafiq:  I wouldn’t advise doing that.  We’re bidding on a new contract with their company and the gift could be misconstrued as a bribe.  You’ll want to avoid any appearance of impropriety.  Michelle:  Then I shouldn’t send anything at all?    Rafiq:  You could send a charitable donation in the company’s name.  This way, we show our appreciation for their business, and they get recognition for the contribution to a worthy cause, without seeming like we’re trying to influence their decision.  Michelle:  That seems like a good way to go.  What about the other companies we’re doing business with? # Playing in a Tournament

This episode is a dialogue between Irene and Kent.  It uses vocabulary we would talk about in describing a formal competition or to urnament.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Irene:  How is your team doing in the standings?

Kent:  They’re seeded sixth and they’re in a bracke t with one of the best teams in the tournament.  Our team has already lost to them.

Irene:  I thought it was a double-elimination tourn ament.

Kent:  It is.  That’s the only reason they’re not o ut of contention for the title.

Irene:  Why did the organizers get rid of the round -robin rounds?

Kent:  I think it’s because they wanted to cut down  on the number of games overall.  I’m not sure.

Irene:  Your team is the defending champion.  What happened this year?  Why aren’t they ranked higher?

Kent:  They didn’t have a very good season.  There were a lot of injuries, and as the coach, I had some run-ins with a couple of the new players.  Let’s just say we had some clashes in personality.

Irene:  Isn’t there a game this afternoon?

Kent:  Yeah, but I have to feed my team first.  The y won’t play until they get what they want.

 Irene:  What do they want?

Kent:  Ice cream.  Who knew six-year-olds could be so demanding?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Irene saying, “How is your  team doing in the standings?”  The “standings” (standings – plural) m eans the list of how good a set of teams are.  Standings always relate to the r ankings: is your team in first place, in second place, in last place, and so forth .  So in any competition, especially a sports competition where you have diff erent teams playing over a long period of time, you will have standings – you will have rankings.  Some will be best, some will be worst.  Well, one will be bes t and one will be worst – you get the idea.

Kent says that his team is seeded sixth and they’re  in a bracket with one of the best teams in the tournament.  “To be seeded” comes  from the verb “to seed” (seed), which here means that you put an athlete or  a team in a certain position in a tournament so that the better the team, the mo re likely they are to advance in the tournament.  It can be quite complicated, bu t basically where you are seeded in a tournament determines whom you will be playing.  Kent says that his team is in a bracket with one of the best teams in the tournament.  The best way to understand a bracket is to take an example.  Let ’s say that you have eight teams, and you want to determine who is the best am ong the eight teams.  So you have team A play team B; team C plays team D.  The winner of the A-B game plays the winner of the C-D game.  And then, f or the other four teams – E and F, G and H – E plays F, G plays H, and the winn er of those games play each other.  Then finally, the winner of the A-B-C-D “br acket” or side of the tournament plays the winner of the E-F-G-H side of the tournam ent.  So, a “bracket” is the – you can think of it as the A and B is a bracket, or  the A, B, C, and D could be considered a larger bracket or section of the tourn ament.  Kent is saying that his team is in a bracket with one of the best teams in the tournament.  So if his team is A and team B is the best team, well, he’s in a d ifficult bracket – or his team is. A “tournament” is just another name for a competiti on to determine who is the best person in this game, whatever the competition is about.

Irene says, “I thought it (meaning the tournament) was a double-elimination tournament.”  There are different kinds of tourname nts – different kinds of competitions to determine who is the best team or p layer.  One kind is called a “double-elimination.”  “Elimination” is when you lo se and are out of the tournament.  That is, you can no longer go forward.   Now my example of the

eight teams is what we would call a “single-elimina tion” tournament.  That is, if you lose once that’s it, you don’t play anymore.  I n a double-elimination tournament it’s more complicated.  You actually hav e to lose two games before you are eliminated from the tournament; that’s doub le-elimination.

Kent says yes, it is a double-elimination tournamen t.  He says, “That’s the only reason they (meaning his team) is not out of conten tion for the title.”  “To be in contention” (contention) means that you can still w in; it’s still possible for you to be the champion – the best player.  “To be out of c ontention” is the opposite; it’s to be eliminated from the tournament or to be in a place where you can no longer win first place.  Kent says that his team is not ou t of contention for the title.  The “title” here just means the winning position, first  place, number one.  “Title” has some other meanings in English as well; take a look  at our Learning Guide for those.

So Irene then asks, “Why did the organizers (the pe ople who organized or put the tournament together) get rid of (or eliminate) the round-robin rounds?” “Round-robin” (robin) is another kind of tournament ; we’ve talked about single- elimination and double-elimination.  A “round-robin ” tournament is where all of the teams play each other.  So A plays B, A plays C , A plays D, A plays E, F, G, and H; all of the teams play each other.  It’s a mu ch longer kind of tournament, and usually only works when there are a smaller gro up of teams and when you have a lot of time.

Kent says, “I think it’s because they wanted to cut  down on the number of games overall.”  What Kent is saying is that he believes the organizers eliminated the round-robin rounds – that is, they got rid of them – because they wanted to decrease or cut down on the number of games overall .  “Overall” here means the total number of games.  But then he says, “I’m not sure.”

Irene says, “Your team is the defending champion.”  The “champion” is the winner, the number one position, the person who win s the tournament. “Defending” here means the person or the team that won it last time or last year. So if the Dodgers win the World Series – my favorit e baseball team – next year they would be the defending champions because they won it last year. Unfortunately, they haven’t won it since I think li ke 1988, so they are not exactly defending champions!  But if they did win last year , then they would be the defending champions this year, and if they win this  year they would be the defending champions next year, and so forth.  Irene  asks, “What happened this year?  Why aren’t they ranked higher?”  That is, wh y isn’t his team ranked or put into a higher position in the tournament.  “Rank” h ere is related to the idea of being seeded in a tournament.

 Kent says, “They didn’t have a very good season.”  A “season” is the period of time when games are played for that particular spor t.  The football season is from, I don’t know, late August to, say, January.  The American baseball season is from April to October.  Those are the months or the time periods when the teams play.  Kent said, “There were a lot of injuri es (meaning a lot of players got hurt), and as the coach, I had some run-ins with a couple of the new players.”  A “run-in” is a disagreement with someone, a fight wi th someone.  “I had a run-in with my boss the other day.”  That means I had a di sagreement or an argument with my boss.  Kent says he had a run-in with a cou ple of the new players on the team.  He says, “Let’s just say we had some clashes  in personality.”  The expression “let’s just say” is used when we don’t want to give the person a lot of information about the topic; we don’t want to give them a lot of details, so we’re trying to make a general statement – a summary stat ement about what happened.  Kent says, “Let’s just say we had some c lashes in personality.”  A “clash” (clash) is an argument or disagreement betw een two people who have different opinions or beliefs about something.  “Cl ash” has a number of other meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for som e additional explanations. And of course, The Clash was a famous punk rock gro up back in the late 70s- early 80s when I was a young person, many years ago .

Irene says, “Isn’t there a game this afternoon?”  K ent says, “Yeah (yes), but I have to feed my team first (he has to give them som e food).  They won’t play until they get what they want.”  Irene says, “What do they want?”  Kent says, “Ice cream.  Who knew six-year-olds could be so demandin g?”  “To be demanding” means to need a lot of special attention and care, which usually creates a lot of work for other people to take care of you.  Of cour se, we find out that the team that Kent is coaching is not an adult team; it’s a group of six-year-old children.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Irene:  How is your team doing in the standings?

Kent:  They’re seeded sixth and they’re in a bracke t with one of the best teams in the tournament.  Our team has already lost to them.

Irene:  I thought it was a double-elimination tourn ament.

Kent:  It is.  That’s the only reason they’re not o ut of contention for the title.

Irene:  Why did the organizers get rid of the round -robin rounds?

Kent:  I think it’s because they wanted to cut down  on the number of games overall.  I’m not sure.

Irene:  Your team is the defending champion.  What happened this year?  Why aren’t they ranked higher?

# Admiring Someone from Afar

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 742: Admiring Someone from Afar.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 742.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is called “Admiring Someone from Afar. ”  When you see someone that you like at a distance, that’s what we’re talk ing about here.  It’s going to be about love, of course.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Perry:  Look at her!  What I wouldn’t give to get a  date with her.

Lynn:  You should go talk to her and ask her for he r number.

Perry:  No way!  She’s completely out of my league.   See that guy she’s talking to?  He’s the kind of guy who’ll get her number.

Lynn:  That guy has nothing on you.  The only thing  that guy has that you don’t is confidence.

Perry:  See?  She’s giving him her number.  I don’t  have a chance.

Lynn:  But look what he’s doing with it.  He’s thro wing it away.  What a jerk!  Wait here.

Perry:  Hey, where are you going?

Lynn:  I’ve got it.  Here it is.  Here’s her number .  Call her.

Perry:  Call her?!  Out of the blue?  You’re crazy.   She’ll think I’m some kind of creep.

Lynn:  No, she’ll think you’re being bold.  She’ll love that.

Perry:  What am I supposed to say to her?  “Hi, I s tole your phone number and I’d like a date.”

Lynn:  No, tell her the truth.  Tell her you saw he r, admired her from afar, and wanted to ask her out.

Perry:  What if she asks me how I got her number?

Lynn:  Tell her you’ll tell her that when you see h er on your first date.  You’ll come off as mysterious.  She’ll eat it up.

Perry:  I can’t do it.  There’s no way I could do t hat, could I?

Lynn:  Yes you can.  After all, no guts, no glory!

[end of dialogue]

Perry begins our dialogue by saying to Lynn, “Look at her!  What I wouldn’t give to get a date with her.”  The expression “what I wo uldn’t give” means that you want something very much; you’re willing to do a lo t in order to get it.  Perry sees this woman, obviously a beautiful woman, and wants to have a date with her.  A “date” is a meeting between two people who may be r omantically interested in each other, although we use the word “date” sometim es for other meanings as well.  “Date” can mean the day on the calendar, the  month and day and year of something.  It can also be used sometimes for a non -romantic meeting, but here it’s definitely a meeting that Perry would like to be romantic.

Lynn says, “You should go talk to her and ask her f or her number.”  Her “number” is, of course, her telephone number.  Now this is t he obvious thing that a woman might say to a man.  But a man – most men, anyway, are somewhat afraid of going up and talking to a strange woman, so Perry r eplies, “No way (meaning absolutely not)!  She’s completely out of my league  (league).”  The expression “to be out of your league” means that someone or someth ing is too good or of such high quality that you don’t feel you are worthy.  W hen you say a woman is out of your league, you would mean she’s so beautiful, she ’s so attractive that she would not be interested in someone as ugly as you –  well, as ugly as me!  Well this, of course, is an excuse for Perry not to go t alk to her.  He says, “See that guy she’s talking to?”  Apparently, this beautiful woman is talking to another man. “He’s the kind of guy who’ll get her number.”  He’s  the sort of person – the sort of man who will be able to get her to give him her num ber.

Lynn says, “That guy has nothing on you.”  The expr ession “to have nothing on (someone)” means that you are as good as that perso n; that person has no advantages over you.  Lynn says, “The only thing th at guy has that you don’t is confidence.”  “Confidence” is the feeling that you are able to do something because you have the ability.  Speaking in English as a foreign language or a second language requires confidence.  If you have c onfidence, usually you’ll speak better.

Well, poor Perry doesn’t have confidence in himself .  Perry says, “See?  She’s giving him her number.  I don’t have a chance.”  I don’t have any way I can be successful.  Lynn says, “But look what he’s doing w ith it.  He’s throwing it away.” “To throw (something) away” means to put it in the trash; to dispose of it, we might say.  It can also be used to mean to waste an  opportunity.  But here it means, I think, that he’s taking the piece of paper  and he’s putting it in a trashcan.  Lynn says, “What a jerk!  Wait here.”  “ What a jerk” is Lynn describing this other man, and so she tells Perry to wait wher e he is.  Perry says, “Hey, where are you going?”  Lynn says, “I’ve got it.  He re it is.  Here’s her number. Call her.”  So Lynn goes over and picks up the tele phone number that the other man threw away and tells Perry to call her.  Well, this is rather strange.  Perry says, “Call her?!  Out of the blue?”  The expressio n “out of the blue,” like the color blue (blue), means unexpectedly, without warn ing, for something to happen without any indication that it was going to happen.   This woman, of course, doesn’t even know Perry, may not have even seen him , so if he calls her it would be completely unexpected; it would be out of the bl ue.  Perry says, “You’re crazy.”  I think Perry’s right; Lynn is a little cr azy here.  I mean, he doesn’t even know this woman, the woman doesn’t even know who he  is.  Perry says, “She’ll think I’m some kind of creep.”  A “creep” (creep) i s the same as a jerk.  It’s a negative way of describing someone who behaves in a  bad or very unlikable way.

Lynn says, “No, she’ll think you’re being bold.”  “ To be bold” (bold) means to be confident, to have courage, to show an ability to t ake risks, not to be fearful. Lynn says, “She’ll love that.”  Perry says, “What a m I supposed to say to her? ‘Hi, I stole your phone number and I’d like a date. ’”  “Stole” (stole) is the past tense of “steal” (steal), which means to rob someon e, to take something that isn’t yours.  Perry says that he can’t really call up thi s woman and say that he stole her telephone number.  Lynn says, “No, tell her the  truth.  Tell her that you saw her, admired her from afar, and wanted to ask her o ut.”  “To admire (someone)” means to like them very much, to respect them very much.  It doesn’t have a romantic meaning in all cases: you can admire a pre sident, you can admire a famous person, you could admire your parents, peopl e that you respect.  We sometimes use the phrase “to look up to.”  “I look up to my father.”  I think he’s a

great man; I admire him.  It can also be used in the sense of thinking that someone is beautiful; that’s how Lynn is using it h ere.  She says he should tell this woman that he admired her from afar (afar).  “ Afar” means at a distance, from a distance, far away.  Lynn says he should ask  her out.  “To ask (someone) out” means to ask them to go on a date with you, a romantic date.

Perry says, “What if she asks me how I got her numb er?”  Lynn responds, “Tell her you’ll tell her when you see her on your first date.  You’ll come off as mysterious.  She’ll eat it up.”  “To come off as” m eans to make other people believe a certain thing, to see you in a certain wa y, to leave a certain impression on someone.  “He came off as an intelligent person, ” that is the impression that I got from him, that is my idea of him from that situ ation or that encounter.  “He came off as a jerk,” that would be a very negative way of describing your impression of someone, or “a creep.”  Well, Lynn th inks that Perry will come off as “mysterious,” something or someone that is diffi cult to understand or identify. She says this woman will eat it up.  “To eat it up”  means to accept something eagerly, usually because you want to believe it.  I t’s something that you believe perhaps already and so when someone tells you, you accept it very quickly.

Perry says, “I can’t do it.  There’s no way I could  do that, could I?”  Lynn says, “Yes you can.  After all, no guts, no glory!”  This  is an old expression, “no guts (guts), no glory (glory).”  “Guts” is courage, stre ngth, bravery.  “Glory” is something wonderful that happens, something that yo u want to happen that will give you great pleasure or perhaps great fame.  So the expression “no guts, no glory” means that if you don’t take any risks, if y ou’re not brave and courageous, then you won’t gain anything; you won’t be able to get something that you want. There’s another expression, “no pain, no gain,” mea ning in order to get something good you often have to go through some pa in.  And certainly, asking a woman out on a date, for a man, can be pretty painf ul!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Perry:  Look at her!  What I wouldn’t give to get a  date with her.

Lynn:  You should go talk to her and ask her for he r number.

Perry:  No way!  She’s completely out of my league.   See that guy she’s talking to?  He’s the kind of guy who’ll get her number.

Lynn:  That guy has nothing on you.  The only thing  that guy has that you don’t is confidence.

Perry:  See?  She’s giving him her number.  I don’t  have a chance.

Lynn:  But look at what he’s doing with it.  He’s t hrowing it away.  What a jerk! Wait here.

Perry:  Hey, where are you going?

Lynn:  I’ve got it.  Here it is.  Here’s her number .  Call her.

Perry:  Call her?!  Out of the blue?  You’re crazy.   She’ll think I’m some kind of creep.

Lynn:  No, she’ll think you’re being bold.  She’ll love that.

Perry:  What am I supposed to say to her?  “Hi, I s tole your phone number and I’d like a date.”

Lynn:  No, tell her the truth.  Tell her you saw he r, admired her from afar, and wanted to ask her out.

Perry:  What if she asks me how I got her number?

Lynn:  Tell her you’ll tell her that when you see h er on your first date.  You’ll come off as mysterious.  She’ll eat it up.

Perry:  I can’t do it.  There’s no way I could do t hat, could I?

Lynn:  Yes you can.  After all, no guts, no glory!

[end of dialogue]

Well, she comes off as mysterious; she’s admired fr om afar; that’s because no one knows what she looks like.  It’s our own script writer, Dr. Lucy Tse.  Thanks, Lucy!





# Writing a Story

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 743: Writing a Story.

This episode is a dialogue between Xavier and Sara;  it’s called “Writing a Story.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Xavier:  How’s your novel coming along?

Sara:  It’s not.  I abandoned it for now.  I think I bit off more than I can chew. Now, I’m working on a short story.

Xavier:  That sounds interesting.  Who are the main  characters?

Sara:  I’m not sure yet.  Character development is really important so I need to give the characters themselves some serious thought .

Xavier:  Okay, tell me about the general plot.  Is it an adventure, romance, horror story – what?

Sara:  I haven’t decided that either.

Xavier:  All right.  What about the setting?  Is it  going to be set in the U.S.?

Sara:  Hmm, that’s still up in the air, too.  I’m t hinking of writing a period story, but I’m not sure what time period to choose.  That’ll h elp decide the actual setting.

Xavier:  I’m guessing you haven’t decided the point  of view of the story either, whether it’ll be told in the first person or third person, am I right?

Sara:  You are.  I know.  I have a lot to think abo ut.

 Xavier:  You’ve definitely got your work cut out for you.

Sara:  I know.  I’m just waiting for some inspirati on.

Xavier:  Good luck with that.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Xavier saying to Sara, “Ho w’s your novel coming along?”  A “novel” is a long, fictional story, a st ory that is not true.  “To be coming along” means to be progressing.  So, Xavier is aski ng Sara how her novel is progressing.  Is it getting finished?  Sara says, “ It’s not (it’s not coming along).  I abandoned it for now.”  “To abandon” (abandon) mean s to give up on something completely.  Well, Sara has not given up on it comp letely, that’s why she says, “I abandoned it for now,” meaning maybe in the future she’ll come back to it.  She says, “I think I bit off more than I can chew.”  Th is is a common expression: “to bite off more than you can chew.”  “To bite” means to use your teeth to remove usually a piece of food.  For example, if you are e ating chicken and you are holding the piece of chicken by your two hands, you  might bite off a piece.  The difference between “to bite” and “to bite off” has to do with separating the piece with your mouth; you remove it completely from wher e it was.  You could bite something; you could bite your finger, but you woul dn’t be removing it from your hand – well, unless you bit it very strongly.  The expression here in the dialogue however is “I bit (bit) off.”  “Bit” is the irregul ar past tense for “bite.”  So, “I bit off more than I can chew.”  “To chew” is to use your te eth to break down food into smaller pieces so you can swallow it.  “To bite off  more than you can chew,” however, as an expression, means to try to do somet hing that you are not completely able to do or even capable of doing.  Sa ra says, “Now, I’m working on a short story,” which is also a work of fiction; a story, but not a long one that you would publish as a book.

Xavier says, “That sounds interesting.  Who are the  main characters?”  A “character” in a novel is one of the people in the novel.  Sara says, “I’m not sure yet.  Character development is really important so I need to give the characters themselves some serious thought.”  “Character devel opment” is the way that a person in a novel, a play, a movie changes over tim e in the story itself.  Sara says she’s going to give this “some serious thought ” meaning she’s going to think about it seriously for a long time.  Xavier says, “ Okay, tell me about the general plot.”  A “plot” (plot) is the main events in a nov el, play, or movie; we might call it the main storyline.  First this happens, then this happens, then this happens.

Boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl get married.  That’s the basic plot for a lot of romantic movies and books.

Xavier wants to know about the general plot of Sara ’s book, so he gives her some examples, some kinds of books, what we would c all some “genres”: adventure, romance, horror story.  He asks which of  these his friend’s story is. Well, an “adventure story” is a story that is excit ing; there are many usually dangerous activities or experiences in the story.  You can think of a movie like Indiana Jones , the series of movies, those were adventure movies .  “Romance” is boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy a nd girl get married; that’s the general idea of a romance story usually.  “Horror s tory” (horror) is a novel or a movie that has something scary or frightening.  The  Silence of the Lambs  was kind of a horror movie.  Usually, horror movies hav e a lot of blood nowadays, movies with people who get their heads cut off, and  that sort of thing.  I don’t really like horror stories.  I like adventures.  Ro mance, eh, not so much.

Sara says, “I haven’t decided that either,” meaning  she doesn’t know what kind of story she’s going to write.  Xavier says, “All righ t.  What about the setting?  Is it going to be set in the U.S.?”  The “setting” of a s tory has to do with the time and the place where the story takes place, the location  and the period of time.  Is it in the 1980s in England?  Is it in Scotland in the 140 0s?  What’s the setting?  The question that Xavier asks is “Is it going to be set  in the U.S.?” meaning is it going to take place in the United States.

Sara says, “Um, that’s still up in the air, too.”  When we say something is “up in the air” we mean it’s undecided, we’re not sure yet , we haven’t determined that yet.  Someone may say, “Our plans are up the air, w e don’t know what we’re going to be doing tomorrow.”  Perhaps we’ll be in a  beautiful balloon!  Sara doesn’t know what her setting is going to be.  She says, “I’m thinking of writing a period story, but I’m not sure what time period to choose.”  A “period story” is a story that takes place at some time in the past; it ’s not a story about what’s happening today.  It might be about England in the 19 th  century or Rome at the time of Julius Caesar; those would be period storie s, or period pieces they might be called.

Sara isn’t sure what period she’s going to write in .  She says, “That will help decide the actual setting.”  Xavier says, “I’m gues sing you haven’t decided the point of view of the story either, whether it’ll be  told in the first person or third person, am I right?”  The “point of view” is the vi ew or perspective from which a story can be told.  Usually a story is told either in the first person, meaning you read the story from someone’s viewpoint; they say “ I.”  “I walked into a room and I saw a beautiful woman and I said, ‘Can I have you r phone number?’ and she

said, ‘No.  Get out of here.  You’re ugly!’”  That would be a first person story. That’s kind of what my romance story would probably  be!  A third person story is the story being told not by one of the characters i n the book, but, if you will, by some person outside of the book.  “He walked into t he room, he saw a beautiful woman.  He said, ‘Hey baby.  How ya doing?’”  That would be a third person story.  That would never happen to me!  So, first p erson is “I,” a character is telling the story from their own perspective – thei r own point of view.  Third person is someone else’s point of view.  The story that Sara is writing is still undetermined in terms of its point of view.  She sa ys, “You are,” you are right, I don’t know.  “I know I have a lot to think about,” she says.

Xavier says, “You definitely got your work cut out for you.”  “To have your work cut out for you” means to be required to complete s omething that is going to be very difficult; you have a very difficult task, a v ery difficult problem to solve.  Sara says, “I know.  I’m just waiting for some inspirati on.”  “Inspiration” is something that occurs to you that stimulates your mind to do or to feel something.  When we talk about creative people – artists, writers, pain ters – sometimes they’ll talk about their inspiration.  A man may paint a picture  of a beautiful woman; he was inspired by some woman in his life perhaps.  Sara i s waiting for some inspiration. Xavier says, “Good luck with that.”  That’s kind of  a comical expression nowadays.  When someone says, “Oh, good luck with t hat,” they mean you probably won’t be able to do that, or I doubt you w ill be able to do that.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Xavier:  How’s your novel coming along?

Sara:  It’s not.  I abandoned it for now.  I think I bit off more than I can chew. Now, I’m working on a short story.

Xavier:  That sounds interesting.  Who are the main  characters?

Sara:  I’m not sure yet.  Character development is really important so I need to give the characters themselves some serious thought .

Xavier:  Okay, tell me about the general plot.  Is it an adventure, romance, horror story – what?

Sara:  I haven’t decided that either.

Xavier:  All right.  What about the setting?  Is it  going to be set in the U.S.?

Sara:  Hmm, that’s still up in the air, too.  I’m t hinking of writing a period story, but I’m not sure what time period to choose.  That’ll h elp decide the actual setting.

Xavier:  I’m guessing you haven’t decided the point  of view of the story either, whether it’ll be told in the first person or third person, am I right?

Sara:  You are.  I know.  I have a lot to think abo ut.

Xavier:  You definitely got your work cut out for y ou.

Sara:  I know.  I’m just waiting for some inspirati on.

Xavier:  Good luck with that.

This episode is a dialogue between Jenny and her bo ss about making mistakes. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Boss:  What is going on here?!

Jenny:  There was a miscommunication.

Boss:  A miscommunication?!  There are 16 copiers i n this office.  Who ordered 16 copiers?

Jenny:  No one did.  Clearly wires got crossed some where.  I’ll try to get to the bottom of this, but the copiers will be removed bef ore lunch.

Boss:  I can’t even walk to my office with all of t hese machines in here.  How am I supposed to get any work done?

Jenny:  I’m looking for the purchase order right no w to see if the mistake was on our end or on their end.

Boss:  Let me know as soon as you figure it out.  I  want to know who’s responsible for this.

Jenny:  Right, I’ll let you know.  No doubt it was just a clerical error.  No harm, no foul.

Boss:  No harm, no foul?!  This screw up has cost m e half a day’s productivity.  I think that’s plenty of harm done.

Jenny:  You’re right, sir.  I stand corrected.  I’m  sure it was just an honest mistake.

Boss:  Stop making excuses for the person responsib le for this debacle.  Jenny, why  are you making excuses for the person responsible?

Jenny:  You look thirsty.  I’ll go get you some cof fee right now!

[end of dialogue]

The title of this episode is “Dealing With a Mistak e.”  “To deal with” means to handle, to take care of, and Jenny and her boss nee d to deal with a mistake

The boss asks Jenny, somewhat angrily, “What is going on here?!”  What is happening here?  Jenny says, “There was a miscommun ication.”  A “miscommunication” is a nice way, a polite way of s aying that somehow two people didn’t understand each other.  One person th ought there was one meaning, the other person thought it meant somethin g else, and so the two of them did not properly communicate.

The boss says, again somewhat angrily, “A miscommun ication?!  There are 16 copiers in this office.  Who ordered 16 copiers?”  A “copier” is also called a “photocopier,” many people call it a “Xerox machine .”  Xerox is a company that makes photocopiers, or at least they used to.  In a ny case, there’s a problem here.  The boss says there are now 16 of these copi ers in the office.  Jenny says, “No one did.  Clearly wires got crossed somewhere.”   To say that your “wires got crossed” is an old expression meaning there was som e sort of mistake, but it was due to some misunderstanding – some miscommunicatio n, and no one is really at fault.  That’s the idea; no one is really to bla me.  This probably comes from the old days when telephone lines would get connected a ccidentally to each other perhaps, I don’t know, and you would hear someone e lse’s communication.  Well here, the wires got crossed and they did not commun icate properly.

Jenny says, “I’ll try to get to the bottom of this,  but the copiers will be removed before lunch.”  She’s going to get rid of or remove  the copying machines before lunchtime.  She’s also going to get to the bottom of this.  That expression, “to get to the bottom of (something),” means to research an d investigate something to find the real reason, the real explanation.  When y ou find out about a problem and it seems complicated, and you don’t know the re ason for the problem you

might use this expression.  “I’m going to get to the bottom of this issue, why my car wasn’t finished on time.”  I’m going to talk to  the mechanic, I’m going to talk to the mechanic’s boss, and so forth.  I’m going to re search – investigate – till I find an answer.

The boss says, “I can’t even walk to my office with  all of these machines in here. How am I supposed to get any work done?”  You see, Jenny is trying to make her boss happy, but the boss keeps talking about the problem.  If he stopped talking, maybe he would get some work done!  Right Jenny?  Am I right, huh? Exactly.

Anyway, Jenny says, “I’m looking for the purchase o rder right now to see if the mistake was on our end or on their end.”  A “purcha se order” is a document used in businesses that are buying something from anothe r business, and they say, well, here’s our order, here’s what we want, and a purchase order is considered official approval.  It’s almost like a contract tha t says we will pay you this amount of money if you give us these things.  The person w ho sells to a company is called a “vendor.”  Usually, the purchase order has  a number on it, and that’s how they keep track of it, that’s how they know whi ch order it was.  Jenny says that she’s going to look at the purchase order for the copiers to see if the mistake was on our end.  “On our end” means if it was our r esponsibility, if it was something that the company did, instead of “on thei r end,” which would be the seller or the vendor; it was their mistake.

The boss says, “Let me know as soon as you figure it out (that is, as soon as you understand and solve this problem).  I want to know  who’s responsible for this.” “Who’s responsible” means who is the person who was  in charge, and therefore if something goes wrong has to take the blame.  Tha t is, has to accept the responsibility: “Yes, it was my fault.”  For exampl e in a marriage, it’s always the husband who is responsible for any problems or any mistakes.  And if you understand that, gentlemen, your life will be much easier!

Well, Jenny is trying to understand who’s responsib le for this error.  She says, “Right, I’ll let you know.  No doubt it was just a clerical error.”  “Clerical” refers to doing paperwork, adding numbers, typing; these are all considered clerical tasks. A “clerical error” means it’s an unimportant error caused by someone who wasn’t paying attention.  They didn’t mean to make a mista ke, it was just like a small accident.  That’s why Jenny says, “No harm, no foul .”  This expression is used when we recognize that something bad has happened, but it isn’t very serious. For example you’re driving, and you stop at a stop sign, and a car behind you bumps you – hits you very lightly.  You get out, yo u see that he did hit you, but there doesn’t appear to be any problem with your ca r; there’s no damage.  You

might say, “Well, okay.  No harm, no foul.”  Yes, y ou hit me, but there isn’t any serious damage and therefore it’s no big deal.

The boss doesn’t like this attitude by Jenny.  He s ays, “No harm, no foul?!  This screw up has cost me half a day’s productivity.”  A  “screw up” is a noun; it can also be a verb, “to screw up.”  As a noun, it means  a bad mistake.  As a verb, it means to make a bad mistake, something that has con sequences; that is, something that does cause some damage – some proble ms.  The problem here, the boss says, is that it has cost him a half a day ’s productivity.  “Productivity” is the amount of work that you can complete in a certa in period of time, and it’s used generally here to mean getting a lot of things  done.  By the way, I should mention the word “screw” has a number of different meanings in English, not all of which are covered in our Learning Guide for this  episode.  The boss says, “I think that’s plenty of harm done,” meaning yes, the re was harm because of this mistake.

Jenny says, “You’re right, sir.”  Notice she calls him “sir.”  He’s angry; she’s trying to show respect to him.  She says, “I stand correct ed.”  This is a common expression.  “I stand corrected” means that you rec ognize that what you said was wrong and that the other person is right.  So that husband says to the wife, “Honey, my dear.  I think we need to go to my broth er’s house tonight,” and the wife says, “Oh, no.  I told you I’m not going.  Rem ember?” and the husband, who of course doesn’t remember, says, “Oh, yes.  I reme mber.  I stand corrected.” You see how that works?  Okay, good.  Well, that’s how it works with Jenny and her boss.  She says, “I’m sure it was just an hones t mistake.”  An “honest mistake” is an error that was made by accident.  It  wasn’t someone trying to cause problems, it was just one of those things tha t happened by accident.

The boss says, “Stop making excuses for the person responsible for this debacle.”  “To make excuses” means to give a reason  or an explanation for why something happened, usually because you want to avo id the other person getting angry or you don’t want to be punished yourself.  “ To make excuses” is to say, “Well, okay.  Yes, I made a mistake, but the reason  was because my friend told me something that wasn’t true, and then I talked to  my other friend, and she said…” and so forth.  You’re trying to give reasons  why you made your mistake to make you seem less guilty.  Well, that’s what the boss does not want Jenny to do.  She is making excuses, he says, for this debac le.  “Debacle” (debacle) is a huge failure, a serious problem caused by some big mistake.  Then the boss says, “Jenny, why  are you making excuses for the person responsible? ”  Jenny says, trying to change the subject – trying to get the boss to think about something else says, “You look thirsty.  I’ll go ge t you some coffee right now!” This is something that an employee might do for the ir boss to try to make the

boss happy.  Of course, we suspect that Jenny made the mistake, and that’s why she’s trying to, we would use the expression, “play  it down,” that is, not make a big deal of it, say that it is no big deal, it wasn ’t important, and so forth.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Boss:  What is going on here?!

Jenny:  There was a miscommunication.

Boss:  A miscommunication?!  There are 16 copiers i n this office.  Who ordered 16 copiers?

Jenny:  No one did.  Clearly wires got crossed some where.  I’ll try to get to the bottom of this, but the copiers will be removed bef ore lunch.

Boss:  I can’t even walk to my office with all of t hese machines in here.  How am I supposed to get any work done?

Jenny:  I’m looking for the purchase order right no w to see if the mistake was on our end or on their end.

Jenny:  You’re right, sir.  I stand corrected.  I’m  sure it was just an honest mistake.

# Welcoming a Houseguest

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 745: Welcoming a Houseguest.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 745.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development right here in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Yeah, t hat’s where we are!

We have a website, it’s eslpod.com.  Go there and b ecome a member already, will ya?  You can get our Learning Guide, and help support this podcast.  You can also follow us on Twitter.  Wow, yeah, we’re on  Twitter!  You can go to @eslpod on Twitter and get all the cool news.

This is an episode about welcoming a “houseguest,” someone who is going to be staying at your house: a friend, a family member, t hat sort of thing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Yousef:  Why are you rearranging the furniture?

Rachel:  My Aunt Susan called and she’s coming for a visit.  It’ll be so nice to see her.  It’s been a while since we’ve had a housegues t.

Yousef:  Your crazy Aunt Susan?  The one who talks to herself all the time and makes funny noises?

Rachel:  Don’t be like that.  She’s a little eccent ric, but she has a heart of gold.

Yousef:  How long is she staying?

Rachel:  She was a little vague about that.  We’ll just play it by ear.

Yousef:  I don’t like the sound of that.  Open-ende d invitations are a bad idea.

Rachel:  She won’t outstay her welcome.  As far as I’m concerned, she can stay for as long as she wants.  You don’t mind, do you?

Yousef:  Speak for yourself.  I don’t like having h ouseguests.  They hog the TV and I can’t walk around the house in my underwear.  I feel restricted.

Rachel:  That’s a small price to pay for her intere sting company, don’t you think? We’ll have so much fun listening to her stories.

Yousef:  I think you’re making some unwarranted ass umptions here.  First, you assume that I enjoy her company.  Second, you assum e that I’ll be here.

Rachel:  What do you mean?  You won’t be here next week?

Yousef:  Next week, I’ll be visiting my brother in Toronto.  Didn’t I already mention it?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins when Yousef says to Rachel, “Wh y are you rearranging the furniture?”  “To rearrange” means to change the pos ition of different objects; we especially use this verb with furniture: coaches, c hairs, desks, sofas, that sort of thing.  To rearrange them means to put them in diff erent places in the room.

Rachel says, “My Aunt Susan (you could also say ‘My  Aunt Susan,’ either pronunciation is correct) called and she’s coming f or a visit.  It’ll be so nice to see her.  It’s been a while since we’ve had a housegues t.”  A “houseguest” is a person who stays in your home for a certain amount of time, usually a friend or a family member.

Yousef says, “Your crazy Aunt Susan?  The one who t alks to herself all the time and makes funny noises?”  “To talk to yourself” is to speak quietly to yourself without expecting anyone to be listening or anyone to answer you.  Sometimes that’s considered a sign of a crazy person, a perso n who is mentally ill; they talk to themselves, when, in truth, almost everyone talk s to themselves.  I talk to myself.  We don’t tell other people we talk to ours elves, but it’s part of the thinking process I think.  We all do it.

Anyway, Yousef thinks that the aunt is crazy.  Rach el says, “Don’t be like that.” The expression “don’t be like that” is used when yo u are asking someone to stop behaving in a certain way; you are not happy with t he way they are talking or acting.  Rachel says her aunt is a little eccentric .  “Eccentric” (eccentric) means a little unusual, something that is a little strange,  not normal.  It’s not a sign of being crazy.  It’s a way that we may describe someo ne who acts very differently, not the way other people act in that society, but t hey’re not mentally ill, we might just say they’re eccentric.  This aunt of Rachel’s is eccentric, but she has a heart of gold.  To say someone “has a heart of gold” is t o mean they’re very nice; they’re very friendly; they’re good people.

 Yousef says, “How long is she staying?”  How long w ill she be at our house? Rachel says, “She was a little vague about that.”  “To be vague” (vague) means that you aren’t very clear; you aren’t very precise .  “What time are you going to be at the party?”  “Oh, maybe two, three, possibly four.”  You’re being very vague; you’re not giving a direct, specific answer.   Rachel says, “We’ll just play it by ear.”  That’s a popular expression.  “To play it  by ear” means to do what feels right at the moment.  You don’t have a plan, you’re  just going to sort of make up your plan as you go along, so it may change every h our; you may decide to do something different.  You’re playing it by ear; you ’re not making a plan.  It probably comes from music, where you hear a song, a nd you don’t have what we would call the “sheet music,” a piece of paper with  the notes written on it, so you have to play it just by listening to it.  I’m guess ing that’s where it comes from, but what do I know?  I’m not a musician.  I can’t sing,  anyway!

Yousef says, “I don’t like the sound of that.  Open -ended invitations are a bad idea.”  “Open-ended” means there isn’t a clear end or, in this case, a clear answer.  You don’t know when something is going to end.  If you have an open- ended commitment to someone it could last a week, it could last a year, you don’t know.  Yousef says that open-ended invitations are a bad idea, saying to someone, “Yes, come and stay at my house however lo ng you want,” not giving them a definite time.

Rachel says, “She won’t outstay her welcome.”  “To outstay” (outstay – one word) means to stay in someone’s home or office lon ger than that person wants you to.  You think they’re going to be there for 2 days, and instead they’re there for 20 days.  That would be outstaying your welcome .  Rachel says, “As far as I’m concerned, she can stay for as long as she want s to.  You don’t mind, do you?”  Of course, Yousef does mind; he is bothered by that.  He says, “Speak for yourself.”  We use that phrase to show that our opi nion is not the same as the opinion the person we’re talking to is expressing.  So, Rachel is saying she can stay however long she wants.  Yousef doesn’t agree;  he says, “Speak for yourself.  I don’t like having houseguests.  They h og the TV and I can’t walk around the house in my underwear.  I feel restricte d.”  “To hog (hog) (something),” as a verb, means to use it so that no  one else can use it, to use it longer than you should.  “To hog the TV” would be t o watch what you want to watch on TV, and not let anyone else use the televi sion to watch what they want. “Hog” has a couple of different meanings in English ; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.

Yousef is complaining that he won’t be able to walk  around the house in his underwear, which many people do.  He says, “I feel restricted.”  “To be restricted”

means to be unable to move freely, to be limited.  Rachel says, “That’s a small price to pay for her interesting company, don’t you  think?”  “A small price to pay” says that yes, something is going to be a little pa inful, a little unpleasant, but you’re going to get a lot back in return.  So you m ight say, “Not smoking every day is a small price to pay for living a longer lif e.”  It isn’t going to be that painful and you get a lot of benefit if you do it.  Rachel thinks that her aunt is interesting company.  “Company” can mean a business, but “compa ny” can also mean the presence of another person, someone else in the sam e room or with you somewhere.  “I’m going to keep (someone) company” i s a common expression; I’m going to go and be there with them, talk to the m, make sure they’re not alone. That’s the use of “company” that Rachel is employin g here.  She says, “We’ll have so much fun listening to her stories.”

Yousef says, “I think you’re making some unwarrante d assumptions.”  An “assumption” is something that you believe to be tr ue, but it may be wrong.  You don’t necessarily have all of the information neces sary.  “Unwarranted” means not warranted; “warranted” means justified, with a good reason.  “Unwarranted” means not justified.  You don’t have a good reason to make that assumption Yousef is saying.  “First,” he says, “you assume th at I enjoy her company. Second, you assume that I’ll be here.”  Rachel says , “What do you mean?  You won’t be here next week?”  Yousef says, “Next week,  I’ll be visiting my brother in Toronto.  Didn’t I already mention that?”  Of cours e, Yousef has decided to visit his brother because Rachel’s Aunt Susan is coming t o their house.  He, of course, wasn’t planning this when they started the conversation, but that’s how he’s going to get away from having to be in the hou se with Rachel’s aunt.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Yousef:  Why are you rearranging the furniture?

Rachel:  My Aunt Susan called and she’s coming for a visit.  It’ll be so nice to see her.  It’s been a while since we’ve had a housegues t.

Yousef:  Your crazy Aunt Susan?  The one who talks to herself all the time and makes funny noises?

Rachel:  Don’t be like that.  She’s a little eccent ric, but she has a heart of gold.

Yousef:  How long is she staying?

Rachel:  She was a little vague about that.  We’ll just play it by ear.

Yousef:  I don’t like the sound of that.  Open-ende d invitations are a bad idea.

Rachel:  She won’t outstay her welcome.  As far as I’m concerned, she can stay for as long as she wants to.  You don’t mind, do yo u?

Yousef:  Speak for yourself.  I don’t like having h ouseguests.  They hog the TV and I can’t walk around the house in my underwear.  I feel restricted.

Rachel:  That’s a small price to pay for her intere sting company, don’t you think? We’ll have so much fun listening to her stories.

Yousef:  I think you’re making some unwarranted ass umptions here.  First, you assume that I enjoy her company.  Second, you assum e that I’ll be here.

Rachel:  What do you mean?  You won’t be here next week?

Yousef:  Next week, I’ll be visiting my brother in Toronto.  Didn’t I already mention it?

# Traveling Over the Holidays

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 746: Traveling Over the Holidays.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 746.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode and take a look at some of the other course s we have our website.

This episode is called “Traveling Over the Holidays .”  It’s a dialogue between Sabrina and Ying using vocabulary that we might use  in talking about traveling during a busy season such as Christmas or Thanksgiv ing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sabrina:  You look like you’re getting ready for ba ttle.

Ying:  In a way, I am.  I’m flying home next week t o be with my family over the holidays and you know what holiday travel is like.

Sabrina:  I’ve flown during peak travel season befo re, and now, I try to avoid it at all costs.

Ying:  Well, I can’t this year, so I’m arming mysel f for the experience.  I booked my flights back in September and I have my seat ass ignment.  I’ll print out my boarding passes before I head for the airport, and I’ll keep checking the flight status to make sure the flight is on time.

Sabrina:  I hope you don’t have any tight connectio ns.

Ying:  I change planes in Chicago, but I have two h ours in between flights.  I’m hoping that’ll be enough.

Sabrina:  What’s in that huge bag?

Ying:  Those are my supplies.  If I get snowed in o r if my flight gets cancelled, I’m ready to spend the night in the airport.

Sabrina:  Wow, you really thought this out.  You’re  ready for the worst-case scenario.

Ying:  Forewarned and forearmed.  You won’t catch m e napping!

[end of dialogue]

Sabrina begins by saying, “You look like you’re get ting ready for battle.”  “Battle” (battle) is when two people, or usually two groups of people are fighting, such as two different armies from different countries; it’s  a big fight.  Sabrina says that Ying looks like he’s getting ready for battle.  Yin g says, “In a way, I am.”  “In a way” means in some manner; sort of I am.  “I’m flyi ng home next week to be with my family over the holidays (that is, during the ho lidays) and you know what holiday travel is like.”  Holiday travel in the Uni ted States usually refers to the months of November and December.  In late November we have the Thanksgiving holiday, and in December it’s the Chri stmas and Hanukkah holidays.  So when people refer to holiday travel, they’re usually talking about one of those two events.

Sabrina says, “I’ve flown during the peak travel se ason before, and now, I try to avoid it at all costs.”  “Peak” (peak) is the highe st part of something.  We can talk about the peak of the mountain.  There’s a famous p eak in Colorado called Pikes Peak.  Well, this is the peak travel season, so it’ s the busiest travel time, and that is what Sabrina is talking about.  She says that sh e’s flown, meaning she has flown in an airplane – “flown” (flown) is the past participle of the verb “to fly.”  “I fly,” “I flew,” in the past,” “I have flown.”  Well , Sabrina has flown during the travel season – the peak travel season – and now she tries  to avoid it – get away from it – at all costs.  “At all costs” means no matter what is required, regardless of how difficult or challenging it is.  “I’m going to make sure I pass my test tomorrow at all costs.”  I’ll do anything – well, almost any thing – to pass my exam.

Sabrina tries to avoid traveling during the peak tr avel season at all costs.  Ying says, “Well, I can’t this year, so I’m arming mysel f for the experience.”  “To arm” (arm) as a verb means to prepare yourself by having  all the necessary things you need.  Usually, it refers to someone who is going t o be fighting, and “to arm yourself” means to have a gun or perhaps a sword or  a knife.  In fact, we call things that you can use to harm other people – weap ons – we often call them “arms,” in the plural.  The verb “to arm,” then, me ans to have, to get yourself one of these weapons.  Of course, Ying isn’t actually b ringing a gun on the plane; that’s not allowed in most airlines.  However, he i s getting himself ready.  He says, “I booked my flights back in September and I have my seat assignment.” “To book” (book) means to make a reservation, to ma ke arrangements.  “I

booked a flight,” that’s a very common expression m eaning I made reservations on an airplane to go somewhere.  “Flights” (flights ) are trips on an airplane from one place to another.  “Be careful you get to the a irport on time so you don’t miss your flight.”  That is, you don’t miss your airplan e that is going to be leaving.  So, “flight” can mean the travel between one place and another.  Sometimes it’s used informally to mean simply the airplane that you are  getting on.  Of course, you can’t go somewhere unless you get on the airplane, so they’re related.  Ying booked his flights back in September.  “Back in” me ans way back, several months ago.  Now it’s November or December; if he’s  speaking about something that was a long time ago or a while ago, then you can use this expression “back in.”  Back in the 1960s, when I was born, there wer e no podcasts.  True!

Ying says that he has his seat assignment.  In most  airplanes they give you a specific seat to sit in.  A “seat” is like a chair on an airplane.  The airplane has different “rows,” lines of seats.  Each row has a n umber, and each seat typically has a letter.  So if you’re in 22A, you’re probably  sitting in row 22; A is usually a window seat, a seat next to the window, and so fort h.  Ying says, “I’ll print out my boarding passes before I head for the airport.”  A “boarding pass” is an official document, usually a piece of paper, although now so me airlines – some companies have cell phone apps that you can use, bu t a boarding pass is sort of like your official ticket to get onto the plane.  I t’s not the same as the ticket, but it’s basically your permission to board the plane.  “To board” means to get on an airplane.  So, Ying has his boarding passes and he’ s going to check his flight status to make sure the flight is on time.  The “st atus” of something is the state or condition, the situation involving that thing.  “Fl ight status” would be whether the plane will be leaving at the time it’s supposed to leave – on time – or whether it’s late.

Sabrina says, “I hope you don’t have any tight conn ections.”  A “connection,” when we talk about airplane travel, is when you fly  to one airport, you get off your plane, you get into a different plane, and travel t o the next airport.  So, it’s stopping in one airport on the way to another airpo rt.  So, if you’re flying from Los Angeles to New York, you may make a stop in Chicago , and you may have to change planes.  That would be called “making a conn ection.”  A “tight connection” is when you don’t have very much time t o get the next flight.  Let’s say you fly into Chicago at 12 o’clock noon, and yo u have to be on another plane leaving for Atlanta at 12:30.  Well, you only have 30 minutes to get to your next plane; that would be a very tight connection.

Ying says, “I change planes in Chicago, but I have two hours in between flights.” So, he has lots of time before his next plane will leave.  “I’m hoping that’ll be enough.”  I’m hoping that will be enough time.  Sab rina says, “What’s in that huge

bag?”  What’s in that huge piece of luggage, we mig ht also say.  Ying says, “Those are my supplies.”  “Supplies” are the things  you need to do something else; often it relates to food.  Ying says, “If I g et snowed in or my flight gets cancelled, I’m ready to spend the night at the airp ort.”  If you are “snowed in” you are unable to leave the airport because it is snowi ng so much the planes can’t take off or land; they can’t leave the ground becau se there’s too much snow.  “To have your flight canceled” means that the airplane will not go; the airline says no, we’re not going to fly that plane today.  That is h aving your flight canceled.  It’s a terrible thing; it happens, then you have to find a  new plane to get on – a new flight to take.

Sabrina says, “Wow, you really thought this out.”  “To think (something) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to spend a lot of time thinkin g about something: a problem, and how you’re going to solve it.  Sabrina says, “Y ou’re ready for the worst-case scenario.”  A “scenario” is a possible situation, s omething that might happen. “Worst-case” would be the worst possible thing that  could happen.  So for example, if you are flying and you get snowed in an d you can’t leave the airport for two days, that might be considered a worst-case  scenario, a situation that would be the worst possible one you could have.

Ying says, “Forewarned and forearmed.”  “To be fore warned” means that you know about something bad that’s going to happen bef ore it happens; someone tells you, someone warns you.  “Forearmed” means to  be armed or to be prepared before it happens.  The more common expres sion is “forewarned is forearmed,” if you know about it, then you can prep are for it.  But it’s also possible to say, as Ying says, “forewarned and fore armed,” he’s both of those things.  He knows something bad might happen and he ’s prepared.  He says, “You won’t catch me napping!”  “To nap” (nap) means  to sleep a short time usually some time in the middle of the day.  In the  afternoon, perhaps, you nap for 10 or 15 minutes.  You go into a chair or lie d own on a couch and you fall asleep.  “To catch (someone) napping,” however, mea ns to find someone who is sleeping and therefore unprepared.  So the expressi on “to catch me napping” would mean to find me unprepared, to be in a diffic ult situation and I wasn’t ready for it.  Ying says, “You won’t (you will not) catch  me napping!”  He will be, in other words, prepared.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sabrina:  You look like you’re getting ready for ba ttle.

Ying:  In a way, I am.  I’m flying home next week t o be with my family over the holidays and you know what holiday travel is like.

# Visiting a Ranch

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 747: Visiting a Ranch.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 747.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Did you know that we are on Facebook?  Oh yes, we a re!  Go to facebook.com/eslpod.  You can also follow us on Twi tter @eslpod.  And, most importantly, you can go to our website at – what el se – eslpod.com.

This episode is a dialogue between Piero and Annie.   They’re going to something called a “ranch,” basically a large farm with many different kinds of animals.  Let’s get started.  Yee-haw!

[start of dialogue]

Piero:  What’s all this?

Annie:  I’m visiting my sister and brother-in-law’s  new ranch next month and I’m getting ready for it.  I know I’m a city girl, but I plan to fit right in on that ranch and work alongside all of the other cowboys.

Piero:  Well, you look the part.  You’ve got your c owboy hat, a lasso, and are those chaps?

Annie:  Yes, of course.  How else could I ride with  them on the cattle drive?

Piero:  Cattle drive?  Are you sure it’s a working ranch?

Annie:  I think so.  Why would they buy a ranch if they don’t plan to have horses and livestock?

Piero:  Don’t ask me.  What’s all that stuff in the  bags?

Annie:  That’s all equipment I’ll need to ride a ho rse: a bridle, a bit, and ta-da – my own saddle!

Piero:  This is all stuff that they should have at the ranch already, don’t you think?

Annie:  Yes, but I’ll need to go horseback riding t his weekend to practice.

Piero:  That’s a good idea.  Have you been riding h orses long?

Annie:  This weekend will be my first time.

Piero:  You’re riding a horse for the first time th is weekend and you plan to work at your sister’s ranch next month?

Annie:  Sure, how hard could it be?  It’s just like  riding a bike, right?

[end of dialogue]

Piero begins by asking Annie, “What’s all this?”  W hat is all of this stuff?  What are all of these things?  Annie says, “I’m visiting  my sister and brother-in-law’s new ranch next month and I’m getting ready for it.”   A “ranch” is a large farm that usually has lots of cows, horses, and other large a nimals on it.  We often talk about ranches especially here in the western part of the United States, where there used to be very large amounts of land owned b y one or two people – a family typically – and they would use that land for  cows and horses and growing food.  The word “ranch” is, in American English, ty pically associated with states like Texas or Arizona or California, where there we re these large pieces of land that you would find animals on.

That’s where Annie’s going; she’s going to a ranch owned by her sister and her sister’s husband, which would be Annie’s brother-in -law.  She says, “I know I’m a city girl” – that is, she’s someone who is raised i n a city, not out on a farm, we would call that, perhaps, a “country girl” or “boy”  – “but I plan to fit right in on that ranch and work alongside all of the other cowboys.”   “To fit in” or “to fit right in” means to be the same as everyone around you.  So, y ou’re wearing same kinds of clothes, you’re acting the same, you’re doing the same things; that’s to fit in. Annie wants to work alongside all of the other cowb oys.  “Alongside” (alongside – one word) means together with someone else; doing s omething with someone, standing next to them, or working with them.  “Cowb oys” are people, usually men, that ride horses, and they take care of the co ws and other large animals when they’re riding on their horses.  Cowboys are a n important part of Western United States culture, and that’s what Annie wants to do.

Piero says, “Well, you look the part.”  The express ion “to look the part” (part) means that you look the way people expect someone t o look, to dress, to act for that particular situation.  The word “part” here re fers to an actor or an actress who is playing a certain character in a TV show or movie or play.  Someone who,

for example, is in the play Romeo and Juliet  and is playing the character of Romeo would have what we would say the “part” of Ro meo.  “I have Romeo’s part,” meaning that’s the person I’m going to be in  the movie or in the play.  “To look the part” means that you look just like that p erson should look.

Piero observes that Annie has a cowboy hat, a lasso , and chaps.  A “cowboy hat” is a very large hat; I’m sure you’ve seen one.  It is made of a thick, soft fabric, traditionally worn by men although women can wear t hem, too.  They’re very much associated with Western U.S. culture.  You’ll see them in movies about the West.  A “lasso” (lasso) is a long rope with a larg e circle on it that can be used to throw at an animal, for example, in order to catch the animal.  “Chaps” (chaps) are clothing that’s similar to a pair of pants.  Th ey’re often made of leather. They’re actually worn over your pants to protect th em while you are riding a horse.  I do not have a cowboy hat, a lasso, or cha ps, and I’ve never ridden a horse, but I’ve seen movies, so I know what they ar e.

Annie says, “Yes, of course (she has these things).   How else could I ride with them (the cowboys) on the cattle drive?”  A “cattle  drive” refers to a process where you have several cowboys who work together to  move the cows – we would also call them “cattle” (cattle) – from one p lace to another over a very long distance.  So, it’s how you would move the animals if you were moving to another ranch, for example, or if you were taking them to b e sold somewhere.

Piero is surprised, he says, “Cattle drive?  Are yo u sure it’s a working ranch?” That is, it’s a ranch that is still operational, th at is still functioning as a ranch. Annie says, “I think so.  Why would they buy a ranc h if they don’t plan to have horses and livestock?”  “Horses,” you probably know , are large animals with four legs.  “Livestock” are animals that are raised – are born and grow up on a farm – usually for food or for something the animal produc es.  Livestock could be anything from cows, sheep, pigs, goats; these are a ll possible animals that we would call “livestock” (livestock – one word).  Pie ro is asking Annie if this is, in fact, a real ranch with horses and animals.  Annie says, “I think so.”  Why would they have a ranch without these things?

Piero says, “Don’t ask me.  What’s all that stuff i n your bags?”  In your luggage, the things you use to carry your clothes when you t ravel.  Annie says, “That’s all equipment I’ll need to ride a horse: a bridle, a bi t, and ta-da – my own saddle!”  A “bridle” (bridle) is something made of leather that  you put over the horse’s head, and it allows you to control the horse more easily.   There’s another word that is also pronounced “bridal” (bridal), which refers to a woman who’s getting married; we call that woman a “bride.”  So, “bridal” would b e the adjective referring to the things related to the bride.  You wouldn’t want to put a bridle on the bride, of

course, unless perhaps you’re the future husband!  Annie says that she has a bridle and a bit (bit).  A “bit” here is a metal ba r that goes in the horse’s mouth, and is used along with the bridle to control the ho rse.  “Bit” has many meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Gui de for some of those.  The expression “ta-da” (ta-da or ta-dah) is something w e use when we are introducing something surprising, but we’re doing it in sort of a humorous way. It’s an expression that perhaps used to be used by magicians when they were about to do something surprising for the audience.  But now, we use it in a humorous, joking way to show something to someone t hat they might be surprised to see.  You want to show someone, for ex ample, your new pair of sunglasses.  So you turn around away from them, and  you put them on, and then you turn back around and you say, “Ta-da!  What do you think?”  And they say, “Oh!  They’re beautiful,” even if they’re not, beca use, of course, you don’t want to insult the person.  Right?  Well, Annie is surprisi ng Piero by saying and showing that she has a saddle (saddle).  A “saddle” is the thing that you use to put on top of the horse to sit on the horse so you don’t fall off.

Piero says, “This is all stuff that they should hav e at the ranch already, don’t you think?”  Annie says, “Yes, but I’ll need to go hors eback riding this weekend to practice.”  “Horseback (one word) riding” is when y ou ride a horse.  You get onto the horse’s back, literally, and you ride the horse ; you make it move and you go with it – usually.  I have never been horseback rid ing, and I really don’t want to go horseback riding!

Piero says, “That’s a good idea.  Have you been rid ing horses long (for a long time)?”  Annie says, “This weekend will be my first  time.”  Piero says, “You’re riding a horse for the first time this weekend and you plan to work at your sister’s ranch next month?”  Piero’s surprised since, of cou rse, Annie doesn’t have very much experience riding horses; she’s never done it before, and she wants to work on the ranch riding horses.  Annie says, “Sure , how hard could it be?”  This question is asked when we think something will not be very difficult.  She says, “It’s just like riding a bike, right?”  It’s simila r to riding a bicycle, which I don’t think it is.  But what do I know?  I’ve never ridden a ho rse.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Piero:  What’s all this?

Annie:  I’m visiting my sister and brother-in-law’s  new ranch next month and I’m getting ready for it.  I know I’m a city girl, but I plan to fit right in on that ranch and work alongside all of the other cowboys.

# Writing a Letter of Inquiry

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 748: Writing a Letter of Inquiry.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 748.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to eslpod.com today – not tomorrow, today – and become a member of ESL Podcast.  Why?  Well, you’ll be able to download ou r Learning Guide and your English will get better much faster than if you don ’t download our Learning Guide.

This episode is about writing a letter of inquiry.  That is, you’re asking a question; you’re trying to get information.  That’s normally what an “inquiry” is.  In this case, really, it is a letter asking for a job.  Let’s get  started. > I was laid off from my job three months ago.  Since  then, I’ve been pounding the pavement looking for another job.  So far, nothing has turned up, so I decided to take the bull by the horns and deliver inquiry lett ers to every company that might have a job opening. …
> Dear Ms. Smith (or the name of their personnel offi cer):
> I am writing to inquire about any job openings you may have for someone with my experience and qualifications.  I worked for six  years as a software engineer for McQ Corp. and I have extensive training and exp erience related to software development.
> I have enclosed a copy of my résumé.  I would appre ciate an opportunity to speak with you regarding any openings you may have or any consulting work your company requires.
> Thank you for your consideration, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
> Sincerely, Steve Woz …
> Our story begins when I say, “I was laid off from m y job three months ago.”  “To be laid (laid) off” means to lose your job, to be f ired, to say I’m sorry, you no longer work here.  “Since then (since that time), I ’ve been pounding the pavement looking for another job.”  “To pound (poun d) the pavement (pavement)” is an expression that means to spend a lot of time walking along the streets, especially going to different businesses o r different houses.  “Pavement” is another word for street, and “to pound” usually means to hit something hard, like with a tool called a “hammer.”  But here, you are hitting the ground with your feet; you’re pounding the pavement.  It’s a general  expression meaning to work very hard, to be looking in many different places e ither because you’re trying to sell something or because, in this case, you need a  job.

I say that so far, nothing has turned up.  “To turn  up” is a two-word – say it with me – phrasal verb meaning to appear suddenly, to su ddenly be present.  But, I’m saying that nothing has turned up, meaning I still don’t have a job, “so I decided to take the bull by the horns and deliver inquiry l etters to every company that might have a job opening.”  The expression “to take  the bull (bull) by the horns (horns)” means to do something without hesitation, even when it looks difficult or challenging, to try to take direct to control over something.  You feel your life is out of control; you need to make a strong, bold dec ision.  You’re going to take the bull by the horns; you’re going to actually do it, whatever that is, even when it seems difficult.  “Inquiry letters” are letters tha t you send to a company, asking them something; often, it’s asking for a job.  An “ inquiry” is another word for a question.  A “job opening” is when a company is try ing to find someone to work for them.  We might also call it a “vacant position ,” but “job opening” is more common.  You might ask someone, “Does your company have any openings?” That is, are they looking for people to hire – to w ork there.

Then we get to the actual letter that I write.  I b egin by saying, “Dear Ms. Smith,” or whatever the name of the personnel officer is.  “Personnel” is a word related to the employees of a company.  An “officer” would be someone who’s a boss, someone who’s in charge.  So, a “personnel officer”  is the person who is the boss of the department that hires people, that goes  out and finds people for the company and gets them to work there.  Sometimes we call it the “personnel office,” sometimes it’s called the “human resources  office.”

 My letter begins by saying, “I am writing to inquir e (to ask) about any job openings you may have for someone with my experienc e and qualifications.” Your “qualifications” are the things you know, your  education, your experience, perhaps something about you as a worker that make y ou qualified or fit for a job. You are able to do it.  So, you talk about your qua lifications, the things that show or demonstrate that you will be able to do this job .  I say that I worked for six years as a “software engineer,” someone who makes s oftware programs, for McQ Corp. and I have extensive training and experie nce related to software development.  When you have “extensive” training, y ou have a lot of it, something that would cover a long period of time an d perhaps a lot of knowledge about that area.  I don’t have a little bit of trai ning; I have extensive training.

I say then, “I have enclosed a copy of my résumé.”  “To enclose” (enclose) means to put one thing inside of something else.  I n this case, it’s a piece of paper inside an envelope.  Usually this word is use d in a written letter to indicate that there is something else in the envelope beside s the letter that you are reading; in this case, it’s a copy of my résumé (ré sumé).  A “résumé” gives a brief description of your experiences and qualifications:  where you went to school, what kind of skills, what kind of knowledge you hav e, where you worked before you applied for this job.  I then say, “I would app reciate an opportunity to speak with you regarding any openings you may have or any  consulting work your company requires.”  So, he’s saying do you have any thing that is close to my qualifications or do you have any consulting work.  “To consult” usually means to ask someone else their advice or opinion; “consulti ng” is working for companies, but just doing specific projects.  You’re there for  maybe a month, two months, six months; you’re not a permanent employee of the comp any.

I then say, “Thank you for your consideration, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.”  “Considerat ion” means the time that you spent thinking about something, especially making y our decision about someone’s proposal or request to do something.  So,  I’m thanking the person, we might say “in advance,” for taking the time to read  my letter and perhaps to call me about any job openings.  I say, “please don’t he sitate to contact me.”  “To hesitate” means to delay or wait to do something, u sually because you’re not sure if it’s a good idea that you do it.  I say, “d on’t hesitate to contact me.”  It’s not a problem; you can call me, you can email me, and s o forth.  Then I sign the letter, “Sincerely, Steve Woz.”

At the end I say, “I’m planning to personally deliv er each letter.”  Normally, letters are delivered by the Post Office; but here I say I’ m going to deliver the letter, I’m going to actually go to each of these companies, “w ith the hope of talking with

someone in the company.”  So he’s going to take the  letter to the personnel officer, but he’s going to try also to talk to othe r people in the company to see if he can find out any more information about whether they have any job openings. He says, “It is going take a lot of time and legwor k.”  “Legwork” (one word) is another word for a lot of traveling, doing a lot of  work that is difficult or boring. Sometimes we use this word even if we aren’t talkin g about walking or traveling or running – moving ourselves personally.  Sometime s we use the word to talk about the hard, somewhat difficult research or inve stigation that you have to do in order to complete a project.  I then say, “I have no intention of sitting home and twiddling my thumbs while I wait for my next job!”  To say “you have no intention of (doing something)” means you have no plans to do  that; you’re not going to do it.  I say that I don’t want to be twiddling my thu mbs.  Your “thumbs” are the short, you can think of it, finger that you have; you have  five fingers, the shortest one is the thumb.  “To twiddle” (twiddle) means to hold yo ur hands together, and “to twiddle your thumbs” means to take your thumbs and move them in small circles, one around the other.  It’s an expression, however,  that means to waste your time, not to do anything, instead just sit back, wa it, don’t worry about it.  That would be twiddling your thumbs.  I say I do not wan t to sit around and twiddle my thumbs; I want to go out and do something, and that ’s what I’m doing, trying to go to each company and deliver this letter of inqui ry.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of story]

I was laid off from my job three months ago.  Since  then, I’ve been pounding the pavement looking for another job.  So far, nothing has turned up, so I decided to take the bull by the horns and deliver inquiry lett ers to every company that might have a job opening. …

Dear Ms. Smith (or the name of their personnel offi cer):

I am writing to inquire about any job openings you may have for someone with my experience and qualifications.  I worked for six  years as a software engineer for McQ Corp. and I have extensive training and exp erience related to software development.

I’ve enclosed a copy of my résumé.  I would appreci ate an opportunity to speak with you regarding any openings you may have or any  consulting work your company requires.

Thank you for your consideration, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely, Steve Woz …

I’m planning to personally deliver each letter, wit h the hope of talking with someone in the company.  It is going take a lot of time and legwork, but I have no intention of sitting home and twiddling my thumbs w hile I wait for my next job!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 749: Getting Standard Medical Test Results.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 749.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  How are you tod ay?  Oh, just fine; thank you for asking.

This episode is a dialogue between Judith and Steve n about going to the doctor and getting some results from some tests that the d octor performs on you. Sounds like fun!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Judith:  I had my annual physical two weeks ago and  I just got a copy of the lab results, but I can’t figure out what they mean.

Steven:  Let me take a look.  The results of your b lood tests are good.  Your cholesterol is within the normal range, your glucos e levels are fine, your hormone levels are good, and your red and white blood cell counts are normal, too.

Judith:  That’s good news.

Steven:  You did well on your EKG stress test and y our bone density scan is fine.

Judith:  Really?  That’s great.  What about the oth er results?

Steven:  There appears to be no problems with your Pap smear or mammogram results, either.

Judith:  I’m really glad to hear that.  I hate goin g through those exams.  I’m glad I don’t have to do them more often.

Steven:  Just be glad you’re not a man.

Judith:  Why’s that?

Steven:  If you were a man, you’d have to have a PS A…and a DRE.

Judith:  A what?

Steven:  You don’t want to know.

[end of dialogue]

Judith has gone to the doctor, and she gets some te st results back from the doctor.  She said, “I had my annual physical two we eks ago and I just got a copy of the lab results, but I can’t figure out what the y mean.”  The word “annual” (annual) means once per year.  A “physical” is shor t for a physical examination; it’s usually something you have a doctor do once a year to check to make sure that you are healthy, that there are no new medical  problems.  Instead of “physical exam” sometimes we just say “physical”: “ I need to get a physical.” That’s what the “physical” is; it’s the examination .  “Physical” has other meanings in English as well, and those can be found in the w onderful Learning Guide for this episode.

Judith says that she got a copy of the lab results.   “Lab” (lab) is short for laboratory; it’s the place where things are tested by scientists.  And, “lab results” are the results of tests that were sent to a labora tory in order to analyze them. Steven says, “Let me take a look.”  “Let me take a look” means let me look at them; let me examine them.  He says, “The results of your blood tests are good.” “Blood tests” are when they take blood – red blood – out of you and they test it for certain problems or certain things.  Steven say s that Judith’s cholesterol is within the normal range, her glucose levels are fin e, her hormone levels are good, and her red and white blood cell counts are n ormal, also.  “Cholesterol” is a fatty substance that when it goes into your blood stream – into your arteries – it can be dangerous.  It can prevent the blood from fl owing through, at least that’s my understanding.  I’m not a real doctor of course;  I just have a Ph.D.  But, I looked it up on the Internet; I think that’s right.   A “range” (range) here means a number of numbers or levels.  One is a minimum, one  is a maximum, between which your score or the number of your test should fall.  So, we might say that, for example, if you take an intelligent quotient te st – an IQ test – the average result may be 100, but anything between, I don’t kn ow, 90 and 110 might be considered the normal range, where most people woul d be.  So, “range” has to do with a low number, a high number, and the number s in between.  The cholesterol levels of Judith are within the normal range, meaning that she’s like most people; her cholesterol isn’t too high, it isn ’t too low, it’s just right.

 “Glucose” (glucose) is a type of sugar that’s found  in the blood, and is used by the blood as – or the body, rather, as a source of energy.  So, in measuring your glucose level, the doctor is measuring the amount of that sugar, making sure it’s not too high or too low – or too sweet.  No, just k idding, not that kind of sugar. “Hormones” are substances in your body that affect a lot of different things.  They affect your sexual development, they can affect lot s of different parts of the way your body functions.  Men and women have different kinds or different levels of different hormones, and so you need to make sure yo u, uh, have the right level of the different hormones, and it sounds like Judith d oes.  She also has good red and white blood cell counts.  A “blood cell” is the  smallest unit – the smallest part of what we call blood.  A “count” is a number, how many of them are there.  If you go on a tour with the group of people, and then you  come back to the bus after the tour, the tour director – the leader – might do  a head count, might count the number of people there to make sure that everyone’s  head and body is present. Well, this is a blood cell count, finding out how m any blood cells that Judith has, and it turns out that they are in normal range as w ell.

Judith says, “That’s good news.”  Steven says, “You  did well on the EKG stress test and your bone density scan is fine.  An “EKG” is an electrocardiography test. “Stress” is normally when you are pushing your body  to do perhaps more than it normally does; “stress” can also be anxiety, nervou sness, worry.  But here, it really refers to using an exercise machine to get y our heart working so that the doctors can measure how well your heart is pumping – how well it’s working. This is called an “EKG stress test.”  A “bone densi ty scan” refers to a test where they use a machine that goes over your body.  You can keep your clothes on; you don’t have to take them off – for now!  Don’t t ake them off while listening to the podcast anyway please.  As a general rule, we a sk you to keep your clothes on while listening to the podcast.  Anyway, this, u h, machine goes over your body and it’s looking to see whether your “bones,” the h ard, white material under your skin – whether the bone has the correct amount of c ertain substances, whether they are becoming soft or not.  If they are, then t his can be an indication of problems.

So, Judith’s bone density scan was fine.  Judith sa ys, “That’s great.  What about the other results?”  Steven says, “There appears to  be no problems with your Pap (pap) smear (smear) or mammogram.”  Well, let’s  start with Pap smear.  I’ve never actually had a Pap smear; I don’t think I eve r will.  Why?  Well, it is an examination that is only done on women, and it take s a sample from their…we’ll call it their internal reproductive organs – look t hat up if you don’t know what those are on a woman – and makes sure that there is  no sign of cancer for that organ.  “Pap” stands for…something.  I don’t…I have  the word in front of me

here; I don’t how to pronounce it.  I’ve never seen  it before, I’m sorry.  It doesn’t really matter; everyone calls it a Pap smear.  A “m ammogram” (mammogram) is also something I will probably never have.  It is a n x-ray of a woman’s breasts, those things that are on the top of a woman’s chest .  It’s used to make sure the woman doesn’t have cancer in the breasts.

Steven says that her Pap smear and mammogram result s were just fine, no problems.  Judith says she’s glad to hear that.  Sh e says, “I hate going through those exams (or going to those exams).  I’m glad I don’t have to do them more often.”  Steven says, “Just be glad you’re not a ma n.”  Judith asks, “Why’s that?” Steven says, “If you were a man, you’d have to do a  PSA…and a DRE.”  Judith says, “A what?” and Steven replies, “You don’t want  to know,” meaning it’s better that I don’t tell you.  Well, I will tell you, howe ver.  PSA and DRE are exams that are typically only done on men, just like Pap smear s and mammograms are only done on women.  “PSA” stands for prostate specific antigen, and only men have a prostate.  It’s a test to make sure that the pros tate is healthy and that there is no sign of cancer.  It’s currently recommended, I b elieve, that men over the age of 50 have regular PSA examinations so that if ther e is a problem they can find it early – a problem with cancer.  A “DRE” is a digita l rectal exam.  Let’s talk about that.  “Digital” is your finger; “rectal” is, well,  when you’re sitting on the toilet the things that come out of your body come through some thing called a “rectum” (rectum).  So, “rectal” is an adjective that descri bes the rectum.  So, you put those two things together, literally your finger an d rectal, and you get the digital rectal exam, where the doctor places one of his dig its – one of his fingers – in the rectal area.  We’ll just leave it at that!

And now, we’ll listen to the dialogue at a normal s peed.

[start of dialogue]

Judith:  I had my annual physical two weeks ago and  I just got a copy of the lab results, but I can’t figure out what they mean.

Steven:  Let me take a look.  The results of your b lood tests are good.  Your cholesterol is within the normal range, your glucos e levels are fine, your hormone levels are good, and your red and white blood cell counts are normal, too.

Judith:  Why’s that?

Steven:  If you were a man, you’d have to have a PS A…and a DRE.

Judith:  A what?

Steven:  You don’t want to know.

# After Christmas Sales

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 750: After Christmas Sales.

This episode is called “After Christmas Sales,” whe n you go to the store and they reduce or lower the price to get rid of the things that people didn’t buy for the Christmas holidays.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roxana:  Get up!  We’re going to miss out on the be st deals if we don’t get to the stores when they open.

Kurt:  What?  I’m sleeping.  Leave me alone.

Roxana:  You need to get up now and come with me to  the store for the after Christmas sales.  You know that they slash prices a nd everything is on sale.

Kurt:  We just spent the past few weeks shopping for Christmas presents and now you want to shop some more?

Roxana:  We can stock up for next year.  There’ll b e deep discounts on all of the Christmas decorations and supplies, not to mention all of the winter clothing and seasonal toys.  Let’s go!

Kurt:  You go.  What do you need me for?

Roxana:  I need you to run interference while I go for the best bargains and to hold all of the bags and packages while I shop.  What else?

Kurt:  When I agreed to “for better or for worse,” I didn’t anticipate this!

[end of dialogue]

 Roxana begins by saying to Kurt, “Get up!”  “Get up ” means usually to stand up from sitting or from lying down.  Normally we use t his when we’re talking to someone who is lying in bed.  They may not be sleep ing, but they are not yet out of the bed, so we say “get up.”  You may ask someon e, “What time did you get up this morning?”  They may reply, “Well, I woke up  (meaning I went from sleeping to not sleeping) at 6:00, but I got up at 6:30; I laid in bed for a half an hour.”

So, Roxana is telling Kurt to get up.  She says, “W e’re going to miss out on the best deals if we don’t get to the stores when they open.”  “To miss out on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to not be ab le to participate in something, usually something good; to not be able to have a go od opportunity to get something, usually because you didn’t know about it  or perhaps it wasn’t possible for you to be there.  “Did you go to Bill’s birthda y party yesterday?”  “No, I missed out on that.  I had to work.”  I didn’t have the op portunity to go – besides I don’t really like Bill.  Well, you don’t have to say that .

Roxanne doesn’t want to miss out on the best deals.   A “deal” (deal) is another term for a “bargain” (bargain), that’s when the pri ce of something is lower than it is normally.  I was telling my wife the other day t hat they had the Mercedes Benz car – automobile – that I like on sale.  It was a d eal; instead of being 100,000 dollars it was only 80,000 dollars.  She laughed at  me, of course, that would be crazy.  But, it is a deal, and that’s what I told h er!

Well, Roxana wants to get the best deals, and she n eeds to go to the stores as soon as they open, because what happens here, as I guess in many places, when the stores are selling things cheap people wil l go to the store as early as possible, often waiting outside of the store until it opens.  Kurt says, “What?  I’m sleeping.  Leave me alone.”  Stop bothering me.  Ro xana – I guess she has an “a” at the end of her name – says, “You need to get  up now and come with me to the store for the after Christmas sales.”  The “aft er Christmas sales” are the sales that stores have after December 25 th , which is Christmas Day; they try to sell the things that people didn’t buy for Christmas.  She s ays, “You know that they slash prices and everything is on sale.”  “To slash” (sla sh) means to cut; “to slash prices” means to cut or lower prices.  From 100,000  to 80,000 they slashed the price.  What a deal!  “Everything,” Roxana says, “i s on sale.”  “To be on sale” means to be sold at a price that is lower than what  you normally sell it at.

Well, Kurt isn’t happy.  He says, “We just spent the past few weeks shopping for Christmas presents and now you want to shop some mo re?”  He’s incredulous; that is, he can’t believe that is what Roxana wants  to do.  But Roxana has an

answer.  She says, “We can stock up for next year.”   “To stock (stock) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to go to the store an d buy a lot of something for the future.  You don’t need it right now, but you’r e getting a lot of it in case there’s a problem in the future, or perhaps because the pri ce is good now; it’s on sale, you can buy it cheaply.  People sometimes go and st ock up on toilet paper and perhaps bottled water, or anything that they know t hat they can use in the future, and that you can keep for a long time – you can sto re it, you can put it in a closet and not worry about it.  Roxana wants to stock up f or next year – next Christmas. She says, “There’ll be deep discounts on all of the  Christmas decorations and supplies.”  A “discount” is when you lower the pric e.  A “deep discount” is when you lower the price a lot; it’s the same as “slashi ng prices,” you go from a dollar to 25 cents, that’s a “deep discount,” a big discou nt.

The discounts will be on Christmas decorations.  “D ecorations” are things that you use, you put up in a room to remind someone of the holiday.  Christmas decorations would include in the United States a Ch ristmas tree perhaps, though that usually isn’t something that would go on sale after Christmas – well, I guess it would, but it won’t keep until next year, unless  you buy an artificial tree, a tree that isn’t real.  We had one of those when I was gr owing up; never had a real Christmas tree, actually.  Anyway, “decorations” are things that people put up, maybe little Santa Clauses or other things associat ed with the Christmas holiday that people put in their homes and outside of their  homes.  Here in the United States, a lot of people put lights on the outside of their house during Christmas. My neighbor just put lights on his house.  I have n ever done that; I’m a little too lazy to do that, I think.  Anyway, these are exampl es of Christmas decorations. She says, “not to mention all of the winter clothin g and seasonal toys.  Let’s go!” Something that is “seasonal” is related to a specif ic season or time of the year. We talk about the four seasons: winter, spring, sum mer, and fall.  But, “seasonal” can also refer to a time or a period of time relate d to some event; in this case, it would be the Christmas season, which in the United States begins in late November and ends in late December.  These are the toys that Roxana wants to buy – seasonal toys.  I’m not sure exactly what the y would be.

Kurt says, “You go.  What do you need me for?”  Rox ana says, “I need you to run interference while I go for the best bargains and t o hold all of the bags and packages while I shop.  What else?”  “To run interf erence” is to help another person by protecting him or her from other people, or perhaps from criticism by other people.  It’s a term that we sometimes use in  American football to talk about the people who are stopping the opposing team  from tackling or putting to the ground one of your players.  “To run interferen ce” here means, I think, that Kurt would go and prevent other people, perhaps, fr om getting to the things that Roxana wants to buy.  It’s something of a joke, I g uess.  She says she is going to

go for the best bargains.  A “bargain” (bargain), w e mentioned already, is a deal, when you have a good price on something – a low pri ce on something.  So again, Roxana says to Kurt, “I need you to run inte rference while I go for the best bargains and to hold all of the bags and packages w hile I shop.  What else?” This expression “What else?” is an informal one use d when you think that what you are explaining to someone is very obvious; it’s  as though you shouldn’t have even asked the question, it’s so obvious you should  know the answer already. Of course, Roxana wants Kurt to hold all of the bag s and packages while she goes and buys some more.

Kurt says, “When I agreed to ‘for better or for wor se,’ I didn’t anticipate this!”  The expression “for better or for worse” is often used at a wedding ceremony.  When two people are getting married they make promises t o each other; these are formally called “vows” (vows), and part of the trad itional vow in English that is said at a wedding is that you will stay with your h usband or wife “for richer or for poorer.”  The “for” is sort of poetic; it means eve n if you are rich or poor.  “For richer or for poorer, for better or for worse,” mea ning if things go well or if things go badly you’re still going to stay with that perso n, and at the end you say, “till death do us part,” meaning till both of us die or, well, one of us dies.  That doesn’t happen in a lot of marriages, but that’s wh at people promise, they just don’t keep their promises.  Kurt says, “I didn’t an ticipate this!”  “To anticipate” means to predict, to believe something will happen in a certain way in the future. Kurt is saying that when he got married to Roxana h e didn’t think that he would have to get up early for the after Christmas sales.   And, well, I guess he wasn’t thinking very clearly when he got married!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Roxana:  Get up!  We’re going to miss out on the be st deals if we don’t get to the stores when they open.

Kurt:  What?  I’m sleeping.  Leave me alone.

Roxana:  You need to get up now and come with me to  the store for the after Christmas sales.  You know that they slash prices a nd everything is on sale.

This episode is a dialogue between Arturo and Ling talking about “styles of music,” things people like in music.  Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Arturo:  What are you listening to?

Ling:  Some new music.  You want to hear it?

Arturo:  All right.  That’s pretty mellow, kinda bl uesy, isn’t it?  It’s got an interesting indie feel.

Ling:  Do you like it?

Arturo:  It’s all right.  I like more funky, dance music myself, but this is okay.  It’s not too depressing.

Ling:  That’s faint praise.

Arturo:  No, no, I do like it.  I guess I’m usually  in the mood for more up-tempo music, something with a driving beat.  I’m a hard-c ore MC-Quillan fan, if that’s any indication.

Ling:  Oh, I see, so you don’t really like acoustic  music much.

Arturo:  It’s just not my thing, you know?

Ling:  Yeah, that’s too bad.

Arturo:  Why?

Ling:  That was a track I recorded last week.

Arturo:  This is your music?  In that case, I love it.

Ling:  You’re just saying that.

Arturo:  No, really, it’s growing on me.  In fact, I want to hear more.  How about if I bring over some dinner on Saturday and you can pl ay me a few more tracks?

Ling:  You don’t mind?

Arturo:  Believe me, I’ll be all ears.

[end of dialogue]

Arturo begins by saying, “What are you listening to ?”  Ling says, “Some new music.  You want to hear it?”  Notice she doesn’t s ay, “Do you want to hear it?” She’s speaking very informally.  Sometimes people d rop or eliminate the “do” in this kind of expression: “You want to eat?”  “Do yo u want to eat?”  Ling says, “You want to hear it (you want to hear my music)?”  Arturo says, “All right (okay).” He’s listening to it and he says, “That’s pretty me llow, kinda bluesy, isn’t it?” “Mellow” (mellow) means calm, quiet, very, we might  say, “tranquil.”  Something that is very peaceful is mellow.  Arturo says that Ling’s music is mellow, but also it’s kind of bluesy (bluesy).  “Bluesy” is an adjec tive that comes from “blues” (blues), which is a type of music formally called “ the blues.”  It’s a little sad sometimes; it’s often about things that are sad.  W hen someone says, “I’m feeling blue,” or, “I’ve got the blues,” they mean they’re feeling sad, they’re depressed.  So, blues music is often about things t hat are sad or depressing.  It was a style of music created in the early 20 th  century by African Americans here in the United States.

Arturo says that Ling’s music’s got an interesting indie feel.  “Indie” (indie) is a short form of “independent.”  “Independent” here re fers to a small record company, a company that makes CDs or MP3s and sells  them.  Usually, the word “indie” refers to a kind of music that is done  by lesser-known artists, singers who aren’t necessarily very famous, singing music t hat isn’t as popular as the kind of music you might hear on the radio.  So, “in die,” in referring to music, is that kind of music, but you could also have indie f ilms – movies, movies made

not with millions and millions of dollars, but with  a lot less money, less famous actors, but often about things that are perhaps mor e interesting than the movies you see in the movie theater.  So that’s “indie.”

Ling says, “Do you like it?”  Arturo says, “It’s al l right (it’s okay).  I like more funky, dance music myself.”  “Funky” (funky) means cool, h ip, interesting, unusual.  It’s a very broad adjective that could be used for lots of different things.  It was more popular, I think, in the 70s and 80s than it is now , but I guess you’ll still hear people talk about something being “funky,” someone my age perhaps.  “Dance music” is music that you would hear in a discothequ e; it usually has a very strong base line – a strong beat: bump bump bump bump bump  bump – that sort of thing.  And, I guess that’s easier for people to da nce to.  I’m not sure, I don’t go to discotheques, what we actually more commonly now  would just call “clubs.” I’m not a dance club kind of person, but for some p eople that’s what they like to do.  Of course when I was younger, well, you couldn ’t get me off the dance floor! The “dance floor” is the place where you dance, mea ning I loved to dance so much I was always dancing – dancing, dancing, danci ng, bump bump bump.

Anyway, back to reality.  Arturo says, “It’s not to o depressing,” describing Ling’s music, meaning it’s not too sad.  Ling says, “That’ s faint praise.”  “Faint (faint) praise” is when someone says something to you that sounds like a compliment but it really isn’t.  You are saying that, well, it ’s okay, but you’re really kind of criticizing the person.  So, when Arturo says that Ling’s music is not too depressing he’s making it sound like it’s a complim ent, but it’s really a criticism. That’s why Ling says, “That’s faint praise.”

Arturo says, “No, no, I do like it.”  He really is complimenting her, he says.  I’m thinking Arturo may be interested romantically in L ing, so of course he doesn’t want to insult her.  He says, “I do like it.  I gue ss I’m usually in the mood for more up-tempo music, something with a driving beat.”  “T o be in the mood for (something)” means to want to do something at a cer tain moment.  You may ask your husband or wife or friend, “What are you in the mood for for lunch today?” And they could say, “I’m in the mood for Japanese f ood.”  “I’m in the mood for French food,” or Korean or Chinese or whatever kind  of food you feel like – that you want to eat right now.  Well, Arturo is usually  in the mood for up-tempo music.  The “tempo” of the music is, roughly speaki ng, how fast it goes.  “Up- tempo” would be music that moves very fast, at a fa st rhythm or beat.  Arturo says he likes music with a driving beat.  A “drivin g beat” is similar to what I was talking about when I talked about dance music; it’s  something that has a very strong, repeating, usually fast beat – bump bump bu mp bump – the sort of thing you would hear in dance music, what used to be call ed “techno music” (techno),

that had that kind of driving beat.  It was a kind of song that you would – or music that you would dance to.  Is it still called techno  music?  I…I don’t know.

Arturo says, “I’m a hard-core MC-Quillan fan, if th at’s any indication.”  If you are “hard-core” about something you are very enthusiast ic about it, you are fully committed or dedicated to it, you are a big fan of something.  “I’m a hard-core Bruce Springsteen fan.”  I love Bruce Springsteen, I could listen to his music all day, I go to his concerts, I own all of his CDs and  records and all that sort of thing.  That’s to be “hard-core.”  In this case, Ar turo says he’s a hard-core MC- Quillan fan.  The “MC” is the person in charge of s ome ceremony or some event, but here it’s the person in charge of the music.  S o, “MC-Quillan” would be someone whose name was Quillan, but who was a “rapp er,” somebody who did a lot of rap music, kind of like me back 20 years a go, they called me MC-Quillan. I won’t actually rap for you however, and you shoul d be thankful for that!  Arturo says, “I’m a hard-core MC-Quillan fan, if that’s an y indication.”  We use that phrase, “if that’s any indication,” to show that we ’ve just given an example of the description or the explanation that we gave previou sly.

Ling says, “Oh, I see, so you don’t really like aco ustic music much.”  “Acoustic” (acoustic) is music that doesn’t have any electric guitars or electronic instruments.  It’s just, say, a guitar or a violin,  but not an electric guitar – a regular guitar, if you will.  Arturo says, “It’s just not m y thing, you know?”  When someone says, “it’s not my thing,” or, “it’s not his thing, ” in this case they mean it’s not something that you really like or enjoy.  The music  of Andrea Bocelli is not my thing.  He’s a very good singer, I’m sure.  Don’t g et mad, don’t send me emails saying you love Andrea Bocelli, I’m sure he’s a won derful singer.  He’s, of course, a famous Italian singer – popular singer, a s well as a classical singer. He’s just not my thing, okay?

Ling says, “Yeah, that’s too bad.”  Arturo says, “W hy?”  “That was a track I recorded last week,” Ling says.  A “track” is a son g on an album or a CD.  Arturo says, “This is your music?  In that case, I love it .”  Remember I said Arturo is interested romantically in Ling, I think.  Ling say s, “You’re just saying that,” meaning you don’t really believe what you are sayin g, that’s not really the truth. Arturo says, “No, really, it’s growing on me.”  Whe n we say something “grows on you” we mean you are starting to like it; you didn’ t like it in the beginning, but the more that you have it or experience it you like it more and more.  The music is growing on Arturo, he says, “In fact, I want to hea r more.  How about if I bring over some dinner on Saturday and you can play me a few more tracks?”  Ling says, “You don’t mind?” meaning that’s okay, that y ou would come over and listen to more of my music.  Arturo says, “Believe me, I’m all ears.”  The expression “all ears” means very eager or wanting v ery much to hear something

or to listen to someone.  Someone is saying, “I hav e a problem.  Can I ask your advice?”  You could say, “I’m all ears,” meaning ye s, I will listen to you completely and closely and carefully.  “Ears” has a  number of different other expressions that can be used with it, and other mea nings.  Take a look at our Learning Guide for some of them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Arturo:  What are you listening to?

Ling:  Some new music.  You want to hear it?

Arturo:  All right.  That’s pretty mellow, kinda bl uesy, isn’t it?  It’s got an interesting indie feel.

Ling:  Do you like it?

Arturo:  It’s all right.  I like more funky, dance music myself, but this is okay.  It’s not too depressing.

Ling:  That’s faint praise.

Arturo:  No, no, I do like it.  I guess I’m usually  in the mood for more up-tempo music, something with a driving beat.  I’m a hard-c ore MC-Quillan fan, if that’s any indication.

Ling:  Oh, I see, so you don’t really like acoustic  music much.

# Working With Unreliable People

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 752: Working With Unreliable People.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 752.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website, you know what it is, eslpod.com.  Go t here, download the Learning Guide, enjoy life.

This episode is a dialogue between Paul and Jackie,  and it’s going to be talking about people at work who don’t do what they are sup posed to do.  Sound familiar?  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paul:  What time is it?

Jackie:  It’s 2:30.  The Cleveland office report sh ould have been emailed to us by the end of the workday yesterday.  What are we supp osed to do now?

Paul:  If we don’t get their report, we’ll have to hold up the production of the annual report and if that happens, somebody’s head is going to roll.  This really leaves us in a lurch.  Who’s responsible for the re port in Cleveland?

Jackie:  Noel Simmons.

Paul:  Oh, no.  I know Noel.  I used to work with h im in the Columbus office.  He was always dropping the ball on his responsibilitie s and I was always having to cover for him.

Jackie:  You must have had the patience of a saint!   If he’s such a flake, why is he still working for this company?

Paul:  Beats me, but I know we’re in for a long wai t if he’s in charge.  We have to do something.  Get on the phone and see if you can light a fire under him. Unless we keep on him, we’ll never see that report.

Jackie:  Okay, I’ll call the Cleveland office right  now.

Paul:  And Jackie?

Jackie:  Yes?

Paul:  If he gives you a line or some kind of excus e, let me talk to him.

Jackie:  What’ll you do?

Paul:  I’ll take him on a trip down memory lane.  W hen I used to work with him, I wasn’t always so patient – or polite.

[end of dialogue]

We’re in a business office in this dialogue.  Paul asks Jackie what time it is. Jackie says, “It’s 2:30,” 2:30 in the afternoon.  S he says, “The Cleveland office report should have been emailed to us by the end of  the workday yesterday.” Cleveland is a city in the State of Ohio, which is in the eastern central part of the United States.  Jackie says that office – the Cleve land office should have emailed them a report, “What are we supposed to do now?”  W hat can we do now?  What should we do now?

Paul says, “If we don’t get their report, we’ll hav e to hold up the production of the annual report.”  “To hold up” here means to delay, to make something happen later than you originally planned because there has  been some problem.  In this case, the problem is that the other office didn’t f inish their “report,” their set of papers they were supposed to prepare about somethin g, we don’t know what. “To hold up” here, then, means to delay the “produc tion,” or the making of the annual report.  “Hold up” has other meanings, very different meanings, in English.  You can find some of those in our Learning Guide.  An “annual report” is a report that a large company produces, especial ly what we would call a “public company,” a publicly traded company, a comp any that people can buy stock in – partial ownership in.  They’re required to produce an annual report that says what they did the past year: what business the y did, what new projects they have, and so forth.  “Annual” means every year.  Pa ul says, “if that happens, somebody’s head is going to roll.”  The expression “heads will roll” or “someone’s head is going to roll” (roll) means someone will be  punished for this; someone is going to get into trouble for this, perhaps even fi red from their job – lose their job. The expression comes from when you kill people by c utting off their heads.  And, of course, after you cut off the head it would fall  down on the ground and “roll,” turn around kind of like a ball – kind of like a so ccer ball, always reminds me a little bit of that.  Anyway, Paul says, “This reall y leaves us in a lurch.”  “To be left in a lurch” (lurch) means that you have a big probl em, a very difficult situation.

“He left me in a lurch,” he left me with a very dif ficult situation.  Paul says, “Who’s responsible for the report in Cleveland?”  Who is t he person who is supposed to be writing this report?  Jackie says, “Noel Simmons .”  Paul says, “Oh, no.  I know Noel (I know this person).  I used to work with him  in the Columbus office.” Columbus is another city in Ohio.  There are three cities in Ohio that begin with “C” – at least three: Columbus, Cleveland, and Cinc innati.

Well, Paul used to work with Noel in the Columbus o ffice.  He says Noel “was always dropping the ball on his responsibilities.”  The expression “to drop the ball” means not to do what you are supposed to do, to be unreliable.  The title of this episode is “Working With Unreliable People,” n ot reliable.  “Reliable” means you can trust them, you can trust them to do what t hey are supposed to do.  Well, Noel is unreliable; he’s always dropping the ball.  Paul says, “I was always having to cover for him.”  “To cover for (someone)”  means to do something so that other people don’t know that this person has m ade a mistake.  You are, perhaps, lying or doing something so that no one el se discovers what your friend or your coworker did wrong.  You’re helping them th at way – at least you think you are.

Jackie says, “You must have had the patience of a s aint!”  “To be patient” means to be able to wait, to tolerate or put up with diff icult situations without getting angry or without losing your temper.  A “saint” is a holy person; someone, here, who represents a perfect person; someone who is ver y holy, someone who is very, very good.  Jackie says, “You must have had t he patience of a saint!”  It’s an expression.  She says, “If he’s such a flake, wh y is he still working for this company?”  A “flake” (flake) is an unreliable perso n, someone who doesn’t do what they’re supposed to do.  The State of Californ ia, the City of Los Angeles especially, is full of flakes, people who say they’ re going to do something but don’t.  At least, that’s the reputation that the ci ty and state have with some people.  Jackie wants to know why Noel, if he’s suc h a flake, is still working at the company.  Why didn’t he get fired?

Paul says, “Beats me.”  “Beats me” is an informal w ay of saying I don’t know, I don’t know the answer to that question.  He says, “ Beats me, but I know we’re in for a long wait if he’s in charge.”  “To be in for”  means to be expecting or deserving to have something done.  “We’re in for a cold winter this year,” meaning we can expect a cold winter.  In this case,  Paul says they’re in for a long wait if he, Noel, is in charge.  “To be in charge” means to be responsible for some project or some group; you’re the person who i s the boss of that project: you make the decisions, and so forth.  Paul says, “ We have to do something. Get on the phone (call on the telephone) and see if  you can light a fire under him.”  The expression “to light a fire under (someo ne)” means to do or say

something to get that person to work, to do somethi ng, especially if the person is lazy or unreliable.  Usually it means applying some  sort of pressure, doing something to push the person to get their job done.   If you light a fire you will create heat, of course, and that will cause a perso n to get up and move if you actually lit a fire under someone.  Well, that’s wh at you’re trying to do here.  Paul says, “Unless we keep on him (keep on Noel), we’ll never see that report.”  “To keep on (someone)” means to bother them repeatedly until they do what you want them to do.  Another word for this would be “t o nag” (nag).  “Stop nagging me.”  This is something husbands occasionally – not  this husband – says about their wives.  “My wife is always nagging me to do s omething,” always telling me to do something until I actually do it.  Well, that ’s what Paul says they have to do with Noel.

Jackie says, “Okay, I’ll call the Cleveland office right now.”  Paul says, “And Jackie?”  Jackie says, “Yes?”  Actually, probably s ays something like “Yes?” Paul says, “If he gives you a line or some kind of excuse, let me talk to him.” When you say you’re “giving someone a line” (line) you mean you’re giving them an excuse, something that other people might say as  an excuse.  “Oh, I got busy,” or “Oh, my cat died and I had to go home and  bury it,” put it in the ground, give it a funeral, and so forth.  These are excuses , and many people try to give excuses when they don’t do what they’re supposed to  do.  So Paul says, “If he gives you a line (an excuse), let me talk to him.”

Jackie says, “What’ll you do?”  What will you do?  Paul says, “I’ll take him on a trip down memory lane.”  A “lane” (lane) is like a small road.  But the expression “to take a trip down memory lane” means to spend so me time remembering things that have happened in the past.  Normally, t he expression means you’re taking a pleasant trip, if you will, you’re remembe ring good things that happened in the past.  But in this case, Paul is making some thing of a joke.  He’s going to remind Noel of bad things that happened in the past .  He says, “When I used to work with him, I wasn’t always so patient – or poli te.”  “To be polite” (polite) means to be kind, to be nice.  It’s the opposite of  “rude” (rude), which means to be mean, not to be nice.  Paul is saying that he’s going to treat Noel the way he used to treat him in the past.  That is, he’s proba bly going to get angry with him.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paul:  What time is it?

Jackie:  It’s 2:30.  The Cleveland office report sh ould have been emailed to us by the end of the workday yesterday.  What are we supp osed to do now?

Paul:  If we don’t get their report, we’ll have to hold up the production of the annual report and if that happens, somebody’s head is going to roll.  This really leaves us in a lurch.  Who’s responsible for the re port in Cleveland?

# Enduring Hazing

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 753: Enduring Hazing.

This episode is a conversation between Rafael and H annah about something called “hazing,” which is what happens you join an organization and are made to do certain things that may be humiliating or possib ly even dangerous.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rafael:  Go away and stop following us.  Our club i s for boys only.

Hannah:  But I want to join.

Rafael:  You do, huh?  Did you know that to join ou r club, you have to go through an initiation?

Hannah:  Okay, I’ll do that.  What do I have to do?

Rafael:  You have to endure weeks of hazing.  We’ll  be putting you through your paces to make sure you’re club material.

Hannah:  I’m willing to do that.  I can do anything  you boys can do.  Watch me!

Rafael:  I’m not so sure.  If you want to be one of  the guys, you’ll have to do everything we tell you to do, even if you don’t wan t to.

Hannah:  Everything?

Rafael:  Yeah, everything.  If we tell you to eat d irt, you have to eat dirt.  If we tell you to stand outside in the rain, you have to do th at, too.  Get the picture?

Hannah:  Yeah, I’ve got the picture.

Rafael:  If we tell you to pull a prank, you have to do it.  If we tell you to streak, you have to do that, too.

Hannah:  You can’t be serious.  That really crosses  the line.

Rafael:  We decide what crosses the line and what d oesn’t.  See?  I knew you’d be too chicken to join our club.

Hannah:  You’re right.  I don’t want to join any cl ub where the members are stupid enough to do all of those things.  I’m start ing my own club – one where you don’t have to humiliate yourself to get in.

Rafael:  Suit yourself.  I knew you weren’t club ma terial.

Hannah:  Thank goodness for that!

[end of dialogue]

Rafael begins our dialogue by saying to Hannah, “Go  away and stop following us (stop walking behind us or going where we’re going) .  Our club is for boys only.” So, Rafael and Hannah are children.  A “club” is an  organization, an association, a group of people interested in some topic.  We cal l the people in the group “members” of that club.  Sometimes the clubs are fo rmal, but sometimes we use the word informally.  We may have a “book club,” a group people who all read the same book and then come together and talk about it.   This is a club of the kind that young boys might have, and Rafael says that it ’s for boys only.

Hannah says, “I want to join.”  I want to become a member.  Rafael says, “You do, huh (meaning oh, really)?  Did you know that to  join our club, you have to go through an initiation?”  An “initiation” (initiatio n) is some sort of series of actions, a “ceremony” or “ritual” we might call it, to bring  new members into a group.  It could just be the head of the group saying, “Welcom e, you are now members,” it could involve something else.  The new members may have to do something as part of their initiation.  “To initiate” also means , as a verb, to begin, so you can see the connection with the noun “initiation,” it’s  something that happens at the beginning of your membership in the club.

Hannah says, “Okay, I’ll do that.  What do I have to do?”  Rafael says, “You have to endure weeks of hazing.”  “To endure” (endure) m eans to experience something difficult, unpleasant, something that mig ht be uncomfortable, even

painful for a long period of time.  “He endured a l ot of pain after he broke his leg.” He had to suffer through a lot of pain, to tolerate  a lot of pain.  Well, Rafael says that Hannah would have to endure weeks of hazing.  “Hazing” (hazing) is the process where some clubs or organizations make new members do silly, sometimes stupid, or even dangerous things in order  to become a member of the club.  This is most common at colleges and universi ties that have all-male or all- female organizations, what are called “fraternities ” and “sororities,” at least the ones that participate in this kind of hazing.  The colleges say they can’t do it; many students have actually died during these silly , rather stupid initiation rituals or initiation actions, but it continues to happen.  It seems like every year we read about some hazing incident or situation at a colleg e or university.

Rafael says, “We’ll be putting you through your pac es to make sure you’re club material.”  “To put (someone) through their paces” (paces) means to test someone thoroughly and completely to make sure that  this person can do everything you want them to do.  Well, Rafael is go ing to try to put Hannah through her paces, to make her do all sorts things.   “To make sure,” he says, “that you are club material.”  “Material” here mean s good enough to meet the requirements of some job or position.  Sometimes wo men might say, “He’s not really very good boyfriend material” or “husband ma terial,” meaning he wouldn’t make a good boyfriend or a good husband.  That’s the idea of “material” here. “Material” can also be the substance, what somethin g is made out of, especially clothing.  But here it means whether this person is  good enough for this position.

Hannah says, “I’m willing to do that.  I can do any thing you boys can do.  Watch me!”  “Watch me” is a phrase we use to tell someone  to observe what I do because I’m going to do something unexpected or som ething you don’t think I can do.  For example, there are two men in a park a nd they see a beautiful woman, and one man says to the other, “You are too chicken to go over and talk to that beautiful woman.”  To say you’re “chicken” means you’re afraid, you’re scared, you’ll never go and it do.  And the other m an says, “Oh, you think I’m too scared?  I’m going to go get her telephone number s o I can call her and ask her out on a date.  Watch me!” meaning I’m going to do something you don’t think I can do.

Rafael says, “I’m not so sure (I’m not so sure you,  Hannah, can do anything we boys can do).  If you want to be one of the guys, y ou’ll have to do everything we tell you to do, even if you don’t want to.”  “To be  one of the guys” is an expression meaning to be one of the group, especial ly a group of boys or young men.  It’s usually used to describe a girl or a wom an who is friends with a group of men, but not friendly in a romantic way, just fr iendly just like she were another

man.  She may play sports with them or go drinking with them or whatever; that would be “one of the guys.”  That’s what Hannah wan ts to be.

Hannah says, “Everything?”  I have to do everything  you tell me to do?  Rafael says, “Yeah (meaning yes), everything.  If we tell you to eat dirt (eat the black part of the earth, in essence), you have to eat dir t.  If we tell you to stand outside in the rain, you have to do that, too.  Get the pic ture?”  The expression “get the picture,” as a question, is to understand completel y what someone is talking about or what someone is asking.  You might also sa y, “Oh, I get the picture,” meaning yes, I understand everything you are talkin g about.  Sometimes we use that expression when you don’t actually give the ot her person all of the specific details – the specific information, but they are ab le to understand what you are really trying to say.

Hannah says, “Yeah, I’ve got the picture.”  “Got” i s the past tense, of course, of “get.”  Rafael says, “If we tell you to pull a pran k, you have to do it.”  “To pull a prank” (prank) means to do something that tricks an other person into doing something that makes them look silly or foolish.  I t’s like a joke; we might call it a “practical joke,” a joke that involves some physica l action.  He says, “If we tell you to streak, you have to do that, too.”  “To stre ak” (streak) means to take off all of your clothes and run quickly in public, in a par k or in a store, past everyone else without any clothes on – “naked,” we would say .  This was a strange thing that became popular in the 1970s, when I was growin g up.  I’m not sure, it might have been something people were smoking!  “Streak” has a number of different meanings however, not related to being naked.  You can find those in our Learning Guide.

Hannah says to Rafael, “You can’t be serious.  That  really crosses the line.”  “To cross the line” means to go too far, to do somethin g that is too extreme, that is unacceptable.  Rafael says, “We decide what crosses  the line and what doesn’t. I knew you’d be too chicken (too scared) to join the club.”  Hannah says, “You’re right.  I don’t want to join any club where the mem bers are stupid enough (are dumb enough) to do all of those things,” all of tho se things involved in the initiation – the hazing.  “I’m starting my own club ,” she says, “one where you don’t have to humiliate yourself to get in.”  “To h umiliate yourself” means to embarrass yourself.  “To humiliate” (humiliate) is to do something silly or stupid that makes other people laugh at you or think somet hing bad about you.  “To get yourself in” or “to get in” means to be accepted by  a group or an organization. Hannah says she is going to have a club where you d on’t have to humiliate yourself to get into the club.

Rafael says, “Suit yourself.”  “To suit (suit) your self” means to do whatever makes you happy.  The expression is usually used wh en someone doesn’t agree with the actions of another person.  The other pers on may refuse to do what the first person wants them to do or they may simply de cide to do something different, you say, “Well, suit yourself.”  It’s cr iticism; it’s saying you’re not doing what I want you to do but I don’t care, go ahead, d o it.  Rafael says, “I knew you weren’t club material.”  Hannah says, “Thank goodne ss for that!”  “Thank goodness” is a phrase we use to show gratitude or r elief, to say, “Oh, that’s a good thing.  Thank goodness.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rafael:  Go away and stop following us.  Our club i s for boys only.

Hannah:  But I want to join.

Rafael:  You do, huh?  Did you know that to join ou r club, you have to go through an initiation?

Hannah:  Okay, I’ll do that.  What do I have to do?

Rafael:  You have to endure weeks of hazing.  We’ll  be putting you through your paces to make sure you’re club material.

Hannah:  I’m willing to do that.  I can do anything  you boys can do.  Watch me!

Rafael:  I’m not so sure.  If you want to be one of  the guys, you’ll have to do everything we tell you to do, even if you don’t wan t to.

Hannah:  Everything?

Rafael:  Yeah, everything.  If we tell you to eat d irt, you have to eat dirt.  If we tell you to stand outside in the rain, you have to do th at, too.  Get the picture?

Hannah:  Yeah, I’ve got the picture.

Rafael:  If we tell you to pull a prank, you have to do it.  If we tell you to streak, you have to do that, too.

Hannah:  You can’t be serious.  That really crosses  the line.

 Rafael:  We decide what crosses the line and what d oesn’t.  See?  I knew you’d be too chicken to join our club.

Hannah:  You’re right.  I don’t want to join any cl ub where the members are stupid enough to do all of those things.  I’m start ing my own club – one where you don’t have to humiliate yourself to get in.

Rafael:  Suit yourself.  I knew you weren’t club ma terial.

Hannah:  Thank goodness for that!

# Being in a Flood

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 754: Being in a Flood.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 754.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there, download the Learning Guide, and improve your English faster than ever.

This episode is called “Being in a Flood.”  A “floo d” is when there is too much water; the river has too much water and it goes bey ond the river.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cherise:  Well, that was a rude awakening at 2:00 i n the morning!

Don:  At least we got out of our room before it flo oded.  It serves us right for planning a vacation here during the rainy season.  Our luggage is probably soaked.

Cherise:  Oh, no, I’d forgotten about our clothes.  If the water doesn’t recede soon, everything will have mold and mildew on it.

Don:  The sump pumps are working as we speak.  Hope fully, we can retrieve our stuff soon.

Cherise:  Maybe I should go downstairs and try to s alvage what I can, before things get washed away.

Don:  What?!  You could drown in all that water.  F orget it!

Cherise:  Drown in three feet of water?  Don’t be s illy.

Don:  I’ve seen you swim.  Come on, let’s just wait  until we get the go-ahead.

Cherise:  I still think I should try.

Don:  I have one word for you: snakes.

 Cherise:  Enough said!

[end of dialogue]

Cherise begins by saying, “Well, that was a rude aw akening at 2:00 in the morning!”  “To be awakened” means to be woken up, s o an “awakening” is when you are sleeping and then you wake up.  A “rude awa kening” would be an awakening that was very sudden, because of a loud n oise perhaps.  Cherise says that she received a rude awakening at 2:00 in the morning – two a.m.

Don says, “At least we got out of our room before it flooded.”  “To flood” (flood), as a verb, is when a building or an area is suddenl y covered with water when it isn’t supposed to be.  So if a river, for example, has too much water, it may flood the areas around the river.  “To be flooded” is to be in the condition of having too much water.  Don says, “It serves us right for plan ning a vacation here during the rainy season.”  The expression “to serve (someone) right” means to get what you deserve, because of your own actions you should hav e expected something bad to happen.  So, someone is talking on a cell phone while driving a car and suddenly they aren’t paying attention and they hit another car, we might say, “Well, that serves them right.”  They should have k nown, but because of their own actions something bad happened to them – not to  mention the other car!

Well, Don and Cherise planned a vacation somewhere during the “rainy season,” the time of year when it rains a lot, which of cour se will be different in different places.  Los Angeles has something of a rainy seaso n in the winter and early spring, not very much however.  Don says that our “ luggage” – our baggage, the things we use to put our clothes in – he says, “Our  luggage is probably soaked.” “To be soaked” (soaked) is to be very wet.  We migh t also use the term “drenched” (drenched); it’s completely full of wate r.  If you walk out into the rain, and you have your clothing on, you will probably ge t soaked; your clothes will all be very wet.  That’s what Don is talking about; he says, “Our luggage is probably soaked.”

Cherise says, “Oh, no, I’d forgotten about our clot hes (our clothing).  If the water doesn’t recede soon, everything will have mold and mildew on it.”  “To recede” (recede) means for something to go back, to move ba ckwards.  If the water receded, the water will go back to where it belongs .  So if a river floods, and then the water recedes, the water goes away from the pla ces where it shouldn’t have been back into the river.  You can talk about someo ne’s hairline receding, especially a man.  Your “hairline” is where you sti ll have hair on your head; the line, if you will, that separates the hair from the  skin, the part of your head that

doesn’t have hair.  If you have a receding hairline  that means you’re losing your hair; you have less and less of it every year.  Tho ugh, they say men with receding hairlines are more intelligent than other men – I’m not really sure!

Cherise is worried that the clothes will have mold and mildew on them.  “Mold” (mold) are actually very small plants that grow on objects that are a little bit wet – we would say “damp” (damp) – often food or some obj ects.  They are green and black typically in color; sometimes mold will have a certain unpleasant smell. Mold, especially on things in your house, is almost  always a bad thing.  “Mildew” (mildew) are also very small plants, like mold.  Us ually they’re either white or green; they’re very similar to mold.  Normally we a ssociate mildew with clothing. So, if clothing gets wet and then it stays that way  for a long time – it’s in a closet or some other place that’s damp, that’s slightly we t – it may become mildewed and you can’t really wear it anymore, it has a cert ain smell to it that you don’t want to have on your body.

Don says that the sump pumps are working as we spea k.  A “sump (sump) pump (pump)” is a special machine that is used to remove  water, for example, from the bottom of a building or a house, from the “basement ,” the floor below the ground. If you get a lot of water in your house you may nee d one of these sump pumps to get rid of the water.  Don says, “The sump pumps are working as we speak.” The expression “as we speak” means right now, at th is very moment.  Don says, “Hopefully (we hope), we can retrieve our stuff soo n.”  “To retrieve” (retrieve) means to go somewhere and get something and bring it back.  “I left my wallet on my desk at work.  I need to go back and retrieve it .”  To get it back, to bring it back to where I am now.

Cherise says, “Maybe I should go downstairs and try  to salvage what I can, before things get washed away.”  “To salvage” (salv age) means to save what can be saved from a group of things that otherwise are being destroyed or will be destroyed soon because of rain, or floods, or whate ver.  I’m going to try to salvage, I’m going to try to take what I can save a nd get rid of the rest.  Cherise wants to salvage their luggage “before things get w ashed away.”  “Washed away” would mean taken away by the water, the water  that is part of the flood in this case.

Don says, “What?!  You could drown in all of that w ater.”  “To drown” (drown) means to die while you are underwater.  The water f ills up your lungs, you cannot breathe, and so you die.  That is “to drown.”  Don says, “Forget it!”  Cherise says, “Drown in three feet of water?  Don’t be silly.”  S he’s saying that the water is only three feet high and therefore she won’t drown, so s he’s telling Don that he is wrong.  She says, “Don’t be silly.”  Don says, “I’v e seen you swim.  Come on,

let’s just wait until we get the go-ahead.”  The “g o-ahead” is a way of saying approval, when someone in authority says, “yes, you  can do that.”  Don is waiting for the authorities to say it’s okay for them to go  back downstairs and look at their stuff – try to salvage their stuff.

But Cherise wants to go; she says, “I still think I  should try.”  Don says, “I have one word for you: snakes.”  A “snake” (snake) is a long animal that doesn’t have any legs; it moves around on the ground.  It can so metimes bite you, and it has, sometimes, poison that can kill you.  Don uses an e xpression we sometimes use in English for emphasis; to get someone’s attention  we say, “I have one word for you,” and that one word will explain everything.  I n this case, the word is “snakes.”  Obviously Cherise is scared or frightene d of snakes.  She responds by saying, “Enough said!”  The phrase “enough said” sh ows that you have heard what the person has said, and you agree or understa nd it completely so the other person doesn’t have to say any more.  I get it; I u nderstand, there are snakes downstairs.  Why?  I…I’m not really sure, but there  are snakes downstairs and I don’t like snakes, therefore I am not going downsta irs.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cherise:  Well, that was a rude awakening at 2:00 i n the morning!

Don:  At least we got out of our room before it flo oded.  It serves us right for planning a vacation here during the rainy season.  Our luggage is probably soaked.

Cherise:  Oh, no, I’d forgotten about our clothes.  If the water doesn’t recede soon, everything will have mold and mildew on it.

This episode is a dialogue between Darlene and Chri s about someone who doesn’t like new technology.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Darlene:  Thanks for agreeing to take a look at my computer.  It’s been acting up lately.

Chris:  Sure, I don’t mind.  Is this it?

Darlene:  Yeah.

Chris:  How long have you had this computer?  It lo oks like it belongs in the ice age.

Darlene:  I admit it’s a little dated.  I must be o ne of the last holdouts in switching to a newer model.

Chris:  What are you waiting for?  It seems to me t hat all of your computer problems would be solved if you spring for a new on e.

Darlene:  I have a lot of old programs on this comp uter that aren’t compatible with the newer models.  I’m kind of attached to the m.

Chris:  They probably aren’t compatible because the re are now better, more efficient programs that have overtaken the ones you  currently use.  Your programs are probably obsolete.  Which programs are  they?  Maybe I can show you how to use the newer versions.

 Darlene:  Well, there’s one particular program…

Chris:  Yes?

Darlene:  It’s a game I like to play.

Chris:  You’re refusing to buy a newer, better comp uter just because you’d have to give up a game?

Darlene:  It’s a really fun game and I’m keeping th is computer until they make a version for the newer computers.

Chris:  Okay, but you know what they say: live by t he sword, die by the sword.

Darlene:  So you won’t help me fix my computer?

Chris:  I’ll try, but I’m telling you now.  It’s a lost cause.

[end of dialogue]

Darlene says to Chris, “Thanks for agreeing to take  a look at my computer.  It’s been acting up lately.”  The verb “to act up” is a two-word phrasal expression meaning to behave or operate badly in a way that yo u don’t expect or that isn’t doing what you want it to do.  If your computer is running slowly, or certain programs aren’t working the way they should, we mig ht say that your computer is acting up.  There are several other meanings of thi s expression; look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Chris says, “Sure, I don’t mind.  Is this it?”  Is this your computer?  Darlene says, “Yeah.”  Chris says, “How long have you had this co mputer?  It looks like it belongs in the ice age.”  The “ice age” is a very c old period of history, approximately 20,000 years ago, when much of the Ea rth was covered with ice and snow.  However in this conversation, it’s used to describe something that is very, very, very old.  We might also say the “stone  age,” meaning a long, long time ago.

Chris wants to know how long Darlene has had this c omputer.  Darlene says, “I admit it’s a little dated.”  Something that is “dat ed” here means out of date, not modern, very old, something that is not what you wo uld find nowadays.  Darlene says, “I must be one of the last holdouts in switch ing to a newer model.”  A “holdout” (holdout – one word) is someone who is the last person to change,

someone who doesn’t want to agree to something or d oesn’t want to accept something.  A “holdout” would be someone or some or ganization that resists changing; everyone else is changing but they will n ot.  Darlene says that she must be one of the last holdouts in switching to a newer model.  “To switch” means to replace or exchange one thing for another,  to buy something new in this case.  A “model” (model) here means one partic ular design of a machine. With computers, there’s usually a new model of your  computer – your kind of computer – every year.  If you own an Apple compute r the Apple computer you buy in 2012 will not be the same, often, as the one  you bought in 2011 or 2010; there are newer models – newer types.

Chris says, “What are you waiting for?  It seems to  me that all of your computer problems would be solved (you wouldn’t have them an ymore) if you spring for a new one (a new computer).”  “To spring for (somethi ng)” means to pay for something; it’s an informal way of saying to buy or  to pay for – “to spring for (something).”  “Spring” has a couple of other meani ngs in English as well; once again, look at the Learning Guide for some addition al explanations.

Chris wants Darlene to buy a new computer.  Darlene  says, “I have a lot of old programs on this computer that aren’t compatible wi th the newer models.”  “To be compatible” (compatible) means that you can use it with something else, often referring to hardware and software, when we say thi s software is compatible with the new software, even though it’s a new operating system.  For example you go from Windows XP to Windows 7, you want to know if y our software – your programs – will be compatible.  Will they work?  Mo re generally, the adjective “compatible” refers to two things or two people who  will get along well together. Some people end a relationship because they decide they are not compatible with the other person, or because the other person forgot her birthday and now she’s upset and if he had only called her she would n’t be angry.  See?

Well, Darlene is worried about the compatibility of  her computer software.  She says that she is very attached to her computer prog rams.  “To be attached to” here means to like something very much; you don’t want to get rid of it.  “I’m very attached to my old television.”  I like it very muc h.  You can attach something to something else.  You can attach, for example, a fil e to an email, but here the verb means to like something: “I’m very attached to (som ething).”  So Darlene doesn’t want to buy a new computer because she’s very attac hed to some programs that won’t be compatible with the new computer and its n ew operating system, which is the software – the general software, we could ca ll it, that the computer uses.

Chris says, “They probably aren’t compatible becaus e they’re now better, more efficient programs that have overtaken the ones you  currently use.”  “To

overtake” (overtake) means to go past something, to  become better or more successful than someone or something else.  “The te am began winning more games and they overtook” – notice the past tense – “overtook the opposing team (the other team that they were playing).”  Well, Ch ris is saying that the computer programs that Darlene has are probably better now, they have new versions that are better so she doesn’t really need to worry abou t compatibility, she just needs to get the new programs – the new software programs .  Chris says, “Your programs are probably obsolete.”  “To be obsolete” (obsolete) means they are no longer useful because there is something else that can do the same thing better now.  Some people say that cassette tapes are obsol ete because we have things that are better now, like CDs and DVDs and MP3s.  A lthough, one thing I liked about the old cassette tapes is that when you stopp ed listening to a song the tape would stay right there and you could go back t o start right where you were before.  With a CD, of course, you can’t actually d o that, at least you can fast forward or rewind, but you understand what I’m sayi ng.  So maybe cassette tapes aren’t obsolete after all.  I still have a wh ole box of them in my closet.

Well, Chris thinks that Darlene’s software programs  are obsolete.  He says, “Which programs are they?  Maybe I can show you how  to use the newer versions (the newer kinds of that software).”  Darl ene says, “Well, there’s one particular program…”  Chris says, “Yes?”  Darlene s ays, “It’s a game I like to play.”  Chris says, “You’re refusing to buy a newer , better computer just because you have to give up a game?”  “To give up (somethin g)” or “to give (something) up” means to decide you no longer can use it or you  can no longer do that.  “I’m going to give up smoking.”  I’m going to stop smoki ng.  I don’t actually smoke, so that’s just an example.  “I’m going to give up talk ing about cats.”  I talk about cats all the time, you know I love cats, but maybe I’ll give up talking about them – probably not, though.

Chris is saying that Darlene doesn’t want to buy a new computer because she doesn’t want to give up a game that she plays on he r old computer.  Darlene says, “It’s a really fun game and I’m keeping this computer until they make a version for the newer computers.”  Chris says, “Oka y, but you know what they say: live by the sword, die by the sword.”  A “swor d” is a long, sharp instrument; it’s a weapon that you hurt or kill someone with.  It’s like a big knife, you could call it.  There’s an expression “live by the sword,  die by the sword,” which originally, I believe, appeared in the Bible.  It m eans that the way you choose to live affects what happens to you in the future.  Us ually you’re telling someone that if you are going to act that way eventually yo u are going to be hurt by your actions.  If you always criticize other people, and  then some day someone criticizes you and you’re hurt by that, we could sa y, “Well, live by the sword, die

by the sword.”  You did that sort of thing and now you are suffering from that same action.

Darlene says, “So you won’t help me fix my computer ?”  Chris says, “I’ll try, but I’m telling you now.  It’s a lost cause.”  A “lost cause” (cause) is something that cannot succeed no matter how hard you try; you can try doing it but you will not be successful.  You will lose, if you will, and hen ce, or therefore, it’s a lost cause.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Darlene:  Thanks for agreeing to take a look at my computer.  It’s been acting up lately.

Chris:  Sure, I don’t mind.  Is this it?

Darlene:  Yeah.

Chris:  How long have you had this computer?  It lo oks like it belongs in the ice age.

This episode is a dialogue between Maya and Diego a bout having business meetings.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Diego:  Okay, why don’t you brief me on what you’ve  planned for the meeting tomorrow?

Maya:  Sure.  At the meeting of the managers tomorr ow, we’ll begin with introductions.  Since you’re the most senior manage r, the job falls to you.

Diego:  I don’t think we need to stand on ceremony.   Have Alexi do the introductions.

Maya:  All right.  Then, we’ll follow the agenda an d discuss each item of business.  I have you down to lead the discussions.

Diego:  I don’t think we need the meeting to be so structured.  If we follow the agenda point-by-point, we’ll never find out what’s really on the minds of the managers, what issues they think are of paramount i mportance.  I think I’ll open the floor to anyone who wants to raise an issue.

Maya:  Wouldn’t that turn into a free for all?  I’m  not sure we’ll get much accomplished.

Diego:  Sometimes, it’s not as important to accompl ish something as it is to take the pulse of the group.  If we want to know what is sues are on the managers’ minds, we first need to let the managers speak free ly.  Agreed?

 Maya:  Uh, sure.  You’re the boss.  Should I also c ancel the lunch I’ve ordered so you can make up your minds about food later?

Diego:  Absolutely not!  The one thing that’s not o pen for discussion is what I’m eating for lunch.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Diego saying, “Okay, why d on’t you brief me on what you’ve planned for the meeting tomorrow?”  “To brie f” (brief) someone on something means to give them very quickly the most important information.  We usually, when there isn’t a lot of time, we use thi s expression.  Tell me just the most important things I need to know.  Of course, t he word “brief” as an adjective means to be short.  Here, we use it as a verb meani ng to give me information quickly.

Maya says, “Sure.  At the meeting of the managers t omorrow, we’ll begin with introductions,” meaning we’ll find out the name and  the job of everyone there at the meeting.  Maya says, “Since you (Diego) are the  most senior manager, the job falls to you.”  “Senior” means the one with the  most experienced here.  It can also mean older, but here in a company setting, the  senior executives are those who have the most experience.  Those are often the ones who are the oldest, as well.  “The job falls to you,” Maya says.  “To fall  to (someone)” means to be your responsibility because of the way the rules or expe ctations are in this organization.  “This job falls to you,” it’s your j ob, your responsibility; you have to do it.

Diego says, “I don’t think we need to stand on cere mony.”  The expression “to stand on ceremony” means to be very formal, to not be casual, to follow all of the rules.  But even though Diego is the senior manager , he doesn’t want to follow the tradition of him doing the work; he suggests Al exi do the introductions.

Maya says, “All right.  Then, we’ll follow the agen da and discuss each item of business.”  An “agenda” (agenda) is a written plan about what you are going to talk about in a meeting: first you’re going to talk  about this, then you’re going to talk about that.  Usually, if it’s a business meeti ng, you have a piece of paper that tells you, in order, the things that you’re going t o talk about at that meeting, especially if it’s a very formal meeting.  Maya say s they’re going to discuss each item of business.  At a meeting, an “item of busine ss” is any topic or subject that’s going to be discussed.  It doesn’t have to b e actually related to business. You could have a formal meeting for an organization  at your church or an

organization in your community, and if you have a m eeting of the leaders – of the directors – you might have different things on the agenda, each one of those would be an “item of business,” even though we’re n ot talking about a business like making money.  Maya says, “I have you down to lead the discussions.”  “I have you down” means I have written down – I have p ut down your name on a piece of paper, or I have your commitment, or I kno w that you are going to do this thing.

But Diego says, “I don’t think we need the meeting to be so structured.”  The title of this episode is “Having (or holding) Structured and Unstructured Meetings.” “Structured” would be something that is planned ver y carefully: first you do this, then you do that.  You follow the rules of a formal  meeting very carefully, and everything is planned.  Diego says, “If we follow t he agenda point-by-point, we’ll never find out what’s really on the minds of the ma nagers.”  “Point-by (by) -point” means one thing at a time, one item of business at a time.  Diego says that if we hold the meeting – if we conduct the meeting this w ay we won’t really find out what the managers at the meaning are thinking, what  is “on their minds,” which means what are they thinking.  Diego want to find o ut what the managers think is of paramount importance.  “Paramount” (paramount) m eans extremely important, more important than anything else.  If someone says , “this is of paramount importance,” they mean it is very important, highly  important.  Diego says, “I think I’ll open the floor to anyone who wants to raise an  issue.”  “To open the floor” is when the leader of a meeting says anyone can now speak about whatever topic they want to talk about.  That would be a very “uns tructured” meeting, a meeting that wasn’t planned carefully.  Diego says he’ll op en the floor to anyone who wants to raise an issue.  “To raise an issue” means  to mention a concern or a worry that hasn’t yet been discussed, or to ask a q uestion that hasn’t been discussed.

Maya said, “Wouldn’t that turn (the meeting) into a  free for all?”  The expression “free for (for) all (all)” means to have a situatio n where everyone is talking at the same time.  It’s very disorganized, not just unstru ctured, but lacking any sort of organization, being not very productive because eve ryone’s talking at the same time.  Maya says, “I’m not sure we’ll get much acco mplished (we’ll get a lot of things done).”

Diego says, “Sometimes, it’s not as important to ac complish something as it is to take the pulse of the group.”  The expression “to t ake the pulse” (pulse) means to understand the way people are thinking or to unders tand the current situation, especially as it relates to people’s feelings and o pinions.  Literally, in your body your pulse is the blood that is going through your body.  You can measure your pulse in a couple of different places: inside of yo ur wrist, at the end of your arm,

is one place.  But as an expression, “to take the p ulse” of a group of people means to get a good idea about what they are feelin g and thinking.  Diego says, “If we want to know what issues are on the managers ’ minds, we first need to let the managers speak freely.”  “To speak freely” mean s to speak openly, usually not to have to worry that you are going to be criti cized, to speak without having to worry about how the other people, perhaps, are reac ting.  Diego says, “Agreed?” meaning do you agree with me, Maya.

Maya says, “Uh, sure.  You’re the boss (you’re the person in charge).  Should I also cancel the lunch I’ve ordered so you can make up your minds about food later?”  “To make up your mind” means to decide, to  make a decision.  Maya’s saying well, maybe we shouldn’t have a planned lunc h; you guys can just decide what you want to eat later.  Diego says, “Absolutel y not!  The one thing that’s not open for discussion is what I’m eating for lunch.”  So, Diego is willing to have people talk about whatever they want, but when it c omes to lunch, deciding what he’s going to eat, he’s going to make a decision.  “To be open for discussion” means that people can give their opinions, it hasn’ t been decided yet.  When it’s not open for discussion, a decision has already bee n made, and apparently Diego has made a decision about what he wants and e veryone else will eat for lunch.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Diego:  Okay, why don’t you brief me on what you’ve  planned for the meeting tomorrow?

Maya:  Sure.  At the meeting of the managers tomorr ow, we’ll begin with introductions.  Since you’re the most senior manage r, the job falls to you.

Diego:  I don’t think we need to stand on ceremony.   Have Alexi do the introductions.

Maya:  All right.  Then, we’ll follow the agenda an d discuss each item of business.  I have you down to lead the discussions.

Diego:  I don’t think we need the meeting to be so structured.  If we follow the agenda point-by-point, we’ll never find out what’s really on the minds of the managers, what issues they think are of paramount i mportance.  I think I’ll open the floor to anyone who wants to raise an issue.

Maya:  Wouldn’t that turn into a free for all?  I’m  not sure we’ll get much accomplished.

Diego:  Sometimes, it’s not as important to accompl ish something as it is to take the pulse of the group.  If we want to know what is sues are on the managers’ minds, we first need to let the managers speak free ly.  Agreed?

Maya:  Uh, sure.  You’re the boss.  Should I also c ancel the lunch I’ve ordered so you can make up your minds about food later?

Diego:  Absolutely not!  The one thing that’s not o pen for discussion is what I’m eating for lunch.

# Getting Political Support

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 757: Getting Political Support.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 757.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Welcome back!

Have you been to our website at eslpod.com?  Have y ou become a Learning Guide member?  If you have, thank you.  If not, tod ay would be a great day to do that.  If you’re on Facebook you can also like us a t facebook.com/eslpod.

This episode is a dialogue using vocabulary related  to politics and getting support – getting money from people to support your politic al campaign.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Helen:  Okay, your schedule today is very busy.  Fi rst, you’re meeting with a group of constituents concerned about the environme nt.  Then, you’re speaking to a group of factory workers.  At noon, you’ll be having lunch with a group of high-power donors.

Mikhail:  When I signed on as a candidate, I had no  idea I’d have to pander to every group out there to gain their support.

Helen:  Don’t think of it as pandering.  Think of it as rallying the troops.  People in this state need a leader and you’re their great whi te hope.

Mikhail:  I decided to run because I wanted to be a  voice of reason in the partisan bickering.  I didn’t sign on to be a poster boy for  my political party.

Helen:  You can make a difference when you get elec ted, but first things first: you need to get elected.  Ready to go?

Mikhail:  What happened to the good old days when a ll you had to do was a little gerrymandering to get elected?

Helen:  I’m glad you brought that up.  Your meeting  with the committee on redistricting is this afternoon at 2:00.

Mikhail:  I’m sorry I asked!

[end of dialogue]

Helen begins by saying to Mikhail, “Okay, your sche dule today is very busy. First, you’re meeting with a group of constituents concerned about the environment.”  Your “constituents” (constituents) a re people that you represent as an elected government official.  A “constituent”  is someone who votes for you and is a person you represent in, say, the Senate o r the House of Representatives or the City Council or any official  government body.  If you are a representative, then the people you represent are y our constituents.  Mikhail has a meeting with his constituents, or at least some of them, who are concerned about the environment.  Helen says, “Then, you’re s peaking to a group of factory workers,” people who work in a company – in a place  where they physically make something.  They may make tables or chairs or those little dresses that people put on their cats, anything like that.  “At noon,” Helen says, “you’ll be having lunch with a group of high-power donors.”  “ High-power” means very important, very influential, very powerful.  A “don or” (donor) is a person who gives money to an organization.  It could be to a p olitical candidate, it could be to a school, it could be to a church, a university; an y of those groups or people could have people who give them money, and those pe ople we would call “donors.”  We have donors here at ESL Podcast, peop le who give us money in order to help us continue, and we very much appreci ate it.  The verb would be, of course, “to donate” (donate).  Donors donate money,  or donations.  You could say, “Donors donate donations.”  “Donations” refers  to the money that donors donate.  Okay, this has nothing to do with doughnut s, which you can have with coffee.

Mikhail says, “When I signed on as a candidate, I h ad no idea I’d have to pander to every group out there to gain their support.”  “ To sign on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to agree to do something, to register or put your name down as someone who will do a certain thing.  Mikhail says when he signed on, when he agreed to be a “candidate,” a person who wants to w in an elected office – an elected position, he had no idea that he would have  to pander (pander).  Here, “to pander” means to be very nice to someone, to do  something that someone wants because you want to get their money or you wa nt to get their support. Politicians do this all the time; they pander to pe ople, they try to be nice to them so that those people will support them or will give  them money.  Interestingly enough, the verb “to pander” is also used to descri be the crime of someone who arranges for you to meet a prostitute, someone we w ould call a “pimp” or a “madam,” so there’s some connection there I think.  Mikhail says that he had no

idea that he had to pander to every group out there  in order to gain their support – to get their support and their money.

Helen says, “Don’t think of it as pandering.”  Pand ering definitely has a negative connotation to it.  “Think of it as rallying the tr oops.”  “To rally” a group of people is to get them excited about something (rally).  the “troops” normally refers to a group of soldiers, someone in the army.  But here, it just refers to the people who are your supporters, who want you to do well, who want to get you elected.  So, “to rally the troops” means to motivate, to encoura ge, to get people excited to do something.  “People in this state,” Helen says, “ne ed a leader and you’re their great white hope.”  The expression “great white hop e” means in general someone who will be a leader, who will achieve grea t things even though it’s difficult, a symbol of something or someone who wil l be great in the future.

Mikhail says, “I decided to run (to participate in these elections) because I wanted to be a voice of reason in the partisan bick ering.”  Mikhail decided to try to become a representative, or elected to whatever this office is that he’s trying to gain, because he wanted to be a voice of reason.  “ Reason” is using your intelligence – your intellect.  “To be a voice of r eason” is to be a person who presents rational, logical ideas, someone who doesn ’t act just emotionally, someone who thinks about what they are doing.  That ’s a “voice of reason.” Mikhail wants to be the voice reason in the partisa n bickering.  “Partisan” (partisan) is when you have very strong opinions of  one political party.  Someone who doesn’t want to change their opinions, who supp orts their political party, and they won’t change their mind; that would be someone  who is “partisan.”  “To bicker” (bicker) means to fight, to disagree, espec ially in a way that isn’t very pleasant – that isn’t very nice.  So “bickering,” a s a noun, would be fighting. Mikhail says, “I didn’t sign on (I didn’t agree) to  be a poster boy for my political party.”  A “poster boy” or a “poster girl,” we migh t even say a “poster child,” is a person who represents an organization, who symboliz es the organization.  It’s sometimes used to refer to someone who is a good ex ample of a certain idea or a certain belief.  Sometimes organizations that are  trying to get money for people who need help, who are sick, for example, from a sp ecific disease, may have pictures of a person who that has that disease on a  piece of paper, a large piece of paper that has their name on it, the name of the  organization, asking for help. Well, a large piece of paper like that is called a “poster,” and that’s where we get the expression “poster boy” or “poster child.”  Mik hail doesn’t want to be a poster boy for his “political party,” for his organization  of members who support a certain political belief.

Helen says, “You can make a difference (that is, yo u can do something important) when you get elected (when people vote f or you so that you win your

position), but first things first.”  The expression  “first things first” means you have to do the most important things first; you have to put things in priority and start with the most important thing first – “first things  first.”  Helen says, “you need to get elected.  Ready to go?”

Mikhail says, “What happened to the good old days w hen all you had to do was a little gerrymandering to get elected?”  “Good old d ays” is an expression referring to the way things used to be, things that you remem ber favorably, you remember them being better than they are right now.  So I ma y say something like, “Oh, the good old days when you could go to the beach and no  one would be talking on their cell phone, or go to a baseball game and ever yone would watch the game instead of texting their friends or waving to the c amera.”  “The good old days,” the days when things were better.  Mikhail says, “W hat happened to the good old days when all you had to do (when the only thing yo u needed to do) was a little gerrymandering?”  “To gerrymander” (gerrymander) is  to make the lines on a map for a specific area of a government representat ive in such a way that you make sure that only certain kinds of people will wi n in that area.  It’s somewhat complicated.  In American politics every 10 years o r so, as the population moves, increases, or decreases, each state has to draw the  boundaries of the elected officials.  So for example, here in Los Angeles we may have seven or eight people that go to Congress representing us.  Each o ne represents a specific area of Los Angeles.  But where you draw the lines divid ing those areas will make a big difference in who gets elected.  “Gerrymanderin g” is drawing those lines in such a way that you guarantee that only a certain k ind of person will get elected, someone from either a conservative political party or a liberal political party, for example.

Helen says, “I’m glad you brought that up (I’m glad  you mentioned that).  Your meeting with the committee on redistricting is this  afternoon at 2:00.” “Redistricting” is that process I just talked about , every 10 years or so where the government – the state governments have to go throu gh and decide where the lines are going to be.  So, that’s exactly what is happening here, “redistricting.” Mikhail says, “I’m sorry I asked!”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Helen:  Okay, your schedule today is very busy.  Fi rst, you’re meeting with a group of constituents concerned about the environme nt.  Then, you’re speaking to a group of factory workers.  At noon, you’ll be having lunch with a group of high-power donors.

# Showing Off a New Purchase

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 758: Showing Off a New Purchase.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 758.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at eslpod.com, download a Learning Guide, improve your English, and win a million dollars – well, two of t hose three things anyway!

This episode is called “Showing Off a New Purchase. ”  It’s a dialogue about a man who’s just bought a new car and wants everyone to know about it.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Monica:  Wow, check you out!  When did you buy a ne w car?

Kevin:  This isn’t just any new car.  It’s a Ferrar i.

Monica:  I can see that.  It must have set you back  a few.

Kevin:  Yeah, but it was worth it.  You should see the looks I get riding around in this baby.  My brother is green with envy.

Monica:  Then you’ve been showing it off around tow n.

Kevin:  No, I’ve just been showing it off to a few friends and family members. There’s no sense owning a fine machine like this an d not bragging a little, right?

Monica:  Especially since your brother has been glo ating about his new boat, you mean.

Kevin:  There is that.  I don’t want to toot my own  horn, but I think a new Ferrari trumps a measly new boat, don’t you?

Monica:  Do you and your brother always whip it out  like this?

Kevin:  Like what?  I’m just sharing my new toy wit h my brother.  I’m sure he’s just as happy for me as I was for him when he bough t his new boat.

 Monica:  Truer words were never spoken.

[end of dialogue]

Monica begins by saying to Kevin, “Wow (which is an  expression of surprise), check you out!”  This is an informal expression: “c heck (check) you out.”  It means look at this person, pay attention to how he or she looks because somehow it is unusual or impressive.  So you come i n with a new shirt or a girl comes in with a new dress, you might say, “Wow, che ck you out!” meaning you’re looking very fancy; you’re wearing impressiv e clothing.  “To check out,” as a phrasal verb, can mean to look at someone perhaps  with some sort of romantic or sexual interest.  “Check out” can also just mean  to investigate.  “Check out” can also be what you do at a store when you are buy ing something.  It has a lot of different meanings, none of which are in the Lea rning Guide!

Monica says, “Check you out.  When did you buy a ne w car?”  Well, now we see that it isn’t what Kevin is wearing, it’s his new c ar that he bought.  Kevin says, “This isn’t just any new car,” meaning it’s not lik e buying a new Ford or a new Toyota; it’s much more important, much more, in thi s case, expensive than that. “It’s a Ferrari.”  A Ferrari is a very expensive, f ast sports car, made in Italy of course.

Monica says, “I can see that,” meaning yes, you don ’t have to tell me, I can see with my own eyes.  “It must have set you back a few ,” Monica says.  “To set (someone) back a few” is an expression meaning to b e very expensive.  It must have cost you a lot of money, that’s what Monica is  saying.  When you buy something expensive, you may say, “Yeah, it set me back a few.”  The phrasal verb “to set back” can mean to put you in a worse s ituation than you were before, in this case a worse situation financially.

Kevin says, “Yeah, but it was worth it,” meaning it  was worthwhile; it was something that was good enough or had a good enough  benefit that you can say okay, well, I think that was a good idea to spend t hat much money or work that hard.  He says, “You should see the looks I get rid ing around in this baby.”  “You should see” means that you would be impressed by the looks, the way people look at him, when he is riding in the car, when he’ s riding around – around the town – in this baby.  “Baby” (baby) here is used to  refer to something you own that you value a lot, that you’re very proud of, pe rhaps that’s very expensive.  It’s not the baby that you have after nine months of bei ng inside the mother, that’s a different kind of baby.  There are a couple of diff erent meanings, actually, of the word “baby,” and those, yes, can be found in the Le arning Guide.

 Kevin says, “My brother was green with envy.”  “To be green with envy” (envy) means to be very envious.  “To be envious” or “to h ave envy” means to want what another person has, to want it very much.  Mon ica says, “Then you’ve been showing it off around town.”  “To show (something) off” or “to show off (something)” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to use or display something in such a way that everybody sees it; you want everyon e to see what, in this case, a wonderful car you have.  Or, you want everyone to  see your new watch; you bought a new watch and you show everyone, “Oh, hey look, here’s my new watch,” you’re showing it off.  As a noun “to be a show off” is a negative way of describing someone who’s always showing other peopl e how good they are, how much money they have, or so on.  A beautiful woman might wear a short dress to show off her legs for example.  I wouldn’t know; I don’t look at other women of course, being married!

Monica says that Kevin has been showing off his new  car.  Kevin says, “No, I’ve just been showing it off to a few friends and famil y members,” not everyone, just friends and family.  Kevin says, “There’s no sense owning a fine machine like this and not bragging a little, right?”  The expression “there’s no sense” (sense) means you are talking about something that doesn’t make sense, that would be wrong or illogical.  There’s no sense going to Disn eyland and not seeing Mickey Mouse.  I mean if you’re going to travel thousands of miles to see Disneyland, you should make sure you see Mickey Mouse.  Tell hi m “hello,” tell him I said “hello.”  I last saw him in 1972, so we haven’t see n each other in a long time!

Anyway, Kevin says, “There’s no sense owning (or ha ving) a fine (a beautiful) machine (in this case, a car) and not bragging a li ttle.”  “To brag” (brag) means to talk about the things you have or the abilities tha t you have that other people don’t have.  It’s considered rude to brag, to say, “Oh, I have so much money and you don’t have any.  I’m so sorry.”  That’s kind of  bragging; you are telling the person about things that they don’t have so that th ey will think you are a better person.  Usually that doesn’t work!  Men like to br ag of course, especially in front of a pretty girl, they want to let them know what a  great person they are.

Well, Kevin is bragging a little with his car.  Mon ica says, “Especially since your brother has been gloating about his new boat, you m ean.”  “To gloat” (gloat) means something similar “to brag,” it means to show  how very proud you are of the things that you have or the things that you’ve done, but do so in sort of a rude way.  When you win a game – you beat the other team  – then you yell at them, “Yeah, you guys were terrible!  We killed you!  We demolished you!  We beat you bad!” that would be gloating.  That also might get you into a fight!  Monica knows that Kevin’s brother recently bought a new boat, a new small ship for a lake or

the ocean, and that his brother has been bragging a bout it – has been gloating about it.  “Gloating” is usually when you have a co mpetition, that’s at least how I think we use the word more commonly.

Kevin says, “There is that.”  That’s a phrase we us e to show that what the other person just said is correct, that they have identif ied another reason why you are doing what you are doing.  So in this case, the rea son that Kevin is bragging is because his brother was bragging earlier about his new boat.  Kevin says, “I don’t want to toot my own horn.”  “To toot (toot) y our own horn (horn)” means to brag about your accomplishments, to tell everyone h ow good you are, how successful you are.  Sometimes, for example, in an American job interview it’s expected that you will toot your own horn a little;  you will tell the person what a good job you did in your other company.  Kevin says , “I think a new Ferrari trumps a measly new boat, don’t you?”  “To trump” ( trump) means to be better than, to be superior than something else.  “Measly”  (measly) means unimportant, insignificant, too small, not very important.  Kevi n is saying that he thinks his new Ferrari is better than the small, insignificant new  boat that his brother has.

Monica then asks, “Do you and your brother always w hip it out like this?”  Here, this very informal expression – not one you would want to use with your boss, for sure – means to brag, to try to show other people t hat you are better than them. Kevin says, “Like what?  I’m just sharing my new to y with my brother.  I’m sure he’s just as happy for me as I was for him when he bought his new boat.”  Kevin is saying he’s not bragging, he’s just letting his brother see his new car knowing that his brother will be happy for him as he was happy for his brother when his brother bought a new boat.  Of course, he wasn’t happy for his brother, and his brother isn’t happy for him!  So it’s true that Kev in is as happy for his brother as his brother is for him, because neither of them are  really very happy for the other at all.

Monica, at the end, uses a famous expression: “True r words were never spoken.” “Truer” means more true.  The phrase is used to sho w that you completely agree with what the other person has just said.  “Truer w ords were never spoken.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Monica:  Wow, check you out!  When did you buy a ne w car?

Kevin:  This isn’t just any new car.  It’s a Ferrar i.

Monica:  I can see that.  It must have set you back  a few.

Kevin:  Yeah, but it was worth it.  You should see the looks I get riding around in this baby.  My brother is green with envy.

Monica:  Then you’ve been showing it off around tow n.

Kevin:  No, I’ve just been showing it off to a few friends and family members. There’s no sense owning a fine machine like this an d not bragging a little, right?

Monica:  Especially since your brother has been glo ating about his new boat, you mean.

Kevin:  There is that.  I don’t want to toot my own  horn, but I think a new Ferrari trumps a measly new boat, don’t you?

Monica:  Do you and your brother always whip it out  like this?

Kevin:  Like what?  I’m just sharing my new toy wit h my brother.  I’m sure he’s just as happy for me as I was for him when he bough t his new boat.

Monica:  Truer words were never spoken.

[end of dialogue]

She never toots her own horn, but she certainly sho uld!  That’s because she’s the most wonderful scriptwriter on the Internet, I think: Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Worrying About Your Children

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 759: Worrying About Your Children.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 759.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Support this podcast by  becoming a member and downloading our Learning Guide for this and all of our current episodes.

This episode is about worrying about your children.   Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pavel:  I’m really worried about Hanna.  She’s been  hanging around with that girl Carla, and Carla runs with the wrong crowd.

Hillary:  Hanna is rebelling a little.  That’s natu ral at her age.  When I was her age, I thought I knew more than my parents or any a dult, and that I should be able to make all of my own decisions.

Pavel:  I’m not talking about being stricter on her , but she’s become so secretive. I’m really worried that she might get exposed to th ings that should be off-limits at her age.

Hillary:  There’s no way we can keep her from seein g her friends short of locking her in her room.  We have to trust her and let her come to us if she runs into problems.  We raised her right and she can handle h erself.

Pavel:  I wish I had your confidence.  She’s a girl , remember?  All kinds of things can happen to girls.

Hillary:  We’ve talked to her a lot about those thi ngs and what we feel are right and wrong.  A lot of things can happen to boys, too , or don’t you remember? Hanna takes after you and she has your brains and r esourcefulness.  Like father, like daughter, so stop worrying so much,

Pavel:  Do you really think she’ll be okay?

Hillary:  Yes, I do.  Take comfort in knowing that she’s just exactly like you. When she has a daughter of her own, she’ll stay up nights worrying, just like you.

Pavel:  That’s small comfort!

[end of dialogue]

Pavel begins by saying to Hillary, “I’m really worr ied about Hanna.  She’s been hanging around with that girl Carla, and Carla runs  with the wrong crowd.”  Pavel is worried about Hanna, his daughter, because she’s  been hanging around with that girl Carla.  “To hang around with” means to sp end your time with, especially your free time, time that you can use however you want.  It isn’t clear what you are doing, there isn’t a clear activity; you’re jus t spending time with that person you’re hanging around with.  Sometimes informally I  think now people might say “I’m just hanging with my friends” instead of “hang ing around,” but they mean the same thing.  Pavel is concerned that his daughter i s hanging around or spending time with a girl named Carla.  Why?  Well, because Carla runs with the wrong crowd.  The expression “to run with the wrong crowd ,” or group of people, is to spend time with people who are not doing good thing s, people that will have a bad influence, in this case, on his daughter.

Hillary says, “Hanna is rebelling a little.”  “To r ebel” (rebel) means to disagree with someone in authority.  To not follow what your  parents or your government or teacher says, that is to rebel.  There’s an a no un, which is “rebellion,” which is the act of rebelling, and the person who rebels is called a “rebel.”  A “rebel,” stress on the first syllable, is the person who reb els; the verb, stress on the second syllable.  Hillary says that Hanna is rebell ing a little, “That’s natural at her age.”  When you say “that’s natural,” here we mean it’s normal, it’s to be expected.  “Natural” has a couple of different mean ings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.  Hillary says, “W hen I was her age (when I was the same age as my daughter), I thought I knew more than my parents or any adult, and that I should be able to make all of  my own decisions.”  This is something that many teenagers, of course, believe.

Pavel says, “I’m not talking about being stricter o n her.”  “To be strict” (strict) means that you have rules, in this case for your ch ildren, and you don’t make any exceptions; they must follow exactly your rules.  T hat’s to be strict with your children.  “Stricter” would be the comparative, to be more strict.  Pavel says that his daughter is becoming secretive.  “Secretive” me ans that you keep secrets, you don’t tell someone about what you are doing, yo u don’t give them any information about what you are doing.  Pavel says, “I’m really worried that she might get exposed to things that should be off-limi ts at her age.”  “To be” or “get

exposed to (something)” means that you have some ex perience with it; you see it or you are aware of it.  “Off-limits” (off-limits) means not permitted, not allowed. You might see a sign in a school saying “The princi pal’s office is off-limits to students.”  You are not allowed there, you are not permitted there.  Pavel is worried that his daughter will be exposed to things  that she shouldn’t be at her young age, that should be off-limits, that she shou ld not see.

Hillary says, “There’s no way we can keep her from seeing her friends short of locking her in her room.”  “To keep her from (doing  something)” means to prevent her, to stop her from doing something.  There’s no way to keep her from seeing her friends short of locking her in her room.  “Sho rt of” here means except or unless, but usually it’s used, as it is here, for a n extreme action, something that you wouldn’t normally do.  “Short of selling their home they don’t see how they can pay their doctor bills.”  There’s no other choi ce.  Well, Hillary is saying that the only way they can keep their daughter from seei ng her friends is to lock her in her room, which they wouldn’t want to do.

Hillary says, “We have to trust her.”  “To trust” m eans to believe that, in this case, the person will act appropriately, will the right t hing – the correct thing.  “We have to trust her and let her come to us if she runs int o problems.”  That is, if she has problems we have to let her ask us – come to us, co me and talk to us, we can’t go and talk to her about it.  I’m not sure if that’ s true, but that’s what Hillary believes.  She says, “We raised her right and she can handle herself.”  “To raise (raise) (someone)” is to take care of and educate s omeone from the time, usually, they’re a baby until they’re an adult.  “T o handle (one’s self)” means to be in control of what you are thinking and what you  are doing, to be able to get through a certain situation, especially if it’s a d ifficult situation.  If someone says, “I can handle myself,” they mean I can do it by mys elf, I don’t need anyone else to help me.

Pavel says, “I wish I had your confidence.”  He doe sn’t the same confidence – the same belief that Hillary does in his daughter.  “She’s a girl, remember?  All kinds of things can happen to girls.”  Hillary says , “We’ve talked to her a lot about those things and what we feel are right and wrong.  A lot of things can happen to boys, too, or don’t you remember?”  Pavel is saying  that a young girl – a teenage girl – could get into more trouble than a teenage b oy.  That may be the opinion of a lot of parents I would guess.  But Hillary, the m other, is saying that boys can get into trouble, too.  Hillary says that she and P avel have talked to Hanna, and Hanna knows what’s right and what’s wrong.

“Hanna,” the mother says, and notice the psychology  here of the mother, her thinking, to try to convince the husband not to wor ry, “Hanna takes after you and

she has your brains and resourcefulness.”  The moth er is saying that Hanna takes after her father.  “To take after” means that  they behave or they are like that person, usually a parent or an older relative.   If the oldest sister likes to swim and youngest sister starts swimming, you might say,  “Well, she takes after her older sister.”  She follows the example of her olde r sister.  In this case, Hanna takes after the father, Pavel, and has his brains a nd resourcefulness.  “She has his brains” means she is as smart as he is.  Of cou rse, Hillary is complimenting – is saying something nice about the father.  She als o says that the father and Hanna are resourceful.  “Resourceful” means that yo u are able to use what is available to you and make the best use of it, to ge t the maximum benefit from whatever you have available.  That’s to be resource ful; the noun is “resourcefulness.”  She then uses a version of a po pular expression; the popular expression is “like father, like son,” meaning the son will behave the way the father does.  But she says, changing the expression , “Like father, like daughter,” meaning the daughter will be like the father, so the father doesn’t have to worry because the daughter is just like he is.  “Stop wor rying so much,” Hillary says.

Pavel says, “Do you really think she’ll be okay?”  Hillary says, “Yes, I do.  Take comfort in knowing that she’s just exactly like you .”  “To take comfort in (something)” means to feel comforted by, to know th at you don’t have to worry because of this piece of information – of this thin g.  “Take comfort in knowing that even if it rains we’re inside a building and we won ’t get wet.”  “To take comfort in” means to get some sort of positive emotion or some,  we might say, reassurance that things are going to be okay.

Hillary says, “When she has a daughter of her own ( when Hanna has a daughter of her own), she’ll stay up nights worrying, just l ike you.”  Well, Pavel doesn’t think this is very comforting, this isn’t very reas suring.  That’s why he ends by saying, “That’s small comfort!”  “Small comfort” me ans it’s not very comforting, it doesn’t help.  It doesn’t really matter that Hanna,  when she grows up and has a daughter, will also worry.  Pavel thinks that isn’t  very reassuring, that isn’t very comforting, and I must agree, he’s probably right.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Pavel:  I’m really worried about Hanna.  She’s been  hanging around with that girl Carla, and Carla runs with the wrong crowd.

Hillary:  Hanna is rebelling a little.  That’s natu ral at her age.  When I was her age, I thought I knew more than my parents or any a dult, and that I should be able to make all of my own decisions.

Pavel:  I’m not talking about being stricter on her , but she’s become so secretive. I’m really worried that she might get exposed to th ings that should be off-limits at her age.

Hillary:  There’s no way we can keep her from seein g her friends short of locking her in her room.  We have to trust her and let her come to us if she runs into problems.  We raised her right and she can handle h erself.

Pavel:  I wish I had your confidence.  She’s a girl , remember?  All kinds of things can happen to girls.

Hillary:  We’ve talked to her a lot about those thi ngs and what we feel are right and wrong.  A lot of things can happen to boys, too , or don’t you remember? Hanna takes after you and she has your brains and r esourcefulness.  Like father, like daughter, so stop worrying so much,

Pavel:  Do you really think she’ll be okay?

Hillary:  Yes, I do.  Take comfort in knowing that she’s just exactly like you. When she has a daughter of her own, she’ll stay up nights worrying, just like you.

Pavel:  That’s small comfort!

# Paycheck Deductions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 760: Paycheck Deductions.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 760.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development – I almost forgot where I was from – oh yeah, beautiful  Los Angeles, California.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide.  You should go to eslpod.com to download it.

This episode is a dialogue between Bill and Carol a bout “paycheck deductions.” This is money that your company takes out of your “ paycheck,” what you get paid every week or every month, for a variety of purpose s.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bill:  It’s about time!  I’ve been waiting for my f irst paycheck and now it’s finally here.  I’m ready to party this weekend!  Whoa!

Carol:  What’s the matter?

Bill:  What happened to all my money?  The amount of this check is a lot less than I expected it to be.

Carol:  Yeah, my first paycheck was an eye-opener f or me, too.  Look at the pay stub and you’ll see all of the deductions.  After f ederal income taxes, state income taxes, and FICA, you’re not left with a lot of money.

Bill:  You’re right, but what’s FICA?

Carol:  Those are taxes for Social Security and Med icare.  Did you sign up for a retirement plan?  If you did, those retirement cont ributions are deducted, too.

Bill:  Thank God, I didn’t.  But you know what?  Th at still doesn’t account for all of the deductions.

Carol:  Let me take a look.  Oh, it looks like your  wages are being garnished.

Bill:  They’re garnishing my wages?  What for?

Carol:  Uh, do you have to pay child support or som ething like that?

Bill:  Oh, yeah, I guess I do.  I’d forgotten about  that.  I guess I’d better change my weekend plans.

Carol:  I guess so.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Bill.  He says, “It’s abou t time!”  “It’s about time” is an expression that usually means that you are happy th at something has finally happened; you’ve been waiting for it for a long tim e.  In fact, you’ve been waiting so long you’ve been a little upset, maybe even angr y that this thing hasn’t happened.  I called my sister the other day and she  didn’t call me back.  I waited a week, I called her again, she didn’t call me back .  Then suddenly, three weeks later, she called me.  I said to her, “Well, it’s a bout time,” meaning I’m happy you called but I’m not happy I had to wait so long.  We ll for Bill, it’s about time that he has finally got a job and is getting paid.  He says , “I’ve been waiting for my first paycheck and now it’s finally here.”  Your “paychec k” is the money that you get for working.  Some people get paid every week, most  people get paid every two weeks, some people only once a month.  Bill says, “ I’m ready to party this weekend,” that is, I’m ready to go out and celebrat e, to have a party.  Then suddenly he says, “Whoa!”  “Whoa” is what you might  say to a horse to stop it, that’s where you hear that expression, but it now m eans more generally that you are surprised by something, that you want to stop t he conversation or to stop what you were talking about because something surpr ising, often negative, has happened.  Carol says, “What’s the matter?”  What’s  wrong?  Bill says, “What happened to all my money (or all of my money)?”  He ’s looking at his paycheck; he sees that the amount that he was paid is less th an he expected.  He says, “The amount of this check is a lot less than I expe cted it to be.”

Carol says, “Yeah, my first paycheck was an eye-ope ner for me, too.”  To say something is an “eye (eye) -opener (opener)” means that it is a very surprising experience, but something that teaches you an impor tant lesson about something.  That’s an eye-opener; it opens your eye s; you suddenly see something you didn’t see before or know something y ou didn’t know before. Carol says, “Look at the pay stub and you’ll see al l of the deductions.”  A “pay stub” (stub) is the document that the company that you work for gives you, in addition to your check, that tells you all of the t hings that were taken out of your check.  It also tells you typically how many hours you worked, how much you got paid for working that number of hours, and so forth .  Nowadays most people don’t get paid with a physical check; many companie s simply send the money

directly to your bank, what we would call “direct d eposit.”  However, most companies still give you a pay stub, or make one av ailable electronically to you, that shows all of the deductions.  A “deduction” is  a noun, it comes from the verb “to deduct” (deduct), which is the same as subtract  or take out of.  “Deductions” are things that the company takes out of your total  pay.

Carol mentions a couple of these deductions.  She s ays, “After federal income taxes, state income taxes, and (FICA)” or “FICA, yo u’re not left with a lot of money.”  “Income taxes” are money that you pay to t he government.  Almost everyone pays some percentage of their money to the  national or federal government.  If you don’t make a lot of money, the government will give you that money back at the end of the year; technically the following year after you file your income tax returns.  That is, you tell the gov ernment how much you made last year, how much you paid in taxes.  Some people  get their money back; many people don’t.  The more money you make the less lik ely you are to get any money back from the government.  In addition to nat ional or federal income taxes, Americans also pay, in most states, a state income tax.  Here in California that can be as high as I think close to 10 percent of the money you make.  The federal income taxes can be as much as 35 percent, depending on how much money you make.  You have to be making a lot of money to be paying the top or maximum amount of 35 percent, however.  Everyone pa ys (FICA) or FICA taxes, (FICA) stands for Federal Insurance Contributions A ct.  Basically, that was a law that required employers to hold part of the money t hat you earn every week or every two weeks, to take some of that and give it t o the government, who uses it for retirement and healthcare purposes.

Bill says, “You’re right, but what’s (FICA)?”  Caro l then explains; she says, “Those are taxes for Social Security and Medicare.”   Those are the two things I just mentioned.  “Social Security” relates to retir ement, for the most part.  That is, when you stop working when you are, say, 65 or 68 y ears old you get some money back from the government.  It’s money, in par t, related to the amount of money you paid in Social Security taxes.  “Medicare ” is money the government gives people who need help paying their medical or hospital and doctor bills. Medicare, like Social Security, was mainly designed  to help people who are old, people who’ve stopped working.  It can also be used , however, to help people who are disabled in some way, who can’t walk for ex ample.  It will also help people who cannot work for some other reason, as we ll.  That’s Social Security and Medicare.  But your pay stub usually doesn’t say Social Security and Medicare, it says (FICA).  Carol says, “Did you sig n up for a retirement plan?”  In addition to Social Security, many people also have their own “retirement plan,” money that they save each paycheck for their retire ment, when they are no

longer working.  So, “retirement contributions” wou ld be money that you are saving yourself for your retirement.

Bill says, “Thank God, I didn’t.”  “Thank God” mean s he’s happy that he didn’t, although someday he may not be happy that he didn’t .  Bill says, “But you know what?  That still doesn’t account for all of the de ductions.”  “To account for” means to explain.  So Bill is saying that he unders tands the income taxes and the (FICA) taxes, but that still doesn’t explain where some of the money has gone, why his paycheck is not as big as he thinks it shou ld be.

Carol says, “Let me take a look.  Oh, it looks like  your wages are being garnished.”  “Wages” (wages) is another word for mo ney that you get every hour for working.  Usually “wages” is a term we use for people who get paid by the hour: they get 12 dollars an hour, 20 dollars an ho ur, 25 dollars an hour.  That’s wages; the more hours you work the more money you m ake.  Another term related to that is “salary” (salary).  A “salary” i s when you get paid one amount, and it doesn’t matter how many hours you work.  The  better the job, the higher the income from the job, typically the more likely you will have a salary and not a wage.  Wages are for when you get paid by the hour,  and the more hours you work the more money you make.  Salary is when you h ave one amount of money, regardless of how many hours you actually wo rk.  Carol says that Bill’s wages have been garnished.  By the way, “wage” is a  word with a couple of different meanings in English.  Go back to the Learning Guide that you downloaded from our website and you can see some ad ditional definitions.

So, Bill’s wages are being garnished.  “To garnish”  (garnish) means the company doesn’t give you all of your money.  It holds some of the money usually because you owe someone else money, and legally they have t o take some of that money and give it to someone else.  Now why would they do  that, you may be asking. Bill asks that as well; he says, “They’re garnishin g my wages?  What for?” meaning why, for what reason.

Carol says, “Uh, do you have to pay child support o r something like that?”  “Child support” is money that you have to pay the typicall y mother of the child, if you’re a man.  It could be that the mother has to pay the father, it depends one who when a couple gets divorced or when they are no lon ger with each other, supporting each other economically, the person who isn’t raising the child primarily has to pay the other person money to pay for the expenses of the child. It could be a baby; it could be anyone up to the ag e of 18.  That’s what child support is.  If you don’t pay child support the oth er person, typically the wife, will go to the court – to the legal system – and they wi ll demand that you pay that money, and they will tell the person you’re working  for they have to take some of

that money and give it to the person who is raising  your child.  That’s what child support is.

Bill says, “Oh, I guess I do,” meaning yes, I do ha ve child support that I have to pay.  He said, “I’d forgotten about that.”  A stran ge thing to forget about!  Bill says, “I guess I’d better change my weekend plans.”   He was going to go out and spend money on drinking or having a party, but now he realizes he doesn’t have very much money so he has to change his plans.  Car ol agrees; she says, “I guess so.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Bill:  It’s about time!  I’ve been waiting for my f irst paycheck and now it’s finally here.  I’m ready to party this weekend!  Whoa!

Carol:  What’s the matter?

Bill:  What happened to all my money?  The amount of this check is a lot less than I expected it to be.

Carol:  Yeah, my first paycheck was an eye-opener f or me, too.  Look at the pay stub and you’ll see all of the deductions.  After f ederal income taxes, state income taxes, and FICA, you’re not left with a lot of money.

Bill:  You’re right, but what’s FICA?

Carol:  Those are taxes for Social Security and Med icare.  Did you sign up for a retirement plan?  If you did, those retirement cont ributions are deducted, too.

Bill:  Thank God, I didn’t.  But you know what?  Th at still doesn’t account for all of the deductions.

Carol:  Let me take a look.  Oh, it looks like your  wages are being garnished.

Bill:  They’re garnishing my wages?  What for?

Carol:  Uh, do you have to pay child support or som ething like that?

Bill:  Oh, yeah, I guess I do.  I’d forgotten about  that.  I guess I’d better change my weekend plans.

 Carol:  I guess so.

# Animals in a Zoo

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 761: Animals in a Zoo.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 761.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there, become a memb er, download a Learning Guide, and support ESL Podcast.

This episode is called “Animals in a Zoo.”  We’re g oing to talk about animals in a zoo.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Deborah:  I can’t wait to see the elephants at the zoo.  I wish I could see them in their natural habitat, but a zoo is the next best t hing.

Zach:  I don’t want to go to a place where animals are kept in captivity.  How would you like it if you were locked in a cage and gawked at all day?

Deborah:  The animals in zoos are lucky.  They have  a nice, safe place to live away from predators, and their handlers make sure t hey never go hungry.  Zoos preserve endangered species.

Zach:  If you think it’s so nice living in zoos, I’ d like to see you switch places with a lion or a monkey for a month and see how you like  it.

Deborah:  Animals aren’t people.  They don’t have t he same wants and needs.

Zach:  That’s what you think.  One day, the animals  aren’t going to take it anymore.  They’ll rise up and break their shackles.

Deborah:  And will you be their ringleader?

Zach:  No, I’ll be their cheering section.  It’s ab out time animals get some respect.

Deborah:  Have you seen Planet of the Apes ?!  I’ll reserve a cage for you!

[end of dialogue]

Deborah begins our dialogue by saying to Zach, “I c an’t wait to see the elephants at the zoo.”  “I can’t wait” means she’s looking fo rward to it; she wants very much to see the elephants at the zoo.  “Elephants” are l arge animals – mammals, technically.  They can typically be found in Africa  as well as in parts of Asia.  I can only think of one famous elephant, that would b e Dumbo from the Disney movie.  Elephants are large, huge animals.  They ha ve long what we call “trunks” that come from the front of their face, like a long  nose, although I think it has functions of both a nose and a mouth, at least some  of them.  Anyway, Deborah wants to see elephants at the zoo.  The “zoo” is a park where there are many animals.  The animals are usually kept in container s we would call “cages.”  They are put in cages in part so they don’t leave, and i n part to protect the people who are looking at them.  Deborah says, “I wish I could  see them (the elephants) in their natural habitat, but a zoo is the next best t hing.”  Your “habitat” (habitat) refers to a place where you live.  “Natural habitat ” for an animal would be the places where you would find them out in the world, not inside of a man-made cage or zoo.  Deborah says, “a zoo is the next best  thing.”  When we say something is “the next best thing” we mean it’s not  the best option – the best possibility, but it’s the second best.

Zach says, “I don’t want to go to a place where ani mals are kept in captivity.” The expression “in captivity” (captivity) means tha t you are held in a certain place and you can’t leave.  If you are a prisoner you may  be said to be held in captivity. Normally we use the expression when talking about a nimals, however.  Animals who are put into cages could be said to be held in captivity or kept in captivity. Zach says, “How would you like it if you were locke d in a cage and gawked at all day?”  Zach doesn’t like zoos; he doesn’t like the fact that the animals are put in cages, so he asks Deborah, “How would you like it i f you were put in a cage.”  A “cage,” as we mentioned, is a large box usually wit h metal bars that prevent the animal inside from leaving.  He asks Deborah how sh e would feel if she were being gawked at all day.  “To gawk (gawk) at (someo ne)” is to stare at them, to look at them for a long time, but sort of in a stup id way, often with your mouth open because it’s so weird – it’s so unusual.  It’s  considered rude or impolite to gawk at people, to look at them, and that’s what Za ch is saying.  To look at someone in such a way as though they were an animal , that would be considered rude.  Sometimes we talk about tourists who come to Los Angeles gawking at celebrities that they might see, famous people, staring at them, looking at them, pointing at them.  That’s somethin g that people who live in Los Angeles usually don’t do, not because they’re not e xcited to see famous people, but because the general rule here is that you don’t  stop a famous person and ask them for their autograph or try to talk to them.  T ypically, you just leave them

alone.  You pretend like you see famous people ever y day and it’s really not that important that you’re seeing them.

Well, Zach doesn’t like zoo; he doesn’t want to go gawk at animals.  Deborah says, however, that the animals in zoos are lucky –  they’re fortunate.  “They have a nice, safe place to live away from predators.”  “ Predators” (predators) here refer to animals that hunt and eat other animals.  If an animal is in a zoo, it doesn’t have to worry about being eaten by predator s.  Deborah says that the animals’ handlers make sure they never go hungry.  A “handler” (handler) in this dialogue means a zookeeper, the person whose job it  is to take care of the animals in the zoo.  Deborah says the handlers make  sure that the animals never go hungry; they always have food to eat.  “Zoos,” s he says, “preserve endangered species.”  A “species” is a type of anim al.  “Endangered” means that it’s possible that the species – the animals of tha t type – might not survive, that we might kill all of them.  “Endangered species” are animals that are in danger because if we don’t protect them there may not be a ny of them anymore.  This happens often when animals are hunted, are caught o r shot with a gun by humans, of course.  Or if something disturbs their habitat – if something changes the place where they’re living they may go extinct.   “To go extinct” (extinct) means that they will no longer exist, that all of t hem will die.  That’s an endangered species, a species that is not extinct b ut is in danger of becoming extinct.

Zach says, “If you think it’s so nice living in zoo s, I’d like to see you (Deborah) switch places with a lion or a monkey for a month a nd see how you like it.”  “To switch places” means to go in the place of someone else, to exchange your place for his place.  Zach is saying that she should swit ch places with a “lion,” which is a very large, cat-like animal.  And because it’s ca t-like, you probably can guess I don’t really like lions!  Zach mentions monkeys.  “ Monkeys” are small, human-like animals, we could say.  They have long arms and leg s, and they can go and hold onto things with their hands.  They can swing, we w ould say, jump from tree to tree for example.

Deborah says, “Animals aren’t people.  They don’t h ave the same wants and needs.”  Zach says, “That’s what you think.”  That expression, “that’s what you think,” means I disagree with you.  You think that but you don’t know the truth, that’s what the expression is trying to communicate  here.  Zach says, “One day, the animals aren’t going to take it anymore,” meani ng they’re not going to tolerate, they’re not going to permit, they’re not going to stand being in cages. They’re going to get mad, if you will, and they’re going to break out of their cages – leave them.  Zach says, “They’ll rise up and brea k their shackles.”  “To rise up” is a phrasal verb meaning to fight against the peop le or the organizations with

authority that have been treating you badly.  When you have a revolution, the people rise up; they get rid of the government they  have now.  “Shackles” (shackles) are things that you put on a prisoner’s feet so they won’t run away. “To break your shackles” means to take these off so  you can escape – you can run away.  Zach is saying that the animals are goin g to rise up and break their shackles, meaning they’re going to get their freedo m from the zoo.

Deborah says, “And will you be their ringleader?”  She’s asking Zach if he will be the person who leads these animals.  A “ringleader”  is usually someone who is the responsible person for a revolution or a rebell ion.  Zach says, “No, I’ll be their cheering section.”  “To cheer” (cheer) here means t o encourage, by yelling or shouting or clapping your hands, some team, usually  a sports team that you want to win a game.  But in this case, the “cheering sec tion” refers to people who would support a certain activity.  They’re not doing it themselves, but they are encouraging other people to do it, and that’s what Zach would do if the animals rose up and broke their shackles, as he says.  He s ays, “It’s about time animals get some respect.”  “It’s about time” means now is the time, it has been too long, we should be giving animals now some respect.

Deborah says, “Have you seen Planet of the Apes ?!”  Planet of the Apes  is a movie – a 1968 movie with a famous actor named Char lton Heston.  In the movie the animals, specifically the apes which is a kind of animal similar to a monkey, not exactly the same, who are ruling the planet.  T he apes are now in control and the humans are the ones who are in the cages.  Debo rah asks if Zach has seen this movie, because in the movie the humans don’t g et very good treatment, that’s why she says at the end, “I’ll reserve a cag e for you!”  “To reserve” means to set aside, to say this person can use it at this  time.  But Deborah is really saying that if the animals rise up – if the animals  take over the world humans will not be treated very well and Zach will have to be i n a cage just like the animals are now.  It won’t be a very happy situation she sa ys.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Deborah:  I can’t wait to see the elephants at the zoo.  I wish I could see them in their natural habitat, but a zoo is the next best t hing.

Zach:  I don’t want to go to a place where animals are kept in captivity.  How would you like it if you were locked in a cage and gawked at all day?

Deborah:  The animals in zoos are lucky.  They have  a nice, safe place to live away from predators, and their handlers make sure t hey never go hungry.  Zoos preserve endangered species.

Zach:  If you think it’s so nice living in zoos, I’ d like to see you switch places with a lion or a monkey for a month and see how you like  it.

Deborah:  Animals aren’t people.  They don’t have t he same wants and needs.

Zach:  That’s what you think.  One day, the animals  aren’t going to take it anymore.  They’ll rise up and break their shackles.

Deborah:  And will you be their ringleader?

Zach:  No, I’ll be their cheering section.  It’s ab out time animals get some respect.

Deborah:  Have you seen Planet of the Apes ?!  I’ll reserve a cage for you!

This episode is a dialogue about having dinner with  a large number of people. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

My roommate, Jim, invited me over to his house for a family meal.  I’m an only child, so I’m not used to a big family dinner.  I f elt like a fish out of water. …

Jim’s mother:  Sit down, everybody.  Dinner’s ready .

Phil:  Thank you for having me over, Mrs. Moreno.

Jim’s mother:  Don’t mention it.  Just sit down and  eat.  Jim, pass the potatoes, and Dana, don’t hog the peas.  Hand them both to Ph il.

Phil:  Thank you, Mrs. Moreno, but I’ve already tak en a helping of each dish.

Jim’s mother:  Then you need to have seconds.  You’ re too skinny.  Eat up!

Phil:  This food is really good, but I don’t think I have the appetite for more.  My plate is already overloaded.

Jim’s mother:  All right, no more potatoes or peas,  but you need more ham. Laura, serve Phil some more ham, and Jason, round u p some more rolls.

Phil:  No, no, please.  I really couldn’t eat more than what’s already on my plate.

Jim’s mother:  Don’t be ridiculous.  I know you’re saving room for dessert. There’s an apple pie, a strawberry shortcake, a che esecake, and some ice cream. …

I now know why Jim only comes home for meals every once in a while.  Eating like this more than once a week would give anybody a coronary!

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with Phil saying that his roommate , the person that he lives with, Jim, invited him over – invited him to his ho use for a family meal, a meal – a dinner with the other members of, in this case, Jim ’s family.  Phil says that he was, or is, an only child, meaning that his parents  only had one child, him, so he is not used to – he’s not familiar with a big famil y dinner.  He said, “I felt like a fish out of water.”  The expression “a fish out of water ” is used to describe someone who is very uncomfortable or in a situation that th ey are not used to being in, they are in a very different kind of environment than the one they are used to.  I grew up in a big family, so a big family meal would not make me uncomfortable.  But if I go to a house that has a very small family I migh t feel like a fish out of water. Fish, of course, normally are in water, and if they  go out of water, well, sometimes they die.  In fact, I think pretty often the fish will die out of water!

Well, Phil doesn’t die, but he does have an interes ting experience.  He goes to Jim’s house, and Jim’s mother says, “Sit down, ever ybody.  Dinner’s ready.”  We are ready to eat.  Phil says, “Thank you for having  me over, Mrs. Moreno.”  “To have (someone) over” means to have someone come to your house for a short time to visit and usually to eat.  Phil says, “Thank you for having me over, Mrs. Moreno.”  And Mrs. Moreno, who is, of course, Jim’s  mother, says, “Don’t mention it.”  We use this phrase “don’t mention it”  to mean sort of you’re welcome.  We’re saying that you don’t have to thank  me, it was nothing, it’s no big deal – don’t mention it.

She says, “Just sit down and eat.  Jim, pass the po tatoes, and Dana, don’t hog the peas.”  “To pass (something),” as a verb, in th is case means to take the dish that has the food and give it to the person usually  next to you so he or she can get food for themselves.  Although in some families , one person, often the mother, will put the food on the plate for everyone , it’s more common that you have all of the plates of food – all of the dishes on a large table and people pick them up and they give them to the person next to th em – they pass them to the person next to them.

Jim’s mother is telling him to pass the potatoes, a nd Dana, who we guess is her daughter, “Don’t hog (hog) the peas.”  “To hog” as a verb means to use all of something without having anyone else use it.  Or, t o take up all the time with something and not let anyone else have time with it .  Your parents might tell you not to hog the TV.  Or as parents, you may tell you r children, “You’re hogging the TV.  I want to watch something now.”  You’re spendi ng too much time with that and you’re not letting me do it.  Dana is hogging t he peas, meaning she’s not passing them to other people.  I think that’s what Jim’s mother means.  She also says, “Hand them both to Phil.”  “To hand (somethin g) to (someone)” means to give them that thing.  In this case, to give the po tatoes and the peas to Phil, who is, of course, the guest that they have invited ove r.

Phil says, “Thank you, Mrs. Moreno, but I’ve alread y taken a helping of each dish.”  A “helping,” as a noun, is a serving; it’s the amount of food that you take and put on your plate to eat.  That’s a helping (he lping).  You could have a large helping, you could have a small helping, depending on how much food you want to eat.  Phil has already taken a helping of the po tatoes and the peas, of each dish.  A “dish” is, in this case, a type of food th at has been prepared.  You could have potatoes and vegetables and meat, each of thos e would be a dish.  The word “dish,” as a noun, can also mean the plate tha t you are using to eat off of, or more commonly the container that the food is kep t in.  So you put all of the potatoes into a large bowl, we could say into a lar ge dish.  “Dish” has a couple of somewhat confusing meanings here.

Jim’s mother says, “Then you need to have seconds.”   “Seconds” (seconds) is a second helping, or additional food.  You’ve already  had some potatoes and your mother says, “You need to have seconds,” you need t o have even more potatoes, a second helping of potatoes.  Jim’s moth er thinks Phil needs to have seconds because he’s too skinny, he’s too thin.  Ki nd of like me!  Jim’s mother says, “Eat up!”  This expression – informal – “eat up” means go ahead and start eating, eat everything that we are giving you.  It’ s a phrase that is used to encourage people to eat more or to start eating.

Phil says, “This food is really good, but I don’t t hink I have the appetite for more.” “Appetite” (appetite) is your desire to eat food, o r how much food you want to eat right now.  If you say, “I have a big appetite,” th at means you are very hungry, you want to eat a lot of food.  If you don’t have m uch of an appetite, that means you’re not very hungry at all.  Phil says that he d oesn’t think he has the appetite for more food; he can’t eat any more.  He says, “My  plate is already overloaded.” “To be overloaded” means to have too much of someth ing, usually more than what the container can hold, or the plate can hold.   To be overloaded with food means to have too much food, more than you can eat.

 Jim’s mother says, “All right, no more potatoes or peas, but you need more ham.” “Ham,” of course, is a type of meat from a pig.  “L aura, serve Phil some more ham.”  “To serve (someone)” in this case means to p ut food on their plate.  “I will serve you,” I will put the food that you need on yo ur plate.  We talk about waiters and waitresses in restaurants as servers; they are the people who are serving you – who are giving you the food, or at least brin g it from the kitchen to your table.  Jim’s mother tells Laura to serve Phil some  more ham, and Jason is told to round up more rolls.  “To round up,” as a phrasa l verb, means to find something and bring it back.  Go out to the kitchen  or go to the store and round up some more milk or round up some more bread.  You  go and get more of that and you bring it back.  Jason is supposed to round up some more rolls.  “Rolls” are small pieces of bread that you eat with your me al.

Phil says, “No, no, please.  I really couldn’t eat more than what’s already on my plate.”  Phil says he can’t eat any more.  Jim’s mo ther says, “Don’t be ridiculous.” She’s saying don’t be silly, that’s not right.  “I know you’re saving room for dessert.”  “To save room for,” when we’re talking a bout eating, means not to eat too much because you want to also be able to eat so mething else that comes later, in this case dessert – the sweet.  Jim’s mot her says that Phil is saving room for dessert.  She says, “There’s an apple pie, a st rawberry shortcake, which is strawberries on top of a small, little cake; a chee secake, cake made out of cheese, of course; and some ice cream.

After the meal, Phil says, “I know now why Jim only  comes home for meals every once in a while.”  “Every once in a while” means oc casionally, not very often, not frequently.  “Eating like this more than once a wee k would give anybody a coronary!”  “Coronary” (coronary) here means a hear t attack.  It’s an informal term referring to when your heart stops beating.  I f you eat a lot of unhealthy food that may give you high cholesterol, which could eve ntually lead to you having a coronary or a heart attack, and that’s what Phil is  suggesting here.  Notice that Phil doesn’t thank Jim’s mother for all the work th at she has done making the meal.  Instead, he’s worried about a heart attack.  Well, too bad Phil!  Next time make your own meal!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

My roommate, Jim, invited me over to his house for a family meal.  I’m an only child, so I’m not used to a big family dinner.  I f elt like a fish out of water. …

# Dealing with an Apartment Super

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 763: Dealing with an Apartment Super.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 763.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between George and Louis e.  It’s about having problems in your apartment and calling the person w ho’s responsible for fixing things in an apartment building, the super.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

George:  Did you call the super about fixing the le aky faucet?

Louise:  I called him on Monday, but I haven’t hear d back yet.

George:  Well, call him again.  This window is stuc k and it won’t close.

Louise:  I’ll call him, but I think he’s avoiding o ur calls.

George:  He’s the worst super we’ve ever had.  He’s  in charge of the maintenance around this place, but instead, he hide s out in his apartment. Whenever there’s a problem, he tells us he’s too bu sy to get to it right away.  Too busy doing what, I’d like to know.

Louise:  Maybe he is overworked.  There are 25 unit s in this building, so it’s conceivable that he’s busy making repairs – somewhe re.

George:  That’s what he’s counting on, people like you who give him the benefit of the doubt.  All the while he’s drinking coffee a nd reading the newspaper somewhere.  Mark my words.

Louise:  I’ll call him again.  Maybe we’ll catch hi m in his apartment.

George:  Save your energies.

Louise:  Where are you going and what are you doing  with that baseball bat?

George:  I’m going to track down that super and bri ng him back here.  Come hell or high water, he’s making those repairs – today!

[end of dialogue]

George begins our dialogue by asking Louise, “Did y ou call the super about fixing the leaky faucet?”  The word “super” is short for “ superintendent.”  A “superintendent,” in this case, is a person who is responsible for fixing any problems that you have in an apartment building.  S o if you have, as does George and Louise, a leaky faucet, you would call t his person and they would be responsible for fixing it or bringing someone in to  fix it.  A “faucet” is where the water comes out in a sink.  If it’s “leaky,” that m eans water is coming out slowly even when it’s not supposed to.

Louise says that she called the super on Monday, bu t that she hasn’t heard back yet.  “To hear back from (someone)” means to receiv e a message back from someone that you have tried to contact.  Either you  sent an email, or you’ve written a letter, or you called someone.  They were  supposed to call you back, or write you back, and you have not yet gotten a respo nse.  You haven’t heard back yet.

George says, “Well, call him again.  The window is stuck and it won’t close.”  The window won’t close down all the way, and that’s wha t George means when he says it’s stuck.  It could be stuck (stuck) open, m eaning you can’t close it, or it could be stuck closed, meaning you can’t open the w indow.  Louise says, “I’ll call him, but I think he’s avoiding our calls,” meaning he’s not answering his phone on purpose.  He’s doing it intentionally, we might say , because he doesn’t want to talk to us.

George says, “He’s the worst super we’ve ever had.  He’s in charge of the maintenance around this place, but instead, he hide s out in his apartment.” “Maintenance” is the work that you need to keep som ething in good condition, or to make sure it doesn’t get worse than it is right now.  So in an apartment building, you might need to paint the walls every f ew years, or clean the carpets. You need to make sure the plumbing is working prope rly, the heating and/or air conditioning is working okay.  All of these things may require maintenance; you may have to do something to make sure they’re worki ng correctly.  George says that the super hides out in his apartment.  “To hid e (hide) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to spend your time where no on e else can see you.  It can mean, also, to be quiet, to remain hidden so that no one can find you.  In this

case, the super is hiding out in his apartment.  He ’s there and he doesn’t want anyone to know he’s there perhaps.  George says, “W henever there’s a problem, he tells us he’s too busy to get to it right away.”   If there’s a problem the super says, “Oh, no.  I’m sorry.  I’m busy.  I can’t do it right now.  I can’t get to it,” meaning I can’t do what I need to do right now for that problem.  George says, “Too busy doing what, I’d like to know,” meaning wh at is he doing that makes him so busy.

Louise says, “Maybe he is overworked.”  “Overworked ” means that you have too many things to do at your job; the boss has given y ou too much to do.  That’s how I feel; I feel overworked!  Louise says, “There  are 25 units in this building, so it’s conceivable he’s busy making repairs – somewhe re.”  A “unit” (unit) in this situation means an apartment or a condominium in a large building.  If there are 25 apartments in your building, we’d say there are 25 units; it’s the same thing. Louise says, “it’s conceivable (meaning it’s possib le, it’s not likely but it could be) that he’s busy making repairs (he’s busy fixing thi ngs) somewhere else.”

George says, “That’s what he’s counting on.”  That’ s what he’s depending on, that’s what he’s relying on.  “He’s counting on peo ple like you who give him the benefit of the doubt.”  The expression “to give (so meone) the benefit of the doubt” means to assume the most positive thing when  you don’t have all the information about what is happening, especially whe n there’s a problem or you think there might be a problem.  So you call a plum ber to come over and fix something in your bathroom, and the plumber doesn’t  call you and they’re late. They’re supposed to be there at 9:00; it’s 10:00, 1 1:00, still no plumber.  The plumber doesn’t come; the plumber doesn’t call.  No w you could get angry, saying, “Oh, that terrible plumber.  He’s lazy,” or , “He’s not a very good business person.”  But, if you were to give him the benefit of the doubt you would think of another reason – a better excuse.  Maybe he got int o a car accident.  Maybe there was a lot of traffic on the freeway, and he f orgot his cell phone at home. Maybe he was appointed ambassador to Zimbabwe and i s busy in Washington meeting with the president.  You see there are all sorts of reasons why the plumber might not come on time.  That’s giving some one the benefit of the doubt.

George says, “All the while (meaning at this time, while he is saying the same thing) he’s drinking coffee and reading the newspap er somewhere.”  So he’s not really busy; he’s just relaxing somewhere reading t he newspaper.  Then George says, “Mark my words.”  The expression “mark (mark)  my words” is used to emphasize that what you have just said – what you h ave just told another person will come true, to remember that in the future.  “M ark my words, the plumber went to a bar and got drunk.”  That’s what happened .  You’re saying that you

don’t know that, probably, but that’s sort of your prediction.  You want the person that you’re talking to to remember what you’re sayi ng.

Louise says, “I’ll call him again.  Maybe we’ll cat ch him in his apartment.”  “To catch (someone)” in this case means to find someone  before they leave, calling someone before they leave their apartment or before  they leave their office. “Catch” has a couple of different meanings in Engli sh; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.  George, however, says, “S ave your energies.”  “Save your energies” or “save your energy” is an informal  phrase used to tell someone not to do something because it won’t be necessary o r because it won’t really help the situation.

Louise says, “Where are you going and what are you going to do with that baseball bat?”  A “baseball bat” is used in the gam e of baseball, of course, to hit the ball.  Some people keep baseball bats in their houses as a form of defense, as a weapon to protect themselves, to hit someone w ho may come in and try to steal something from your house.  It’s cheaper and less dangerous than a gun.

Well, George says that he’s going to track down the  super and bring him back here.  “To track (track) (someone) down” means to f ind them, especially if it is difficult to find them.  Perhaps they’re hiding or they’re lost.  George says, “Come hell or high water, he’s making those repairs – tod ay!”  The expression “come hell or high water” is an old one, which means no m atter what happens, no matter how difficult the situation is I’m going to do this, or, in this case, I’m going to get the super to come back and fix the problems in the apartment no matter what – no matter what happens, come hell or high wa ter.  George, of course, is potentially going to use violence here; we might ha ve to have another dialogue called getting out of jail or prison after beating someone with a baseball bat!  I hope not.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

George:  Did you call the super about fixing the le aky faucet?

Louise:  I called him on Monday, but I haven’t hear d back yet.

George:  Well, call him again.  This window is stuc k and it won’t close.

Louise:  I’ll call him, but I think he’s avoiding o ur calls.

George:  He’s the worst super we’ve ever had.  He’s  in charge of the maintenance around this place, but instead, he hide s out in his apartment. Whenever there’s a problem, he tells us he’s too bu sy to get to it right away.  Too busy doing what, I’d like to know.

# Being Unsure and Unready

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 764: Being Unsure and Unready.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 764.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can also like  us on Facebook at facebook.com/eslpod, and you can follow us on Twitt er @elspod, and you can…well, you get the idea!

This episode talks about not being sure, not being certain, and not being ready. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Aida:  When our bigwigs from the Cleveland office a rrive next week, I think we’ll have a lot to show them.

Dale:  I wouldn’t be so sure about that.  Giselle t old me yesterday that it’s a toss up whether she’ll finish the program she’s working on by next week, but don’t quote me on that.

Aida:  I thought she was already done with it.

Dale:  I think that she’s still tinkering with it b ecause she isn’t 100 percent sure she’s worked out all of the bugs.

Aida:  All right.  I hope she gets a move on and fa st.  I’ll still have Joe’s prototype to show them, right?

Dale:  Well, the last time I spoke with Joe, he sai d that the prototype is still a work in progress.  Whether it’ll actually work is i ffy, at best.

Aida:  Are you trying to tell me that we’re not rea dy for this visit at all?

Dale:  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I w ouldn’t count on having much to show them, sorry.

Aida:  Then, what am I supposed to do when they wan t to see the progress on our work?

Dale:  I suggest some fast-talking and fancy tap da ncing!

[end of dialogue]

Aida says to Dale, “When our bigwigs from the Cleve land office arrive next week, I think we’ll have a lot to show them.”  A “bigwig”  (bigwig – one word) is an important person.  A supervisor, a boss, maybe the owner of the company, those are bigwigs.  Aida says that when our bigwigs from the Cleveland office – from the office in another city, in this case Cleveland,  Ohio, a state in the eastern half of the United States in the northern part – when th ese bigwigs arrive from the Cleveland office next week, “I think we’ll have a l ot to show them,” she says.

Dale says, “I wouldn’t be so sure about that,” mean ing I’m not sure, you shouldn’t think that.  “Giselle told me yesterday that it’s a  toss up whether she’ll finish the program she’s working on by next week, but don’t qu ote me on that.”  A “toss up” (toss up – two words) is something that may or may not happen.  The verb “to toss” means to throw.  And often, if we want to dec ide by chance or by luck some decision we may take a coin, a small piece of money , and toss it up in the air and depending on which side it lands on that will be the answer to our question – that will be the solution to our problem.  That’s a toss  up, but in general the term is used to express something that is not sure.  We’re not sure, it could happen, it might not happen.  Giselle is not sure that she’s g oing to finish the program, whatever that is she’s working on, “but don’t quote  me on that,” Dale says.  The expression “don’t quote (quote) me on that” is used  to share information that is secret but you don’t want other people to know that  you gave them that information – don’t tell people I told you that, th at’s one use of it.  It can also be used when you’re just not sure that something is go ing to happen; you’re making a prediction.  “I think the Dodgers will win the Wo rld Series of baseball next year, but don’t quote me on that,” I could be wrong.

Aida says, “I thought she (Giselle) was already don e with it.”  Dale says, “I think she’s still tinkering with it because she isn’t 100  percent sure she’s worked out all of the bugs.”  “To tinker (tinker) with (something) ” means to make small changes in it to improve it or to make it better.  Usually it’s used when those efforts – those changes aren’t really very important or perhaps are n’t even successful.  “One hundred percent sure” means absolutely, completely certain, no doubt.  “To work out (something)” means to fix a problem, to resolve  a problem, or to resolve an issue.  “Bugs” (bugs) are errors in computer progra ms.  “Bug” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our L earning Guide for some of

those.  Here, though, it means some sort of mistake  in a computer software program.  Dale says that Giselle is still tinkering  with the program because she isn’t 100 percent sure she’s worked out, or fixed, all of the bugs or problems.

Aida says, “All right (okay).  I hope she gets a mo ve on and fast.”  “To get a move on (something)” means to work on something quickly,  to try to do it as fast as possible because you need to get it done soon.  She  hopes that Giselle will get a move on means she’ll start working on it fast.  “I’ ll still have Joe’s prototype to show them, right?”  A “prototype” (prototype) is a model, it’s something you make or a company makes to decide whether they want to make more of it.  You make one, and you look at it and you say, “Well, maybe we’ll change this or change that,” or maybe, “This is exactly what we want.  Le t’s make some more.” Prototype is like the first example of that particu lar thing.  Aida is saying to Dale that they have a prototype – Joe’s prototype, Joe w ould be the person who made it – to show the bigwigs next week, even if Giselle  isn’t finished with her program.

Dale said, “Well, the last time I spoke with (or I talked with) Joe, he said that the prototype is still a work in progress.”  When we ca ll something “a work in progress” (progress) we mean that it isn’t finished  yet; it’s still being developed; it’s still being changed or improved.  Dale says, “ Whether it’ll actually work is iffy, at best.”  Dale isn’t sure if Joe’s prototype, I gu ess of this program, will actually work.  He says it’s iffy (iffy).  “Iffy” is a somew hat informal word meaning uncertain, not exactly sure, questionable; it might , it might not.  The expression “at best” means the most optimistic way of thinking  or looking at the situation, the most positive way.  So, if we think in the most pos itive way possible, it might work or it might not.  Of course, that means it probably  won’t work!

Aida says, “Are you trying to tell me that we’re no t ready for this visit at all (not in any way)?”  Dale says, “I hate to be the bearer of bad news.”  “To bear (bear) (something),” as a verb, means to carry.  The “bear er” is the person who is carrying something.  At a wedding, you might have a  “ring-bearer,” usually a small boy – a young boy who carries the rings of the two people getting married up to the couple that is getting married; that’s a ring-bearer.  But here, the word “bearer” is part of a common expression meaning som eone who brings you bad news, someone who gives you some unfortunate or sad  information.  Dale says, “I wouldn’t count on having much to show them, sorr y.”  “To count on” means to rely on, to depend on.  Dale says that he wouldn’t count on – he wouldn’t rely on having very much to show the bigwigs next week.

Well, of course, Aida isn’t very happy; she says, “ Then, what am I supposed to do when they see the progress on our work?” meaning , of course, they haven’t made very much progress.  Dale says, “I suggest som e fast-talking and tap

dancing!”  “Fast-talking” is when you talk in such a way as to mislead the person listening to you, or distract them.  When you want to hide something, you start saying this and you start saying that and you try t o sort of confuse the person so that they’re not really sure what’s happening.  “Ta p dancing” is a type of dancing, where you have little pieces of metal on your shoes  that make noise as you hit the ground.  But here, it’s used as an expression t o mean something similar to “fast-talking.”  You’re doing something that will d istract, that will put the attention of the person listening or watching you somewhere e lse so that they won’t think about the real problem that you’re trying to hide.  There aren’t a lot of people who do tap dancing anymore; it was popular in the 20 th  century.  I actually took tap dancing lessons when I was in second grade.  I must  have been, oh, eight or nine years old.  True story!  Maybe someday I’ll ma ke a video of myself tap dancing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Aida:  When our bigwigs from the Cleveland office a rrive next week, I think we’ll have a lot to show them.

Dale:  I wouldn’t be so sure about that.  Giselle t old me yesterday that it’s a toss up whether she’ll finish the program she’s working on by next week, but don’t quote me on that.

Aida:  I thought she was already done with it.

Dale:  I think that she’s still tinkering with it b ecause she isn’t 100 percent sure she’s worked out all of the bugs.

Aida:  All right.  I hope she gets a move on and fa st.  I’ll still have Joe’s prototype to show them, right?

Dale:  Well, the last time I spoke with Joe, he sai d that the prototype is still a work in progress.  Whether it’ll actually work is i ffy, at best.

Aida:  Are you trying to tell me that we’re not rea dy for this visit at all?

Dale:  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I w ouldn’t count on having much to show them, sorry.

Aida:  Then, what am I supposed to do when they wan t to see the progress on our work?

Dale:  I suggest some fast-talking and fancy tap da ncing!

# Annulling a Marriage

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 765: Annulling a Marriage.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 765.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Hey, It’s a new  song!

This episode is a dialogue about two people who are  going to end their marriage, but they’re not getting a divorce.  Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Courtney:  Did you hear?  Kate and Christopher are trying to annul their marriage.

Ray:  What?!  They’ve only been married for two mon ths!  What brought this on?

Courtney:  I have no idea.  Neither of them is unde rage or bigamists and they married of their own free will, so I don’t know how  they can ask for an annulment.

Ray:  I’ve heard that you can get an annulment if t here’s some kind of fraud. Maybe they’re asking for the annulment on those gro unds.

Courtney:  Maybe.  I wish I knew more.  Ooh, could they be related by blood and didn’t know it?  It’s sounding more and more like a  soap opera.

Ray:  I suppose we shouldn’t speculate.  It’s sad w hen any marriage ends, even if it only lasted two months.  Something must be re ally, really wrong.

Courtney:  Or else…

Ray:  Or else, what?

Courtney:  Or else, Christopher finally figured out  what a witch Kate is.

Ray:  Oh, somebody’s a little catty today.  Do I de tect some jealousy here?

Courtney:  Me?  Jealous of Kate?  Forget it!  I’ve known her for years and I just wouldn’t wish her on my worst enemy!

[end of dialogue]

Courtney begins our dialogue by saying, “Did you he ar?  Kate and Christopher are trying to annul their marriage.”  “To annul” (a nnul) means to end some sort of agreement or contract between two people; you’re sa ying that there was some problem with the contract, that something went wron g and that the agreement or contract should never have been made to begin with.   It was, in some ways, flawed; there was a problem with it from the very b eginning.  Well, marriage is a kind of legal contract.  “To annul a marriage” mean s to end a marriage not because you are getting a divorce.  What you are sa ying is that the marriage was never valid, it was never correctly done; there was  some problem that prevented it from being a real, valid, legal marriage.  In the United States, you may know, when you get married you can get married by someone  from the government or you can get married in a religious ceremony, which also makes you legally married.  So, you can have a religious and public w edding all at one time.

There are three ways you can end a marriage.  You can get a divorce, this is the most common way; this says I was married but I no l onger want to be married. You have to get a divorce from the government; a re ligious organization cannot give you a divorce.  You can have a marriage annull ed.  When you have a marriage annulled you’re saying that there was some  problem with the marriage, that it was never really a legal marriage.  You can  also end your marriage by killing your husband or wife.  I believe this is so metimes known as an “Italian divorce,” although I haven’t tried it!

Kate and Christopher are going to annul their marri age, not get a divorce – and I guess not kill each other!  Ray says, “What?!  They ’ve only been married for two months!”  Imagine two people getting married and th en ending their marriage in only two months.  That would never happen, right?!  Ray says, “What brought this on?”  The expression “What brought this on?” m eans you don’t understand why something has happened.  It’s very unexpected, and you’re asking why. Why did this happen?

Courtney says, “I have no idea (I don’t know).  Nei ther of them is underage.”  “To be underage” means that you are too young to do som ething.  In the United States, you must be 21 years old to drink alcohol i n a bar.  If you try to drink when you are less than that you are considered unde rage; you’re not old enough. To be underage to get married depends on the state;  in some states it’s 18 without getting permission from your parents.  In s ome states it might be 16, it

depends on where you live.  Marriage laws are taken  care of or are made by each individual state, so there are 50 different ty pes of laws, although most of them are similar.  Being underage, however, could m ean that the marriage wasn’t legal and therefore you could annul it, you could say it never existed. Courtney says that neither of them is underage or i s, I think she means to say, a bigamist.  A “bigamist” (bigamist) is someone who i s illegally married to more than one person.  So, you have a wife in New York a nd then you have another wife in London or another wife in Los Angeles.  Tha t would be being a bigamist. It’s called “bigamy,” and it’s against the law in t he United States.  Courtney says that Kate and Christopher married of their own free  will.  The expression “of your own free will” (will) means that no one forced you to do it, it was your choice. She says, “I don’t know how they can ask for an ann ulment.”  You can only get an annulment if certain conditions exist, otherwise  you have to get a regular divorce.

Ray says, “I’ve heard that you can get an annulment  if there’s some kind of fraud.”  “Fraud” (fraud) is when you lie or mislead  other people, usually to get some sort of money from them.  Ray says, “Maybe the y’re asking for an annulment on those grounds.”  “On (some) grounds” m eans for some reason. “Grounds” is a reason, usually a legal reason for s omething.  You say, “I have grounds for divorce,” meaning I have legal reasons why I can divorce you, because you stole my money or you cheated on me, yo u went and had some relationship with another man or another woman.  Th at would be grounds for divorce.

Courtney says, “Maybe.  I wish I knew more.  Ooh, c ould they be related by blood and didn’t know it?”  “To be related by blood ” means that you are part of the same family.  You’re part of the same family we  would say “through birth,” not marriage.  So for example you have an aunt, your mo ther’s sister has a boy, and you’re a girl, the two of you are then called “firs t cousins.”  Well, you can’t get married because you’re related to each other by blo od.  You can also be related to someone by marriage.  I would call my father’s b rother’s wife my aunt – my uncle’s wife would be my aunt, but she’s my aunt by  marriage, not by blood.  I’m not genetically related to her.  If two people are related by blood, especially if they’re first cousins, they are not allowed to get married.

Courtney says, “It’s sounding more and more like a soap opera.”  A “soap opera” is a very dramatic television show, usually that is  on every day with the same group of characters.  In many countries, soap opera s only last a couple of months.  In the United States, soap operas can last  years and years; every day you’re seeing these characters over and over again.   Soap operas often have sort of crazy, weird stories, and when someone says , “this is like a soap opera,”

they mean that things are happening that aren’t nor mal, that seem rather unusual or odd.

Ray then says, “I suppose we shouldn’t speculate.”  “To speculate” (speculate) means to say what you think might be true even if y ou’re just guessing.  You don’t really know, you’re guessing what might be tr ue.  He says, “It’s sad when any marriage ends, even if it lasted only two month s.  Something must be really, really wrong.”  Courtney then says, “Or else…”  Ray  says, “Or else, what?” Courtney is saying there may be another reason, and  Ray is asking what do you mean.  What reason?  Courtney says, “Or else, Chris topher finally figured out (finally realized) what a witch Kate is.”  A “witch ” (witch), which is pronounced just like another word spelled different: (which) – a “w itch” is a very rude, negative way of describing a woman that you don’t like, usua lly because she’s mean or unpleasant.  Some people use another word – a vulga r word similar to “witch,” sounds like “witch” but starts with a “b” instead of a “w,” you should never, ever use that word in any circumstances I think, althoug h people do use it.  But a “witch” would be describing a woman who you don’t l ike, who you think is mean.

Ray says, “Oh, somebody’s a little catty today.”  “ To be catty” (catty) means that you are saying mean things about other people; you are gossiping about them; you are saying things about what they did in a crit ical way.  It’s sometimes used to describe a woman or a girl talking negatively ab out another woman or another girl, often somebody who they don’t like.  Ray says , “Do I detect some jealousy here?”  “To detect” (detect) means to observe somet hing that is otherwise difficult to see.  “I’m detecting some jealousy.”  “Jealousy”  is when you want something that someone else has, that you want what they have  and you’re mad at them because they have it and you don’t.  So in this cas e, Courtney might be jealous of Kate because Kate has something that she wants; she perhaps likes Christopher.

Courtney says, “Me?  Jealous of Kate?  Forget it!” meaning no way.  It’s an informal way of saying that you are completely in d isagreement with what the other person said, they’re completely wrong.  “Forg et it!  I’ve known Kate for years and I just wouldn’t wish her on my worst enem y!”  “To wish (someone or something) on your worst enemy” is a phrase used wh en you are talking about a person or a thing that you really don’t like, and y ou wouldn’t want anyone else to have to, for example, spend time with that person o r experience this certain thing.  Your “worst enemy” would be the person you hated the most.  So this other person is so bad or this other thing is so te rrible that you wouldn’t even want someone that you hate to have to be with that person or experience that thing.  “I wouldn’t wish her (Kate) on my worst ene my,” I wouldn’t want anyone to be with her because she’s such a terrible person, t hat’s what Courtney is saying.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Courtney:  Did you hear?  Kate and Christopher are trying to annul their marriage.

Ray:  What?!  They’ve only been married for two mon ths!  What brought this on?

Courtney:  I have no idea.  Neither of them is unde rage or bigamists and they married of their own free will, so I don’t know how  they can ask for an annulment.

# Describing Shapes and Sizes

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 766: Describing Shapes and Sizes.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 766.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about describing how big  something is, as well as the shape of that thing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carson:  Your apartment is going to look fabulous o nce I’m finished decorating it!

Brooke:  I really appreciate you taking the time to  help me choose some furniture, but I’d really like to keep the look conservative a nd traditional.

Carson:  Nonsense!  You have a fabulous new apartme nt and I’m going to help you make the most of it.  Look at that oval mirror.   It’ll look fantastic in your hall.

Brooke:  That mirror is gigantic!  I don’t think I want anything that size.  How about this rectangular one?

Carson:  That’s too puny for that space.  Oh, look at this triangular bookcase.  It would really complement the fireplace in the den.

Brooke:  I don’t think that bookcase is very functi onal.  The shelves are so narrow and it’s an odd shape.  It really looks nice, but I  need furniture that I can actually use.  I like this one better.

Carson:  How boring!  You need something that makes  a statement.  How about this chair?  It’s fabulous!

Brooke:  It’s a humongous circle on the floor with a cushion on top of it.  I don’t think anyone would ever sit on it.

Carson:  Yes, but in design, you have to consider f orm before function.

Brooke:  That’s where we differ.  I actually have t o live in this apartment, remember?

[end of dialogue]

Carson begins by saying to Brooke, “Your apartment is going to look fabulous (or wonderful) once I’m finished decorating it!”  “To d ecorate” (decorate) means to make something more attractive, especially a room i n a house.  People sometimes talk about “redecorating,” taking a room and changing it, decorating it again.  Putting different colors on the walls, mayb e different furniture, all this could be part of decorating a room.  You could also  decorate a tree, like a Christmas tree, by putting things on it, making it look pretty.

Brooke says, “I really appreciate you taking the ti me to help me choose (or select) some furniture, but I’d really like to keep  the look conservative and traditional.”  Brooke is saying that she wants the room to look traditional – traditional and conservative, she says.  Here it wo uld mean not something with bright or wild colors or crazy looking chairs.  She  wants something that is more like you would typically find in someone’s home, no thing too wild, nothing too crazy, something more conservative – safe.

Carson says, “Nonsense (meaning I don’t agree with you)!  You have a fabulous new apartment and I’m going to help you make the mo st of it.”  The expression “to make the most of (something)” means to do somet hing in order to get the most benefit, the maximum benefit from something.  “I’m going to London and I want to make the most of it.”  I’m going to the Bri tish Museum; I’m going to see all of the great historical sites; I’m going to hav e lunch with the Queen – well, probably not lunch with the Queen!  But, I’m going to make the most of it by doing as much as I can, that’s what Carson means he re.  He says to Brooke, “Look at that oval mirror.”  “Oval” (oval) is a sha pe; it’s like a circle, but a long circle.  It’s sort of the shape of an egg.  It’s ci rcular, it’s round, but it is a little longer, it’s not a perfect circle; that’s oval.  Ca rson and Brooke, I guess, are at some sort of store looking at things to buy for the  apartment.  Carson says that mirror “will look fantastic (wonderful) in your hal l.”  The “hall” is a place in a house usually to get from one place to another – from one  room to another you go through a hall, we sometimes call a “hallway.”  A h all might actually be a small room, especially when you first walk into a house; that’s probably what Carson is talking about here.  I’ll have to ask him!

Brooke says, “That mirror is gigantic!”  “Gigantic”  means very large; we might also say “enormous” or “huge.”  There’s a funny wor d that people have started using more recently, which is “ginormous.”  That’s not a real word in English.  It’s a combination of “gigantic” and “enormous” to mean really, really big.  Brooke says, “I don’t think I want anything that size (mea ning that big).  How about (or what do you think about) this rectangular one?”  “R ectangular” is in the shape of a rectangle, which is something that has 4 90 degre e angles in each corner, so it’s like a square.  A square is a rectangle, but a  rectangle could also be like a longer square, where the four sides are not equal.  In a square, all four sides are equal.  In a rectangle, you have two sides that are  equal, and then two other sides that are equal, but they don’t necessarily eq ual each other in length.  That’s a rectangle.

Carson says that the rectangular mirror is too puny  for that space.  “Puny” (puny) is the opposite of “gigantic,” it’s a way of descri bing the size of something that is very small.  It could also mean something that isn’ t very important or some person who isn’t very important.  But here, it just  means too small.  It’s too small for that space, meaning that area.  He says, “Oh, l ook at this triangular bookcase.”  A “bookcase” is a place where you put b ooks.  “Triangular” refers to the shape of a triangle; it has three straight side s on it.  There are lots of different kinds of triangles.  If you think of the Pythagorea n theorem, the notion that A squared plus B squared equals C squared, then you’l l understand a little bit about triangles, or at least remember a little bit of your geometry, that part of the study of math that looks at things like triangles.  Carson says, “It would really complement the fireplace in the den.”  He’s saying that this triangular bookcase would really complement the fireplace.  “To complem ent” (complement) means to look good next to something or to look good with so mething.  It can here also mean to match; it looks nice with something else be cause it has a similar color or a nice color that “goes with,” we might say, that o ther color.  “Complement” has the word “complete” in it, and that’s one way of re membering what it means.  It means that it goes with or completes something else .  There’s another word, “compliment,” sounds the same but has an “i” in the  middle (compliment), that’s when you say something nice to someone else about t heir shoes or their hair or how well they did on their geometry test.

Brooke says, “I don’t think that bookcase is very f unctional.”  “To be functional” means that you can actually use it for something; n ot just something that looks pretty – that looks nice, but you can have some pra ctical use from that particular object.  Brooke says, “The shelves are so narrow.”  To say something is “narrow” (narrow) means that it is very thin, it’s not very wide.  We sometimes talk about narrow streets, streets where it’s very difficult t o have two cars going in different directions because there isn’t enough room, that wo uld be narrow.  Well, this is a

narrow bookcase.  Brooke also says, “it’s an odd (o dd) shape.”  “Odd” here means unusual, strange, not common.  There are othe r meanings of the word “odd,” take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.  Brooke says that this bookcase that Carson likes really looks nice, but s he needs furniture that she can actually use.  “I like this one better.”  Carson do esn’t like the other one better.  He says, “How boring (how uninteresting)!  You need so mething that makes a statement.”  “To make a statement” here means to ex press yourself in some unusual way, especially when we’re talking about fa shion or design.  You’re doing something that other people will notice; they ’ll go, “Oh, wow!  That’s different.”  They may not like it, but they’ll pay attention to it; that’s making a statement.

Carson says, “How about (what do you think about) t his chair?  It’s fabulous!” Brooke says, “It’s a humongous circle on the floor. ”  “Humongous” (humongous) is a somewhat informal word meaning huge, large, en ormous, gigantic, ginormous, very big.  “A humongous circle” – a “cir cle,” you probably know, is a round shape like an “O,” that’s a circle.  Brooke s ays that this chair is a humongous circle on the floor on the floor with a c ushion on top of it.  A “cushion” (cushion) is another word for a pillow, something t hat you would sit on on a chair or on a sofa.  Brooke says, “I don’t think anyone w ould ever sit on (this chair).”

Carson says, “Yes, but in design (in the world of d esign and fashion), you have to consider form before function.”  “Form” is the way that something looks, the way that it is designed, how pretty it is for example.  “Function” is how useful or practical it is.  Brooke says, “That’s where we dif fer.”  “To differ” (differ) means to have a different or opposing opinion or view of som ething, or simply to be different from someone or something else, usually i n regards to your opinion or your viewpoint about something.  She says, “I actua lly have to live in this apartment, remember?”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carson:  Your apartment is going to look fabulous o nce I’m finished decorating it!

Brooke:  I really appreciate you taking the time to  help me choose some furniture, but I’d really like to keep the look conservative a nd traditional.

# Taking Care of Your Teeth

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 767: Taking Care of Your Teeth.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 767.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website – you know what it is – eslpod.com.  Go  there today and take look at our ESL Podcast Store, which has some additional co urses in English.  You can also check us out on Facebook at facebook.com/eslpo d.  Are you on Twitter? You can follow us @eslpod.

This episode has a dialogue between George and Mart ha about taking care of your teeth.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Martha:  Oh, I have a toothache!

George:  It sounds like you’re in for a visit to the dentist.

Martha:  That would be the last resort.  I hate going to the dentist.  I don’t like needles and the sound of the drill scares me to dea th.  I’m hoping the toothache will just go away.

George:  You really should get that checked out.  D o you want me to make an appointment for you with my dentist?

Martha:  No, thanks.  I haven’t seen a dentist in y ears and I don’t plan to now unless I have no choice.

George:  Years?!  You haven’t been to a dentist in years?  Haven’t you ever heard of preventive care?  You’re supposed to get a  dental cleaning twice a year.

Martha:  I don’t follow doctor and dentist guidelin es like that.  I brush my teeth every day.  That’s good enough.

George:  No, it’s not.  You should be flossing ever y day and rinsing your mouth with mouthwash to keep your teeth and gums healthy.   If you haven’t been to the dentist in years, I’m not surprised you didn’t know  that.

 Martha:  Stop preaching!  I’ll go to the dentist wh en I need to.

George:  Like now.

Martha:  Maybe.  It doesn’t hurt that much anymore…

George:  I never knew you were such a chicken.

Martha:  [makes a chicken noise] Bwauk, bwauk…!

[end of dialogue]

Martha begins our dialogue by saying, “Oh, I have a  toothache!”  A “toothache” (toothache – one word) is when you have a pain in y our tooth.  Your “teeth,” which is the plural of “tooth,” are, of course, the se white things inside your mouth that you use to eat.  Martha has a toothache.  You can have a toothache, you can have a headache, you can have a stomachache, de pending on what part of your body hurts.

George says, “It sounds like (it seems to me) you’r e in for a visit to the dentist.” “To be in for (something)” means you’re going to ha ve to do something very soon.  Often we use that expression when we’re talk ing about something that isn’t very nice, something isn’t very pleasant.  We  might even say, “You’re in for a big surprise.”  That usually means you don’t unders tand something bad that is going to happen to you.  A “dentist” (dentist) is a  person who works on – a doctor who works on your teeth, a medical doctor who takes  care of or specializes in taking care of teeth.

Martha says going to the doctor would be the last r esort.  The expression “the last resort” (resort) means it’s the last option yo u will choose, only after you do everything else, it’s the one that you don’t want to do and will only do because nothing else works.  Perhaps it’s very expensive, p erhaps it’s just very unpleasant or even embarrassing.  Martha says, “I h ate going to the dentist.  I don’t like needles.”  “Needles” are sharp objects t hey stick into your body to put drugs into them, usually.  Martha doesn’t like the sound of the drill; she says, “the sound of the drill scares me to death,” makes me ve ry frightened.  A “drill” (drill) here refers to a machine that makes holes in someth ing.  You can use a drill to make a hole in your wall if you are putting somethi ng on your wall.  Well, dentists use drills to make holes in your teeth in order to repair them.  “Drill” actually has a couple of different meanings; those can be found in  – where else? – our Learning

Guide.  Martha says, “I’m hoping the toothache will  just go away,” meaning it will disappear, I will no longer have it.

George says, “You really should get that checked ou t.”  When someone says you need to have something “checked out” they mean exam ined or reviewed, especially by someone who’s an expert in that area:  “My foot is hurting me.” “You should really a podiatrist (a foot doctor) che ck that out.”  “To check out” has some other meanings in English; you can say, “I’m g oing to check out that movie.”  That means I’m going to watch it or I’m go ing to read about it or investigate it.  Or, “Check out this guy walking do wn the street.”  There it means simply look at this guy.  There’s actually, uh, eve n more meanings of this two- word phrasal verb, “to check out.”  You can use it to refer to taking a book out of the library: “I’m going to check out a book.”  But here, it refers having someone who’s an expert examine or look at something.  Geor ge says, “Do you want me to make an appointment for you with my dentist?”  A n “appointment” is a particular day and time that you are going to see s omeone.  It’s like a date, but when we talk about business things or going to a do ctor or dentist, having an appointment is the time and day you are going to se e that person.

Martha says, “No, thanks.  I haven’t seen a dentist  in years and I don’t plan to now unless I have no choice.”  She hasn’t gone to t he dentist in many years, and she isn’t going to go unless she has to, unless she  has no other option or choice. George is surprised; he says, “Years?!”  He’s surpr ised that Martha hasn’t been to a dentist in years.  “You haven’t been to a dent ist in years?  Haven’t you ever heard of preventive care?”  “To prevent” (prevent) means to make sure something does not happen.  “Preventive,” then, is an adjective.  “Care,” here, is like a medical treatment or some action that you do  so that you are healthy. “Preventative care” are things that you do so that you don’t get sick.  So, you should wash your hands with soap and water after us ing the bathroom, and before eating with your hands to prevent you from g etting sick later.  That’s preventative care.

Martha apparently, we guess, doesn’t believe in pre ventative care.  George says, “You’re supposed to get a dental cleaning twice a y ear.”  The word “dental” refers to your teeth.  “Dental cleaning,” then, is a proce ss where you go and have your teeth cleaned usually by someone who works with the  dentist, not actually the dentist.  Usually the person who cleans your teeth is called a “dental hygienist.” This is sort of like the dentist’s assistant that c leans your teeth and makes sure that you don’t have any problems with your teeth.

Martha says, “I don’t follow doctor and dentist gui delines like that.”  I don’t follow the rules that doctors and dentists give me, she’s saying.  “I brush my teeth every

day.  That’s good enough.”  That’s sufficient.  “To  brush (brush) your teeth” means to take a small, little tool, really, that yo u put something on called “toothpaste.”  The tool is called a “brush” or a “t oothbrush” and you put it in your mouth and you move it back and forth to clean your teeth.  Or, you get one of those machines, where it moves for you.  I like tho se; I have one of those.  I forget what they’re called…Sonicare or something li ke that.

Anyway, Martha says she brushes her teeth every day  and that should be enough.  George says, “No, it’s not.”  It’s not suf ficient; it’s not enough; it’s not good enough.  “You should be flossing every day.”  “To floss” (floss) is to take a small piece of string and put it in between each of  your teeth to remove any food that is stuck there – that is still there, because if it stays there it could eventually cause what is called a “cavity” (cavity).  A “cavit y” is like a hole in your tooth that the dentist then has to fill or fix.  George says t hat Martha should be flossing every day and rinsing her mouth.  “To rinse” (rinse ) means to put some liquid in your mouth, like something like water, and move the  liquid back and forth, and then usually you spit the liquid out again.  The sp ecific liquid you would use here would be mouthwash.  “Mouthwash” is a special kind of liquid that is supposed to help keep your teeth healthy.  He says that if you rinse your mouth with mouthwash it will keep your teeth and gums healthy.   “Gums” (gums) is what your teeth are stuck into in your mouth.  It’s the area of the skin on the inside of your mouth that holds your teeth in your mouth.  “G um” has a couple of different meanings in English however; take a look at the Lea rning Guide for some more of those.

George says, “If you haven’t been to a dentist in y ears, I’m not surprised you didn’t know that.”  Martha says to George, “Stop pr eaching!”  “To preach” (preach) in this context means to give someone else  advice that they don’t want, usually in such a way that you are bothering them o r you are acting as if you were better than them.  “To preach” can also be a v erb used in a religious sense, something that a minister or a rabbi or a priest mi ght do.  But here, it means to give advice that someone doesn’t want.  Martha says , “Stop preaching!  I’ll go to the dentist when I need to.”  George says, “Like no w,” meaning you need to go now.  Martha says, “Maybe.  It doesn’t hurt that mu ch anymore…”  George said, “I never knew you were such a chicken.”  A “chicken ” is an animal that you can eat.  But, “chicken” here is used to describe someo ne who is scared of doing something, who is afraid, someone who is what we wo uld call a “coward” (coward), someone who is not brave.  George says, “ I never knew you were such a chicken,” that you were so afraid.  Martha makes a chicken noise that we would make in English, “Bwauk, bwauk, bwauk!”  She’s sayi ng, of course, that yes, she is a chicken.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Martha:  Oh, I have a toothache!

George:  It sounds like you’re in for a visit to the dentist.

Martha:  That would be the last resort.  I hate going to the dentist.  I don’t like needles and the sound of the drill scares me to dea th.  I’m hoping the toothache will just go away.

George:  You really should get that checked out.  D o you want me to make an appointment for you with my dentist?

Martha:  No, thanks.  I haven’t seen a dentist in y ears and I don’t plan to now unless I have no choice.

George:  Years?!  You haven’t been to a dentist in years?  Haven’t you ever heard of preventive care?  You’re supposed to get a  dental cleaning twice a year.

Martha:  I don’t follow doctor and dentist guidelin es like that.  I brush my teeth every day.  That’s good enough.

George:  No, it’s not.  You should be flossing ever y day and rinsing your mouth with mouthwash to keep your teeth and gums healthy.   If you haven’t been to the dentist in years, I’m not surprised you didn’t know  that.

Martha:  Stop preaching!  I’ll go to the dentist wh en I need to.

George:  Like now.

Martha:  Maybe.  It doesn’t hurt that much anymore…

George:  I never knew you were such a chicken.

Martha:  [makes a chicken noise] Bwauk, bwauk…!

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 768.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles in the State of California in  the country of the United States – but you know that already!

This episode is a dialogue between Justin and Rache l about trying to get the best price for something that you’re going to buy.  Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Justin:  Hello.

Rachel:  Hi, Justin.  It’s Rachel from McQ Corp.

Justin:  Oh hi, Rachel.  Did you get our bid for the job?

Rachel:  Yes, we did.  We like your proposal, but w e still need to come to terms on the price.

Justin:  We’ve already given you our rock-bottom pr ice because we want to get this job, but we always try to be flexible.

Rachel:  Good.  Could you do better on what you’ve quoted us for labor?  The price seemed a little high.

Justin:  We might be able to trim a little off of t hat.  How about if we discount that by 10 percent?

Rachel:  That’s an attractive offer, but we were ho ping for 20 percent.

Justin:  You’re driving a hard bargain.  We have ce rtain fixed costs, you know.

Rachel:  I do and that’s why I’m only asking about labor costs.  Can you meet me halfway at 15 percent?

 Justin:  I think that might be doable, if that’s the only stumbling block to us getting the job.

Rachel:  I can’t make any promises, but I’ll do my best.

Justin:  That’s all I can ask.  I’ll send you over a revised bid.

Rachel:  Great.  I hope to have good news for you n ext week.

[end of dialogue]

We begin our phone conversation with Justin saying,  “Hello.”  Rachel says, “Hi, Justin.  It’s Rachel from McQ Corp.”  “Oh hi, Rache l,” Justin says, “Did you get our bid for the job?”  To understand “bid” (bid) yo u have to think of a company or an individual person who wants to get something don e, or perhaps wants to purchase something – buy something.  A company may ask other companies, “How much will you charge me?”  How much will it co st me to do this, to build a new building or to paint my offices or whatever it happens to be?  These different companies will then give you a proposal that includ es a price: “Well, we will charge you 25 dollars,” or, “25,000 dollars,” whate ver it is.  That proposal, with a price, is called a “bid.”  So, a “bid” is something  that I give to another company, telling them how much I will charge them to do what ever they want to have done. “Bid” actually has a few other meanings in English,  as well, and those can be found – where else? – in the Learning Guide.

Rachel said, “Yes, we did (receive your bid).”  She  says, “We like your proposal (what you are suggesting or proposing to do), but w e still need to come to terms on the price.”  “To come to terms” (terms) means to  reach an agreement or an understanding, to agree on something.  Justin says,  “We’ve already given you our rock-bottom price.”  The expression “rock-botto m” means as low as possible; usually we’re talking about a price for something.  What Justin is saying here is that the price that they gave Rachel and McQ Corp. is the lowest possible price they can give them; they can’t give them any more d iscount, it’s the rock-bottom price.  Sometimes people use “rock-bottom” as a nou n, especially with the verb “hit.”  “I’ve hit rock-bottom” means I’ve gone as l ow as I can go, especially if you are having difficulties or you have some sort of pr oblem.  Usually it’s a negative thing to hit rock-bottom.  Justin says, “We’ve alre ady given you our rock-bottom price because we want to get this job (meaning we want you hire us), but we always try to be flexible.”  “To be flexible” (flex ible) means to be willing to change, to be willing to do something different; in this ca se, perhaps, to be willing to lower the price.

 Rachel says, “Good.  Could you do better on what yo u’ve quoted us for labor?” “To do better on” means to improve in some way.  What Rachel is asking for is a lower price on what Justin has quoted them for labo r.  “To quote” means to give a price, usually in writing.  A “quote” is similar to  a “bid.”  Here it’s used as a verb to mean to give someone a price – a definite price wri tten down, here’s how much I’m going to charge you.  “Labor” is the amount of money you pay people to work. So if you are painting your house, labor would be t he amount of money you have to pay the painters, the people who actually put the paint on your house.  The other part of the cost would be the supplies, the t hings they actually use; in this case, the cans of paint that they have to buy.  Rac hel says, “The price (the price for labor) seemed a little high.”  Rachel’s company  thought it was too high.

Justin says, “We might be able to trim a little off  of that.”  “To trim” (trim) means to reduce the amount of something or make something a little bit smaller; to trim your hair would be to cut a little bit of your hair  off of your head.  “Trim” has a few other meanings, which can be found, once again, in our Learning Guide.  Justin says, “We might be able to trim a little off of tha t (to lower the price).  How about (what do you think) if we discount that by 10 perce nt?”  “To discount,” as a verb, means to lower or reduce the price of something.

Rachel says, “That’s an attractive offer, but we we re hoping for 20 percent.” “Attractive” here means appealing, something that m akes you want to accept it, something that sounds or looks good to you.  “Attra ctive,” when used to describe a person, would mean someone who’s very good lookin g: a handsome man, a beautiful woman.  Rachel says that the offer – the proposal that Justin gave of a 10 percent discount is attractive, it’s nice, but h er company was hoping for 20 percent, a 20 percent discount on the price of labo r.

Justin says, “You’re driving a hard bargain.”  The expression “to drive a hard bargain” (bargain) means to be a difficult, we migh t say a “tough” negotiator.  A “negotiator” is someone who negotiates a price.  “T o negotiate” means to go back and forth with someone to get the best price y ou possibly can – the lowest price you possibly can, and that’s what Rachel is d oing; she’s negotiating the price.  She’s saying, “Well, we’d like it a little lower,” and Justin is saying, “Well, we can’t go that low.  How about this?” and they go  back and forth, each one of them saying something, and eventually they will agr ee on a price.  But if you make it very difficult for the other person to agre e with you, if you ask for a lot of things or want a very low price, we might say that you drive a hard bargain; you are very difficult to negotiate with.

Justin says, “We have certain fixed costs, you know .”  A “fixed cost” is a kind of expense that you have to pay for, no matter how muc h business you have.  So if you have an office in a building, you have to pay r ent every month.  It doesn’t matter how much business you are doing – how much y ou are selling, the person who owns the building wants his or her money for the rent.  So that’s what we would call a “fixed cost.”  It doesn’t go up or dow n, typically, depending upon the amount of things or services that you sell.

Rachel says, “I do (meaning I understand you have c ertain fixed costs) and that’s why I’m only asking about labor costs.”  Then she s ays, “Can you meet me halfway at 15 percent?”  When you say, “can you mee t me halfway” (halfway – one word), you mean can we compromise, can we divid e it in half.  Can we – another expression – split the difference?  You wan t 25 percent, I want 15 percent; we agree on 20 percent, it’s halfway betwe en 15 and 25.  So, the expression is “Can you meet me halfway?”

Justin says, “I think that might be doable.”  “Doab le” means you are able to do it, it’s possible.  He says it “might be doable, if tha t’s the only stumbling block to us getting the job.”  A “stumbling (stumbling) block ( block)” is something that makes it difficult but not impossible for you to get what  you want, to reach your goal.  In this case, Justin wants to get the contract from Ra chel’s company.  He wants to be able to sell his services to her company.  A “st umbling block” would be something that gets in the way, some difficulty.  H e’s saying that if the labor cost is the only stumbling block he might be able to com promise – to meet her halfway – by reducing the labor cost by 15 percent.

Rachel says, “I can’t make any promises, but I’ll d o my best.”  Justin is asking her if there’s going to be anything else she wants to a sk for, and she’s saying that she can’t make any promises.  She can’t say yes def initely, but she’ll do her best; she’ll try to make sure that this is the only thing  she asks for.  Justin says, “That’s all I can ask,” meaning that’s all I want you to do , to do your best.  He says, “I’ll send you over (I’ll send you) a revised bid.”  “Rev ised” means corrected, updated, changed.  Rachel says, “Great.  I hope to have good news for you next week,” meaning I hope I will be able to tell you th at you – your company – got the job; we are going to hire you next week.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Justin:  Hello.

Rachel:  Hi, Justin.  It’s Rachel from McQ Corp.

Justin:  Oh hi, Rachel.  Did you get our bid for the job?

Rachel:  Yes, we did.  We like your proposal, but w e still need to come to terms on the price.

Justin:  We’ve already given you our rock-bottom pr ice because we want to get this job, but we always try to be flexible.

Rachel:  Good.  Could you do better on what you’ve quoted us for labor?  The price seemed a little high.

# Trying Unusual Foods

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 769: Trying Unusual Foods.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 769.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

If you like listening to ESL Podcast, consider beco ming a member by going to eslpod.com.

This episode is a dialogue between Antonio and Cand ace.  We’re going to be talking about eating strange, different, unusual fo od.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Antonio:  What is that smell?!  It stinks!

Candace:  This is a dish my roommate taught me to m ake.  It’s really good. Want a bite?

Antonio:  You’ve got to be kidding me!  You actuall y eat that?  You can stomach something that smells that foul?

Candace:  Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it.  I admit that it’s an acquired taste, but once you develop a taste for it, you’ll not onl y like it, you’ll crave it like I do.

Antonio:  I would never crave something that unappe tizing.  You’ve gone over the edge.  I’ve always known you were weird, but this t akes the cake.

Candace:  You need to open your mind to new culinar y experiences.  You need to wake up your taste buds.  Your palate will thank  you for it.  If you try it, you might like it.

Antonio:  If I try it, I may puke!

[end of dialogue]

Antonio begins by saying, “What is that smell?!  It  stinks!”  “To stink” (stink) means to smell very bad, to have a very unpleasant odor or smell.  Candace says, “This is a dish my roommate taught me to make .”  Your “roommate” is a

person that you usually share an apartment with or a house with.  Candace says that the food – the dish that Antonio smells was so mething her roommate had taught her to cook.  She says, “It’s really good.  Want a bite?”  A “bite” (bite) is a small piece of food, a small bit of food that you g ive someone just to taste something.  So she says, “Want a bite?”

Antonio says, “You’ve got to be kidding me (meaning  you’re joking, right)!  You actually eat that?”  He can’t believe that Candace is eating whatever this food is. He says, “You can stomach something that smells tha t foul?”  “To stomach” (stomach) is to be able to eat something, something  that is very perhaps unpleasant; it smells bad or it tastes bad.  “To st omach it” means to be able to eat it without getting sick.  Antonio asks Candace if she can stomach something that smells that bad – that foul (foul).  “Foul” ha s another meaning in English, as does the word “bite.”  Both of those can be found i n our Learning Guide.

Candace says, “Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it .”  This is an old expression. “Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it” means to ask  someone to keep an open mind, not to say no to something just because it’s differ ent or weird.  First, you should try doing it yourself, and then you can decide whet her you want to criticize it.  “To knock (something)” here means to criticize it.  So don’t criticize it – don’t knock it until you’ve yourself actually tried it yourself.  Candace says, “I admit that it’s an acquired taste.”  The expression “an acquired taste ” means something that perhaps you don’t like the first time you try it, b ut eventually – after a while – you learn to like something.  This happens a lot, I thi nk, with food, when you try new food.  Maybe at first you don’t like it, but eventu ally you learn to like it more and more.  Well that’s what Candace is saying about the  food she’s eating.  She says, “once you develop a taste for it, you’ll not only like it, you’ll crave it like I do.”  “To develop a taste for (something)” means to  gradually begin to like it; slowly, after each time you eat it, you like it mor e and more.  You develop a taste for it.  Once you do that, she says, you’ll crave t his food like I do.  “To crave” (crave) means to have a very strong desire for some thing.  We use this especially when talking about food: “I crave a piec e of apple pie.”  I really want a piece of apple pie.  The noun is “craving.”  We say , “I have a craving for (something).”  “I have a craving for apple pie.”

But Antonio doesn’t think he will like this food.  He says, “I would never crave something that unappetizing.”  Something that is “a ppetizing” makes you want to eat it; it looks good, it smells good.  The opposit e would be “unappetizing.” Antonio says that he would never crave something th at unappetizing or so unappetizing.  He says to Candace, “You’ve gone ove r the edge.”  “To go over the edge” (edge) here means to go crazy, or do too much of something, to take an idea to the extreme point.  For example, you may  like to gamble and you

decide you’re going to go Las Vegas – a famous plac e for gambling in the United States – and you’re going to bet your entire house.   You’re going to say, “I want to bet my house in a poker game.”  Well, that’s going over the edge, that’s going too far; you don’t want to lose your house in a pok er game.  Antonio thinks that Candace has gone over the edge by eating this weird , unusual food.  He says, “I’ve always known you were weird, but this takes t he cake.”  The expression “to take the cake” means to be the most unbelievable or  crazy example of something.  You may have a friend that likes to wea r strange clothing, and one day he decides to go work wearing his swimming trun ks, nothing but the clothes he would wear to go swimming.  You might say, “Well , that really takes the cake.” That’s the most bizarre, extreme example of this pe rson’s weird behavior.

Candace says, however, “You (Antonio) need to open your mind to new culinary experiences.”  “To open your mind” means to be will ing to consider or think about all possibilities, all different options without sa ying no right away.  You’re going to think about many different possibilities, that’s to  have or to keep an open mind. Candace says Antonio needs to open his mind – which  is the same as to keep an open mind – to new culinary experiences.  “Culinary ” (culinary) is anything related to cooking food.  Candace says Antonio need s to wake up his taste buds. Your “taste buds” (buds) are small, little things o n your tongue that are used for tasting; it’s how you are able to taste something o n your tongue, through these little dots called “taste buds” in English.  Candac e says that Antonio needs to wake up his taste buds, meaning he needs to do some thing different, as if they were now sleeping.  She says, “Your palate will tha nk you for it.”  Your “palate” (palate) here means your sense of taste; your abili ty to enjoy different tastes, different flavors of food.  Candace says, “Your pal ate will thank you for it,” meaning if you decide to try different foods you wi ll like it, you like the taste.  She says, “If you try it, you might like it.”

Antonio says, “If I try it, I may puke!”  “Puke” (p uke) is an informal word for vomit, to throw up.  When the contents of your stomach com e out through your mouth, that’s to vomit, to throw up.  A little more inform al way of saying that would be “to puke,” and that’s what Antonio says will happen to him if he tries some of this unusual food that Candace likes to eat.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Antonio:  What is that smell?!  It stinks!

Candace:  This is a dish my roommate taught me to m ake.  It’s really good. Want a bite?

Antonio:  You’ve got to be kidding me!  You actuall y eat that?  You can stomach something that smells that foul?

Candace:  Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it.  I admit that it’s an acquired taste, but once you develop a taste for it, you’ll not onl y like it, you’ll crave it like I do.

Antonio:  I would never crave something that unappe tizing.  You’ve gone over the edge.  I’ve always known you were weird, but this t akes the cake.

Candace:  You need to open your mind to new culinar y experiences.  You need to wake up your taste buds.  Your palate will thank  you for it.  If you try it, you might like it.

Antonio:  If I try it, I may puke!

# Joining a Tour

This episode is called “Joining a Tour.”  We’re going to be taking a trip – a vacation, and we’re going to be going with a group of other people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Darrel:  What are you looking at?

Alice:  Tours for our vacation.  I was thinking tha t it’d be hard for us to get around on our own, so I think joining a tour is a good ide a.

Darrel:  Really?  I thought we’d make our way aroun d leisurely to see the sites.  I don’t like the fast pace of tours.  I’d rather have  the time to take in each site, not rush through it just to say I’ve been there.

Alice:  Tours come in all shapes and sizes.  I’m su re we can find one that isn’t too fast-paced or strenuous for you.

Darrel:  And I don’t want to eat all my meals with the tour group.  I want some time to explore on our own.

Alice:  All right, I’m looking at a tour that has t he perfect itinerary.  It’s also gotten rave reviews.  It includes a tour guide, all admiss ion fees, accommodations, ground transportation, and most of the meals.  And there are several free mornings and afternoons built-in so we can explore on our own.

Darrel:  I don’t know.

Alice:  The alternative is for you to plan each sto p of our trip.

Darrel:  A tour is sounding better and better.

[end of dialogue]

Darrel begins by saying to Alice, “What are you loo king at?”  Alice says, “Tours for our vacation.”  A “tour” (tour) is an organized  journey to see a city or a place, usually it’s with a group of people, and there is s omeone leading the tour called the “tour guide.”  Alice is looking for tours for h er and Darrel’s vacation.  She says, “I was thinking that it’d be hard for us to g et around on our own,” meaning it would be difficult for us to go to this place, wher ever they’re going, by themselves, “so I think joining a tour is a good id ea,” signing up, paying and becoming a member of this group that will travel to gether.

Darrel says, “Really?  I thought we’d make our way around leisurely to see the sites.”  “To make our way around” means to go by yo urself, not with another group, to find out the interesting things, to look at things by yourself; you don’t have anyone helping you.  “Leisurely” (leisurely) i s an adverb meaning slowly, in a very calm and relaxed, enjoyable way.  The “sites ” (sites) are places that you go to visit: it could be a famous building, it coul d be a beautiful park, it might to be a museum, anything that you would go as a tourist –  as someone visiting another place – to see.  That would be called a “site.”  Da rrel says he doesn’t like the fast pace of tours.  The “pace” (pace) is the speed, how  fast or how slow something goes.  I can talk at a fast pace or I can talk at a  slow pace.  I can walk at a fast pace or walk at a slow pace.  Darrel says, “I’d rat her have the time to take in each site, not rush through it just to say I’ve bee n there.”  “To take in” means to look at, to experience, to appreciate something.  I f you come to Los Angeles I would tell you to go and drive up along the ocean a nd take in the beautiful views – the beautiful scenery, the things that you can se e: the ocean and so forth.  Well Darrel says he wants time to take in each site – ea ch place they visit, not rush through it just to say he’s been there.  “To rush t hrough (something)” is to do something very quickly, usually without enough time  to do it well.  He doesn’t want to go from one place to another place just to say that he was at those places, he wants to actually stop and enjoy them.

Alice says, “Tours come in all shapes and sizes.”  The expression “to come in all shapes and sizes” means that there is a wide variet y of options, a lot of different types, a lot of different ways that tours can be or ganized; they’re not all the same. Alice says, “I’m sure we can find one that isn’t (t hat is not) too fast-paced or strenuous for you.”  When we say is something is “s trenuous” (strenuous) we mean it’s difficult, it requires a lot of perhaps p hysical work or mental concentration.  It’s a lot of work.  Usually it’s u sed when we talk about physical

work, like lifting heavy boxes for example.  Alice thinks she can find a tour that isn’t too strenuous for Darrel.

Darrel says, “And I don’t want to eat all my meals with the tour group.”  Your “meals” are your breakfast, your lunch, and your di nner.  It’s often the case that on a tour you go to a restaurant and everyone eats together.  Darrel doesn’t want to do that; he says, “I want some time to explore o n our own.”  “To explore” means to go to someplace you’ve never been before t o try to learn new things, to discover new things.  Darrel says he wants to explo re.  Alice says, “All right, I’m looking at a tour that has the perfect itinerary.”  “Itinerary” is a planned scheduled for a trip.  It shows exactly what you are going to  be doing: first you get up at 8:00, then you eat breakfast, your bus leaves at 11 :00, you arrive at the museum at 1:00, and so on.  That’s an itinerary.  Alice sa ys this tour has gotten, or has received, rave reviews.  “Rave reviews” are when pe ople say that something is very wonderful; it’s excellent.  You may, for examp le, be thinking of going to a restaurant, so you go online and you look at the re views, what other people say about that restaurant.  If they are saying they’re wonderful, then we say they are “rave (rave) reviews.”  “Rave” has a couple of diff erent meanings in English, however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some  of those.

Alice says that this tour she found includes a tour  guide (remember that’s the person who is the leader of the tour), all admissio n fees, accommodations, ground transportation, and most of our meals.  An “ admission fee” is the amount of money that you pay to get into a museum or to ge t into some famous historical site.  The word “fee” (fee) is price.  “Admission” is to get into something, to enter into something, or to become part of something.  “A ccommodations” is another word for the place where you are going to sleep at night; we sometimes called this “lodging” (lodging).  “Lodging” and “accommoda tions” mean the same thing, it’s your hotel or whatever place you are staying a t and sleeping at.  “Ground transportation” refers to how you get from one plac e to another by car, bus, train, subway, anything that travels on the ground.  It do es not include air travel; we’re not talking about airplanes.  But, we’re talking ab out all the other ways that you can travel without leaving the ground.

Alice says, “there are several free mornings,” mean ing mornings that you don’t have anything planned, that you can do what you wan t, “and afternoons.”  These free mornings and afternoons are built-in so they can explore on their own. When we say something is “built-in” we mean it’s in cluded as part of the plan – as part of the itinerary.  “We are planning that on  the second day in the afternoon we won’t have any activities, you can do whatever y ou want.”  That’s why Alice says they are built-in; they are part of the plan.

Darrel is not sure; he says, “I don’t know.”  Alice  says, “The alternative is for you to plan each stop of our trip.”  The “alternative” means the other option or another way we can do this.  She says the alternative is for Darrel to plan each stop – each day, each thing you do each day – for their tr ip.  Darrel says, “A tour is sounding better and better.”  Now that he has the o ption of doing everything himself or taking a tour, now he’s more interested in taking the tour!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal pace.

[start of dialogue]

Darrel:  What are you looking at?

Alice:  Tours for our vacation.  I was thinking tha t it’d be hard for us to get around on our own, so I think joining a tour is a good ide a.

Darrel:  Really?  I thought we’d make our way aroun d leisurely to see the sites.  I don’t like the fast pace of tours.  I’d rather have  the time to take in each site, not rush through it just to say I’ve been there.

Alice:  Tours come in all shapes and sizes.  I’m su re we can find one that isn’t too fast-paced or strenuous for you.

Darrel:  And I don’t want to eat all my meals with the tour group.  I want some time to explore on our own.

Alice:  All right, I’m looking at a tour that has t he perfect itinerary.  It’s also gotten rave reviews.  It includes a tour guide, all admiss ion fees, accommodations, ground transportation, and most of the meals.  And there are several free mornings and afternoons built-in so we can explore on our own.

Darrel:  I don’t know.

Alice:  The alternative is for you to plan each sto p of our trip.

Darrel:  A tour is sounding better and better.

# Commuting by Train

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 771: Commuting by Train.

This episode is a dialogue between Lisa and Omar ta lking about traveling on a train.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lisa:  Can you tell me if this is the right platfor m for the train to Arlington?

Omar:  Yes, it is.  Is this your first time taking the train?

Lisa:  Is it that obvious?

Omar:  No, you just look a little lost.

Lisa:  I’m starting a new job and I have to commute  to work for the first time.

Omar:  Oh, I see.  Did you buy a ticket at the tick et machine?

Lisa:  Yes, I did, when I entered the station.  I h ope I bought the right one.

Omar:  Let me see.  Yes, that’s the right one.  The  good news is that I haven’t heard any announcements about the train being delay ed, like it has been a couple of times this week, so it should be on time.

Lisa:  I’m relieved to hear that.  I can’t afford t o be late to work on my first day. Will I need to show this ticket to get on the train ?

Omar:  Not when you get on.  After the train is und er way, the conductor will walk down the aisle to collect it.

Lisa:  Oh, I see, thanks.  That sounds simple.

Omar:  It is simple if you can actually find a seat .  It can be pretty crowded on these commuter trains.  Sometimes it’s standing roo m only.

Lisa:  Let’s hope for the best.

Omar:  Stick with me.  I’ll elbow a few people out of the way to get you a seat.

Lisa:  [laughs]  Thanks, I think.

[end of dialogue]

Lisa begins by asking Omar, “Can you tell me if thi s is the right platform for the train to Arlington?”  A “platform” (platform) is a large, flat area where people stand waiting for a train or a subway train.  A tra in, you probably know, has several small sections called “cars,” but they’re n ot cars like you drive down the street.  They are cars that are connected to each o ther and all move in one direction down something called a “track” (track).

Well, Lisa wants to know if this is the right platf orm, the right place to get the train to Arlington.  Omar says, “Yes, it is.  Is this you r first time taking the train?”  Lisa says, “Is it that obvious?”  Something that is “obv ious” is something that is easily seen; you have no difficulty understanding it.  Wha t she’s saying here is do I really seem like that much of a beginner, obviously  it is the first time she has taken the train.  Omar says, “No, you just look a l ittle lost,” a little confused, like you don’t know where to go.

Lisa says, “I’m starting a new job and I have to co mmute to work for the first time.”  “To commute” (commute) means to travel usua lly from your home to where you work and back again.  Some people commute  by car, some people commute by subway; some people commute, if it’s a v ery long distance, by train. Lisa is commuting by train.

Omar says, “Oh, I see.  Did you buy a ticket at the  ticket machine?”  The “ticket machine” is the machine that gives you usually a li ttle piece of paper called a “ticket” that allows you to be on the train.  Lisa says, “Yes, I did, when I entered the station.”  The “station” is the area where the trains all come and stop, and that’s where you get on and off the train, at the t rain station.  You can also have a bus station.  Lisa says, “I hope I bought the right  one,” meaning I hope I purchased the correct ticket.

Omar says, “Let me see.  Yes, that’s the right one.   The good news is that I haven’t heard any announcements about the train bei ng delayed.  An “announcement” is information, in this case that wo uld be said over the large speakers in the train station on the platform.  If a train is going to be late they sometimes tell everyone – they announce it, and the  noun is an “announcement.” “To be delayed” means that it isn’t going to arrive  or leave when it’s supposed to; it’s late.  Sometimes trains are delayed; they don’ t arrive or leave when they are supposed to.  Omar says that the train has been del ayed a couple of times this week, but because there were no announcements it sh ould be on time.  When we say something is “on time” we mean it should lea ve at the correct or scheduled time, or arrive at the correct or schedul ed time.

Lisa says, “I’m relieved to hear that (I’m happy to  hear that).  I can’t afford to be late to work on my first day.”  “I can’t afford” me ans that it’s not possible for me, otherwise it will be very bad for me.  “Will I need  to show this ticket to get on the train?”  Omar says, “Not when you get on.  After the train is under way, the conductor will walk down the aisle to collect it.”  “After the train is under way” means after the train has already started to move –  has left the station.  Then, the “conductor,” the person who works for the train  company whose job it is to collect the tickets, he will walk – or she – will w alk down the aisle.  The “aisle” is the narrow area between the seats for walking, wher e you can move up and down the train.  The conductor will then “collect” the tickets, he will take them from you.  Sometimes he will put mark on them and t hen give them back to you, depending on the train.

Lisa says, “Oh, I see, thanks.  That sounds simple. ”  Omar says, “It is simple if you can actually find a seat.  It can be pretty (or  very) crowded on these commuter trains,” these trains that take people bac k and forth from work.  “To be crowded” means you don’t have a lot of room to move .  Omar says, “Sometimes it’s standing room only.”  “Standing room only” mea ns that all of the seats are filled.  There’s no place to sit down, you have to stand.  This, of course, is very common in a subway system in a large city, but some times it can happen on trains as well.

Lisa says, “Let’s hope for the best,” meaning let’s  be optimistic; let’s hope that we get a seat, in this case.  Omar says, “Stick with m e.”  “To stick with (someone)” means to stay very close to that person or to liste n to everything they say, especially when you are traveling somewhere or goin g somewhere.  Omar says, jokingly we think, “I’ll elbow a few people out of the way to get you a seat.”  “To elbow” (elbow), as a verb, means to push someone ou t of the way with your elbow.  Your “elbow” is the point in your arm that connects the forearm, that has your hand on the end of it, and I guess we’d call t he upper part of your arm; that’s

the “elbow.  But as a verb “to elbow” would mean to  use that part of your body to push people away.  Omar is saying he’s going to elb ow a few people out of the way so that Lisa can have a seat.  We suspect here that Omar maybe is interested in Lisa, trying to be friendly with her.   Lisa laughs and says, “Thanks, I think.”  When someone says “I think” at the end, th at means they’re not really sure; they’re not sure if they should thank this pe rson for what they just said.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lisa:  Can you tell me if this is the right platfor m for the train to Arlington?

Omar:  Yes, it is.  Is this your first time taking the train?

Lisa:  Is it that obvious?

Omar:  No, you just look a little lost.

Lisa:  I’m starting a new job and I have to commute  to work for the first time.

Omar:  Oh, I see.  Did you buy a ticket at the tick et machine?

I think it’s obvious we have the best scriptwriter on the Internet; that’s because we have the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Types of People at Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 772: Types of People at Work.

This episode is a dialogue between Raul and Ursula about the kind of people you may work with.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Raul:  Thanks for showing me around on my first day .

Ursula:  It’s no problem.  I want to give you the l ay of the land and tell you about the people you’ll be working with.  For instance, t hat’s Julie over there.  She’s really nice, but she’s also a perfectionist.  If yo u ever work with her, remember that she’s a stickler about everything.

Raul:  Okay, I’ll remember that.

Ursula:  And Phil over there?  He’s a slacker and a  troublemaker.  Stay away from him, far, far away.

Raul:  Thanks for the warning.

Ursula:  And that’s Luis.  You’ll be working under him.  He’s a slave driver and a workaholic, and he expects everybody else to be one , too.

Raul:  That doesn’t sound good.

Ursula:  Don’t sweat it.  Standing next to Luis is Gil.  He’s a yes-man and very, very ambitious, almost ruthless.  Don’t get in Gil’ s way.

Raul:  Okay, I won’t.  Thanks for showing me around .  By the way, who’s the office gossip?

 Ursula:  Oh, we don’t have one of those around here .

[end of dialogue]

Raul begins by saying, “Thanks for showing me aroun d on my first day.”  “To show (someone) around” means to give someone a tour  or what we might call an “orientation,” showing them or teaching them where things are.  We often would say that to someone who is new to an office: “Let m e show you around,” let me introduce you to the people who work here, let me t ell you where things are in the office, and so forth.  You could also show someone around who is visiting you from another country or another place.

Raul thanks Ursula for showing him around on his fi rst day – his first day at work. Ursula says, “It’s no problem.  I want to give you the lay of the land.”  The expression “the lay (lay) of the land” here means h ow things are organized, where things are found.  It might be used in a very  general way to tell someone how something is organized.  It could be a report o r a book; it could be the people in an organization.  In this case, it’s the people in the office.  Ursula says she wants to give Raul the lay of the land and tell  him about the people he’ll be working with.  “For instance (for example), that’s Julie over there,” she says, “She’s really nice, but she’s also a perfectionist. ”  “To be perfect” means to have nothing wrong.  A “perfectionist” wants everything to be without an error – without a mistake; everything has to be perfect.  Someone w ho always wants to be perfect is a perfectionist; that can be a good thin g, that can sometimes be a bad thing.  Ursula says, “If you ever work with Julie, remember that she’s a stickler about everything.”  “To be a stickler” (stickler) m eans to follow the rules exactly, and insist – make sure – that everyone else follows  the rules exactly.  It can also be another word to describe a perfectionist.  Someo ne might say, “I’m a stickler for details.”  That is, I want every little thing t o be correct.  You can be a stickler for something: something that you are very strict a bout, something that you want to make sure is absolutely perfect.

Raul says, “Okay, I’ll remember that (Julie is a st ickler about everything).”  Ursula says, “And Phil over there?  He’s a slacker and a t roublemaker.”  “To be a slacker” (slacker) is to be lazy, someone who doesn ’t work very hard, someone who doesn’t do their job or do what they’re suppose d to do at their job.  You don’t want to be working with a slacker, someone who neve r does what they’re supposed to do.  “My nephew is a slacker.  He never  works very hard; he doesn’t get very much done.”  I just won’t tell you which n ephew of my 20 nephews I’m talking about, but you know who you are, nephew!  U rsula also says that Phil is a troublemaker.  A “troublemaker” (all one word) is a  person who creates problems,

who makes trouble, who creates difficulties for oth er people.  Sometimes we talk about a student in school being a troublemaker, cau sing problems in class or getting into trouble outside of school.  But you co uld also be a troublemaker in an organization or a business, where you are always pe rhaps complaining or causing problems.  Ursula says that Raul should sta y away from Phil, far, far away, meaning don’t have anything to do with him.  Raul says, “Thanks for the warning.”  A “warning” is advice about something th at is dangerous or difficult that might happen in the future.  If someone says, “Be careful walking on the ground there, it’s very icy, you could slip and fal l,” that’s a warning, that’s telling you something bad could happen in the future if you ’re not careful.

Ursula continues, “And that’s Luis.  You’ll be work ing under him.”  “To work under (someone)” means that someone will be your boss, th at person under whom you are working.  “I work under John,” that means John is my boss; John is the person who is my manager, who tells me what I’m sup posed to do.  Ursula calls Luis a “slave driver.”  A “slave” is a person who i s owned by someone else – who is the property of someone else.  Slavery, of cours e, is illegal in almost every country, if not every country.  When slavery was le gal, the people who were in charge of the slaves – who made the slaves work har d – were called the “slave drivers,” and that’s where this expression comes fr om.  It’s someone who makes you work very hard, even if you’re not technically or legally a slave.  Ursula says that Luis is a workaholic.  A “workaholic” (workaho lic) is someone who works constantly; we might say that he is addicted to wor k, someone who works very, very hard all day, even at night.  Someone perhaps who loves to work a lot, that’s usually the idea.  When someone says, “I’m a workah olic,” that means that they like to do it.  They’re addicted to it, just like w e have the expression “alcoholic,” that’s where “workaholic” comes from; that’s where we created that word from.

Well, Ursula says that Luis is not only a workaholi c, “he expects everyone else to be one, too.”  Everyone else must also work as hard  as he does.  Raul says, “That doesn’t sound good.”  Remember, Luis is going  to be Raul’s boss.  Ursula says, “Don’t sweat it.”  The expression “don’t swea t (sweat) it” means don’t worry about it, don’t get too concerned.  I’m not sure wh y; I would be concerned!  Then Ursula says, “Standing next to Luis is Gil.  Gil is  a yes-man (yes-man).”  Ursula says that Gil is a yes-man.  A “yes-man” is someone  who is always agreeing with his boss or the supervisor, someone who wants to ma ke his or her boss happy so they always say, “Oh, yes, that’s right.  Oh, ye s, I agree with you.”  They never say no to anything their bosses tell them.  Ursula says that Gil is very “ambitious.”  He wants to succeed; he wants to move  up in the company; he wants to get a better job, be more successful.  Urs ula calls Gil “almost ruthless.” “To be ruthless” (ruthless) is to not care about an yone else’s feelings, to not care

who you hurt; you’re going to get what you want and  it’s not important to you if you hurt other people.

Ursula says to Raul, “Don’t get in Gil’s way.”  “To  get in (someone’s) way” (way) means to interfere with someone, to prevent someone  from doing something they want to do.  Raul says, “Okay, I won’t (I won’t get  in Gil’s way).”  He says, “Thanks for showing me around.  By the way” – we us e “by the way” as a way of saying oh, one more thing, or I forgot to tell you or forgot to ask you – “By the way, who’s the office gossip?”  A “gossip” (gossip)  is a person who tells other people secrets, who gives private information about  someone else to another person.  Usually these are negative things about so meone else.  “To gossip” can be a verb; it means to talk in this way, to talk ab out other people’s problems: “Did you hear that John didn’t come home last night and that his wife is really angry at him?”  Well, that would be gossip, telling bad thin gs, usually, about other people. Generally speaking, that’s a bad idea.  Ursula answ ers by saying, “Oh, we don’t have one of those around here.”  Of course, Ursula is the office gossip; she’s the one who’s telling Raul all these negative things ab out his coworkers.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Raul:  Thanks for showing me around on my first day .

Ursula:  It’s no problem.  I want to give you the l ay of the land and tell you about the people you’ll be working with.  For instance, t hat’s Julie over there.  She’s really nice, but she’s also a perfectionist.  If yo u ever work with her, remember that she’s a stickler about everything.

# Dealing With Debt

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 773: Dealing With Debt.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 773.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in – say it with me – beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com; you know that.  You know  that you can go there to download a Learning Guide with all of the words, de finitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cu ltural notes, and a complete transcript of this episode.  You know that.  Did yo u also know that we’re on Facebook?  Well, we are: facebook.com/eslpod.

This episode is a dialogue about “debt,” when you o we other people money, when you borrow money.  That, of course, can someti mes lead to problems. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kristin:  Let’s go shopping!

Ed:  Wait a second.  What are all these?

Kristin:  They’re bills, but they don’t have to be paid yet.  Don’t worry.  Let’s go! There’s a new pair of shoes with my name on it.

Ed:  Hold on a minute.  This is a notice saying tha t you’re behind on your house payments and if you don’t pay soon, your house will  go into foreclosure.

Kristin:  Oh, they’re just bluffing.  I’m only a li ttle behind in my payments.  I’ll get to it next week.

Ed:  And this is a notice from your bank telling yo u that your car is being repossessed because you haven’t made a car payment in three months.  Is that true?

Kristin:  I refuse to look at anything as boring as  a bill today.

Ed:  And these are from the power company and the p hone company.  They’re going to cut off your services if you don’t pay now .

 Kristin:  If I could just charge those payments, I’ d be okay.

Ed:  Not with these credit cards.  You’re maxed out .  I’m surprised you haven’t heard from collection agencies already.

Kristin:  Maybe I have.  They can hound me all they  want, but I’m not that  behind on my payments.  I’m tired of waiting.  I’m going s hopping with or without you.

Ed:  You’re on your own.  I refuse to help you towa rd your financial ruin!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Kristin saying to Ed, “Let ’s go shopping!”  Let’s go buy some things.  Ed says, “Wait.  What are all these?”   He’s looking at something. Kristin says, “They’re bills, but they don’t have t o be paid yet.”  “Bills” (bills – the singular is “bill”) are statements saying how much money you owe a company. Usually when you have some sort of service, the com pany that is giving you the service – or the product – sends you a bill.  You can have a gas bill, an electric bill, a telephone bill; you have to usually pay the se every month.  Kristin says these bills that Ed is looking at don’t have to be paid yet.  “Don’t worry,” she says, “Let’s go!  There’s a new pair of shoes with my nam e on it.”  The expression “there’s (something) with your name on it” is used to describe something that you want to have very badly; you have plans to buy it.  So for example if I was going to buy a new car, I might say, “Oh, there’s a Mazda  Miata with my name on it,” or, “There’s a Ford pickup truck with my name on it ,” meaning those are things that I want to buy.  Of course, it doesn’t actually  have your name on it; you’re saying that that is something that you are going to  get.

Ed says, “Hold on a minute.  This is a notice (this  is a letter) saying that you’re behind on your house payments and if you don’t pay soon, your house will go into foreclosure.”  “To be behind on (something)” m eans to be late, not to be doing something as you had scheduled.  “I’m behind on my accounting.”  I was supposed to finish my accounts last week and I’m st ill working on it.  “I’m behind on my bills” means the bills were supposed to be pa id last month and I haven’t paid them yet.  In this case, Kristin is behind on her house payments.  When you buy a house in the United States, usually you get a  loan from the bank – you borrow money from the bank, they lend you money – a nd then you have to, of course, pay the loan back every month.  That’s what  “house payments” are.  Ed says that the notice says that the house payments of Kristin are behind schedule, and that her house may go into foreclosure.  “Forec losure” (foreclosure) is what happens when you don’t pay your loan back to the ba nk.  If you take a long time,

and you don’t give the bank their money every month , the bank can come and take your house from you because you haven’t paid t he loan back.  This, unfortunately, has happened a lot here in the Unite d States in the last few years.

Kristin says, “Oh, they’re just bluffing.”  “To blu ff” (bluff) means to say something, to say that you’re going to do something bad, but y ou don’t really mean it.  You’re not serious; you won’t actually do that.  Sometimes  we use the verb “bluff” when we’re playing cards, a card game like poker.  You s ay that you have something, but you don’t actually have anything.  You’re bluff ing; you’re lying, basically.  So, “to bluff” can be to lie, or “to bluff” can be to t hreaten to do something bad but not be serious about it, not actually intend to do it.  Kristin says, “I’m only a little behind in my payments.  I’ll get to it next week.”  “I’ll get to it” means I will take care of it, I will handle it later.

Ed – who for some reason is looking through Kristin ’s mail, I’m not sure why – sees another letter – another piece of paper – that  is a notice from Kristin’s bank telling her that her car is being repossessed.  “To  repossess” is similar to a foreclosure; the bank comes and takes back what it gave you or what you borrowed money to buy – the bank didn’t give it to you, but the bank gave you the money to buy the house or buy the car.  Now for  a house, when the bank comes and says we’re taking your house from you, th at’s called a “foreclosure.” When it’s anything else, like a car or maybe you bo rrowed money to buy furniture or whatever it is, we call it “repossession.”  “To possess” means to own or to have something.  “To repossess” means to take somet hing from someone else, usually someone who has borrowed money from you.  T here was a movie many years ago called the Repo Man  (repo).  “Repo” stands for repossess.  Usually, we talk about this verb when dealing with someone’s  car, when they borrow money for a car and they don’t pay their loan.  Ed says that Kristin’s car is being repossessed because she hasn’t made a car payment i n three months. Remember we talked about house payments, money you pay to the bank every month for the loan that you have; that loan is call ed a “mortgage” when you by a house.  Well, this is a car loan, and for car loans  you have car payments; you pay the bank every month for the loan they gave you to buy your car.  Ed says, “Is that true?”

Kristin says, “I refuse to look at anything as bori ng as a bill today.”  She thinks that her bills are not interesting; they’re boring,  so she’s just not going to look at them.  Ed continues to go through Kristin’s mail.  He says, “these (these letters) are from the power company and the phone company.”  The power company is the company you buy your electricity from.  Usually  there’s just one power company for a given area.  Sometimes the local gove rnment owns the power company, but in many places a private company has t he contract to give

everyone electricity.  A phone company is always, a t least in the U.S., a private company that provides you with telephone service.  Ed says that the power company and the phone company are going to cut off Kristin’s services if she doesn’t pay her bills.  “To cut off your services” means to stop giving you what you were paying for – or what you haven’t paid for,  in this case.  So, to cut off your power, to cut off your phone service, that’s w hat will happen if you don’t pay your bills.

Kristin says, “If I could just charge those payment s, I’d be okay.”  “To charge” (charge) means to use a credit card to pay a bill.  You don’t have the cash – the money, so you use a credit card, a Visa or a Master Card, to pay the bill.  The word “charge” also has some other meanings in Engli sh; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.  Ed says that Kristin can ’t charge the bills; he says, “Not with these credit cards.  They’re maxed out.”  “To max (max) out” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to use the most you possi bly can of something. “Max” is short for “maximize,” it’s related to the word “maximum,” the most of something.  Well, to max out your credit cards mean s to use all of your credit. The bank usually gives you maybe 1,000 or 2,000 or 5,000 dollars that you can spend with your credit card, but then it says okay,  no more.  Well, Kristin has maxed out her credit cards; she can’t use them anym ore until she pays her bills.

Ed says, “I’m surprised you haven’t heard from coll ection agencies already.”  A “collection agency” is a company that helps other c ompanies get their money from customers who don’t pay.  So if you have a cel l phone and you don’t pay your bill, after a few months another company – a c ollection agency – might call you and say hey, we want the money.  Now, they can’ t come and hurt you, but they can do other things that will hurt you financi ally if you don’t pay your bill.

Kristin says, “Maybe I have,” meaning maybe I have heard from collection agencies.  She’s saying that these agencies have pr obably already contacted her.  She says, “They can hound me all they want.”  “To hound (hound) (someone)” means to bother someone, usually by aski ng for something over and over again.  “His wife hounded him about cutting the lawn,” about cutting the grass outside.  Or, “He hounded the employee to fin ish her work.”  To be constantly asking someone.  Well here, we’re talkin g about collection agencies hounding you, calling you, and that’s what collecti on agencies I think will do. They keep calling you until you pay your bill.  Kri stin says, “I’m not that  behind on my payments (meaning I’m not very behind; I’m not t hat late).  I’m tired of waiting.  I’m going shopping with or without you.”  So Kristin doesn’t want to pay her loans or worry about all of these problems with  her debt, she’s just going to go shopping.

Ed says, “You’re on your own,” meaning you have to do this by yourself, I am not going to go with you.  He says, “I refuse to help y ou toward your financial ruin!” “Ruin” (ruin) is a very bad situation, when you are  completely destroyed, when the worst thing has happened to you.  Financial rui n is when you don’t have any money anymore; you don’t have any way of getting mo ney.  You have maxed out all your credit cards, you’re house is in foreclosu re, your car has been repossessed; we might call that “financial ruin.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kristin:  Let’s go shopping!

Ed:  Wait a second.  What are all these?

Kristin:  They’re bills, but they don’t have to be paid yet.  Don’t worry.  Let’s go! There’s a new pair of shoes with my name on it.

Ed:  Hold on a minute.  This is a notice saying tha t you’re behind on your house payments and if you don’t pay soon, your house will  go into foreclosure.

Kristin:  Oh, they’re just bluffing.  I’m only a li ttle behind in my payments.  I’ll get to it next week.

Ed:  And this is a notice from your bank telling yo u that your car is being repossessed because you haven’t made a car payment in three months.  Is that true?

Kristin:  I refuse to look at anything as boring as  a bill today.

Ed:  And these are from the power company and the p hone company.  They’re going to cut off your services if you don’t pay now .

Kristin:  If I could just charge those payments, I’ d be okay.

Ed:  Not with these credit cards.  You’re maxed out .  I’m surprised you haven’t heard from collection agencies already.

Kristin:  Maybe I have.  They can hound me all they  want, but I’m not that  behind on my payments.  I’m tired of waiting.  I’m going s hopping with or without you.

 Ed:  You’re on your own.  I refuse to help you towa rd your financial ruin!

# Describing Height and Build

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 774: Describing Height and Build.

This episode is a dialogue describing people’s “hei ght,” how tall they are, as well as their “build,” what they look like: are they fat , are they skinny, and so forth. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gwen:  Do you see that heavyset guy over there, the  one towering over everyone else?

Denzel:  Yeah, what about him?

Gwen:  He’s my ex-boyfriend.  I haven’t seen him in  years.  When I knew him he was really skinny.  He’s really put on a few pounds .  It’s amazing what a few years can do.

Denzel:  None of us are as svelte as we used to be.

Gwen:  That’s true enough.  I’m not as petite as I used to be, that’s for sure.

Denzel:  How come you’ve never mentioned this ex-bo yfriend before?

Gwen:  Oh, I’d almost forgotten about him.  Oh, no.   I hope that guy over there didn’t see me.

Denzel:  Who?  That short, stocky guy?

Gwen:  No, the average height guy who’s walking thi s way.  He’s another one of my exes.  I’d hoped never to see him again.

 Denzel:  It was a bad breakup?

Gwen:  Right.  Let’s head toward the door.

Denzel:  Why hadn’t you mentioned him before?

Gwen:  I thought I had.  There have been so many…

Denzel:  Don’t look now, but your ex is also headed  toward the door.

Gwen:  Which one?

Denzel:  The tall medium build guy walking next to you!

[end of dialogue]

There are many words we can used to describe someon e physically; it’s impossible to include all of these in a single dial ogue.  This dialogue only talks about how tall or short someone is, as well as thei r shape and weight, in a way.

Gwen says to Denzel, “Do you see that heavyset guy over there, the one towering over everyone else?”  “Heavyset” (heavyset ) is someone who is a little overweight, perhaps.  They weigh a little too much;  they’re a little fat, but they’re also very large and often very strong.  They might have a lot of muscles, like me. Yeah!  Well, not really.  Gwen says, “Do you see th at heavyset guy over there, the one towering over everyone else?”  “To tower (t ower) over (someone)” means to be much taller than everyone else, or much  taller than the person next to you.

Denzel says, “Yeah, what about him?”  Gwen says tha t this heavyset guy is her ex-boyfriend.  Your “boyfriend” is the man, or boy,  you are interested in romantically; the other term, of course, would be “ girlfriend.”  “Ex-boyfriend” would be someone who used to be your boyfriend, but  you’re not together romantically anymore.  Gwen says, “I haven’t seen h im in years (I haven’t seen this heavyset guy in years).  When I knew him he wa s really skinny.”  “To be skinny” (skinny) means to be very thin; we might say “slim” or “slender” (slender). “Slim,” “slender,” “thin,” “skinny,” these are all the same idea, someone who doesn’t have a lot of extra weight, who is the oppo site of fat.  Gwen says that the ex-boyfriend really put on a few pounds.  “To put o n a few pounds” (pounds) means to gain weight, usually over time.  As people  get older, especially after, oh, the age of 30 or so, it’s not uncommon for them  to put on a few pounds, to

gain weight, to become heavier or fatter.  “Pound” has a number of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for some of those.

Gwen says, “It’s amazing what a few years can do,” meaning it’s surprising how someone can change physically in just a few years.  Denzel says, “None of us are as svelte as we used to be.”  “Svelte” (svelte)  means to be slender, to be thin. But the difference between “svelte” and “skinny” is  that when you say you’re “svelte” you mean you are perhaps somewhat muscular  or you are svelte in a way that looks very attractive.  You can be skinny and not be very attractive, but when you’re svelte usually you not only are thin bu t you also have a good muscular look about you as well.  At least that’s a  common way of using this word.  Gwen says, “That’s true enough.  I’m not as petite as I used to be.”  “To be petite” (petite) is to be a thin or skinny woman wh o’s usually somewhat small or short.  A petite woman is not very tall and is thin .  If you go to a store, and you’re woman and you’re buying a dress, they have differen t sizes, and petite might be one of the sizes they have.  That would be for a wo man who’s not very tall and who is thin.

Denzel then asks Gwen, “How come you’ve never menti oned this ex-boyfriend before?”  Why haven’t you told me about this ex-boy friend?  Gwen said, “Oh, I’d almost forgotten about him.”  I couldn’t remember h im, maybe because it was so long ago.  Then she says, “Oh, no.  I hope that guy  over there didn’t see me.” Gwen is now talking about a different person.  Gwen  says, “I hope that guy over there didn’t see me.”  Denzel says, “Who?  That sho rt, stocky guy?”  “To be short” means the opposite of tall, someone who’s be low average in height. “Short” has a number of meanings in English however ; take a look, once again, at our Learning Guide for those.  “To be stocky” (s tocky) means to be a little heavy.  You could be a little fat, or you might jus t have a lot of strong muscles. Normally it describes someone who is perhaps not ve ry tall, but they’re heavy; they’re slightly overweight and/or they have a lot of muscles, so they look big.

Gwen says, “No,” she’s not talking about the short,  stocky guy; she’s talking about the guy who is of average height.  “Height” r efers to how tall or short you are.  “Average” would be someone who is about the s ame as most people; “typical” would be another way of saying that.  Sta tistically, “average” is the same as what we call the “mean” (mean).  The mean of 5 a nd 15 is 10; 5 plus 15 is 20, divided by 2 is 10.  Well, here we’re talking about  an average height, how tall someone is.  Gwen says that there’s an average heig ht guy walking this way, meaning walking toward Gwen and Denzel.  She says, “He’s another one of my exes (another ex-boyfriend).  I’d hoped never to se e him again.”  She doesn’t want to see this person.

Denzel says, “It was a bad breakup?”  A “breakup” ( breakup – one word) is the end of a romantic relationship, when two people dec ide they’re not going to be together romantically anymore; you’re no longer boy friend and girlfriend.  Denzel says, “It was a bad breakup?”  Gwen says, “Right,” meaning yes.  Notice that Gwen seems to have a lot of ex-boyfriends, and Denz el doesn’t seem to know anything about them.  Is that a good idea?  Should you tell your boyfriend or your girlfriend about all of the old boyfriends or girlf riends you used to have?  I don’t know; I don’t know if that’s a good idea.  I don’t think so, generally.  Maybe I’m wrong; I don’t have very many ex-girlfriends to tal k about!  In general, I think it’s a bad idea.  Well anyway, Gwen says, “Let’s head towa rd the door.”  Let’s start walking out of here, to leave.

Denzel says, “Why hadn’t you mentioned him before?”   Denzel wants to know why Gwen hasn’t told him about her ex-boyfriends.  Again, personally I don’t care.  I don’t want to know about your ex-boyfriend s, but Denzel wants to know. Gwen says, “I thought I had (I thought I did tell y ou).  There have been so many.” She’s saying that she’s had many boyfriends.  Now t hat’s probably a mistake ladies!  You don’t want to tell your current boyfri end, the guy you’re with right now, that you’ve had lots of boyfriends in the past .  That doesn’t look too good sometimes.  And, I would say probably the same for a man telling that to a woman.  But in any case, Gwen tells Denzel that she  has had many boyfriends.

Denzel says, “Don’t look now, but your ex is also h eaded toward the door.” “Don’t look now” is a phrase we use to warn someone  that something bad is coming their way or someone they don’t want to see is walking toward them. Denzel says, “Don’t look now, but your ex (your ex- boyfriend) is also headed toward the door.”  Gwen says, “Which one?”  She thi nks Denzel is talking about the heavyset guy or the average height guy, but Den zel says, “The tall medium build guy walking next to you!”  “Tall,” of course,  is the opposite of short.  “To be medium (medium) build (build)” means that you’re no t fat, you’re not thin; you’re sort of average in terms of the size of your body.  So, Denzel is talking about a tall medium build guy walking next to Gwen, meaning  himself.  He’s saying that now he is going to break up with Gwen, and Gwen is walking next to her newest ex-boyfriend!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gwen:  Do you see that heavyset guy over there, the  one towering over everyone else?

Denzel:  Yeah, what about him?

Gwen:  He’s my ex-boyfriend.  I haven’t seen him in  years.  When I knew him he was really skinny.  He’s really put on a few pounds .  It’s amazing what a few years can do.

Denzel:  None of us are as svelte as we used to be.

Gwen:  That’s true enough.  I’m not as petite as I used to be, that’s for sure.

Denzel:  How come you’ve never mentioned this ex-bo yfriend before?

Gwen:  Oh, I’d almost forgotten about him.  Oh, no.   I hope that guy over there didn’t see me.

Denzel:  Who?  That short, stocky guy?

Gwen:  No, the average height guy who’s walking thi s way.  He’s another one of my exes.  I’d hoped never to see him again.

Denzel:  It was a bad breakup?

Gwen:  Right.  Let’s head toward the door.

Denzel:  Why hadn’t you mentioned him before?

Gwen:  I thought I had.  There have been so many…

Denzel:  Don’t look now, but your ex is also headed  toward the door.

Gwen:  Which one?

Denzel:  The tall medium build guy walking next to you!

[end of dialogue]

I don’t know anything about her ex-boyfriends, but I do know Dr. Lucy Tse is a wonderful scriptwriter.





# Making Repairs on the Outside of a House

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 775: Making Repairs on the Outside of a House.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 775.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Eslpod.com, that’s our website.  Go there, become a  member, support this podcast.

This episode is called “Making Repairs on the Outsi de of a House.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Maggie:  Watch out!  Are you okay?

Conrad:  I’m fine, but I almost tripped over that c rack in the driveway.  We’ve got to get that fixed.

Maggie:  I know it’s a hazard, but first things fir st.  We should fix those broken front steps, don’t you think?

Conrad:  I see what you mean.

Maggie:  And we have to repair that part of the fen ce that’s falling down.  See?  If it leans any more, we won’t be able to open the gat e.

Conrad:  Oh, I didn’t realize the fence was falling  down.  Yes, you’re right, we should take care of those things first.

Maggie:  And the porch light is out.  I’m not sure if we just need to replace the bulb, or if it’s an electrical issue.

Conrad:  I didn’t realize the outside of our house was in such disrepair.  I’ve been traveling too much for work.

Maggie:  I admit I’ve been putting off the repairs,  too.

Conrad:  All right, I know what we’ll be doing this  weekend – all weekend!

 [end of dialogue]

Maggie begins by saying to Conrad, “Watch out!”  “W atch out” means be careful. It’s a phrase we use to warn someone that something  bad is going to happen very soon, usually something that may hurt them phy sically.  Maggie says, “Are you okay?”  Conrad says, “I’m fine, but I almost tr ipped over that crack in the driveway.”  “To trip (trip) over (something)” means  to hit your foot on something and then to fall.  In our story – our dialogue, Con rad trips over a crack that is in the driveway.  The “driveway” is an area where you can drive your car.  When you pull your car off of the street – when you driv e it off of the street next to your house or your apartment building, the place between  the street and the garage where you drive your car, that’s called the “drivew ay” (one word).  A “crack” is when you have an opening in either a wall or it cou ld be, in this case, the driveway.  The driveway is made of a very hard mate rial called “concrete” typically, and sometimes there are holes – there are lines that form in the concrete, and this causes the driveway to have an u neven spot, a spot where suddenly it’s a little higher, a little taller than  what comes before it.  And if you are walking along, and you don’t see it, you could trip  over it.  It’s sort of like if there were a piece of wood lying on the ground, and you d idn’t see it.  Your foot would hit it and you might fall.

Conrad says that he has to get this crack fixed.  “ To fix” means to repair, to get it so that it is normal again.  Maggie said, “I know it’s a hazard, but first things first.” A “hazard” (hazard) is something that could cause d amage or injury, something that could hurt you.  The adjective “hazardous” is used to describe things – liquids, chemicals, materials – that can hurt you.  A “hazard,” as a noun, is that thing, that thing that could hurt you.  Maggie says , “first things first,” however. The expression “first things first” is used to mean  that you need to do the most important things first.  You have lots of things to  do today, but you have to put them in a certain priority.  It’s become popular in  the last few decades to say “prioritize,” to make a verb out of “priority.”  Do n’t really love that; prefer, myself, just to say “to make it a priority.”  That’s what M aggie says: we need to do first things first, the most important things first.  She  thinks that is to fix those broken front steps.  The “front steps” (steps) are the sta irs that go from the outside of the house to the inside of the house; it’s what allows you to go into a house if the door is higher up than the ground outside.  We call  these “steps” when they’re outside of the house; inside of the house we would call them “stairs.”  However, that’s not always the case.  Sometimes people will talk about the steps as being the individual levels of the stairs.  So, you could  talk about the second step of the stairs.  But when someone says “front steps,” they’ re always referring to the

stairs or steps that are on the outside of the hous e that allow you to come into the house.

Conrad says, “I see what you mean.”  He agrees with  Maggie.  Maggie then says, “And we have to repair that part of the fence  that’s falling down.”  A “fence” (fence) is like a wall that you have around your ho use.  Normally it’s made of wood or metal, and it keeps people from coming into  your house, or it may keep animals or children from going outside of your prop erty.  You often have a fence separating two different properties – two different  houses here in the United States.  I have a fence in the back of my house and  on both sides of my house, separating me from the houses around me.

Well, Maggie thinks that the fence needs to be fixe d because it’s falling down, meaning parts of it are broken, or it is going to h it the ground.  It’s going to instead of be vertical, up and down, it’s going to be lying down on the ground and then, of course, it wouldn’t be a fence anymore.  T hat’s really what Maggie means.  She says, “If the fence leans any more, we won’t be able to open the gate.”  “To lean” (lean) can mean to rest yourself against something else.  If you are standing up and you are tired, you may lean aga inst the wall.  Your body will touch the wall sort of as if you were resting.  For  a fence to lean, however, we mean that is no longer perfectly vertical; it is st arting to fall down towards the ground.

Maggie says that if the fence leans any more than it is now, “we won’t be able to open the gate.”  The “gate” is a door in the fence that allows you to go in and out of the area that the fence is protecting.  So it’s a way to go through the fence; it’s a door in the fence.  Conrad says, “Oh, I didn’t re alize the fence was falling down. Yes, you’re right, we should take care of those thi ngs first.”  Conrad is the perfect husband, you see here, he’s agreeing to everything his wife is telling him!

Maggie says, because now she sees that Conrad is ag reeing with her, “And the porch light is out.”  The “porch” is an area in fro nt of your house that’s part of the house, but usually is not an area that has windows.   That’s not always true, either.  In my house – my old house where I lived i n Minnesota we had a porch, but it was a porch that had windows so that you cou ld sit outside there.  Usually a porch isn’t heated in the wintertime, it’s not part  of the regular house, and that’s probably the only difference that I can think of in  terms of the porch that I grew up with.  Many people have outdoor porches that are ju st areas that are covered, they have sort of a little roof over them, in front  of the house where they can sit and watch the people walk by I guess.

There’s a light in the porch of Conrad and Maggie’s  house that is out.  When we say it’s “out,” we mean it’s broken; in this case, the light no longer works.  Usually “out” is used to describe a light that no longer wo rks, no longer “comes on” we would say, or “turns on.”  Maggie says, “I’m not su re if we just need to replace (or put in a new) bulb, or if it’s an electrical issue. ”  “Bulb” (bulb) is a light bulb, that’s the thing that produces the light.  “Electrical” re fers to “electricity,” which is the power that turns, in this case, the light bulb on.  If it’s an electrical issue, it may be something with the wires, for example.  Those are the long, thin pieces of metal that bring power to the light bulb, or to any  other electrical device.

Conrad says, “I didn’t realize the outside of our h ouse was in such disrepair.” “Disrepair” means broken, not working correctly.  H e says, “I’ve been traveling too much for work,” meaning I have been traveling f or my job, and so I haven’t seen all of these problems.  Maggie says, “I admit I’ve been putting off the repairs, too.”  “To put off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to delay doing something, especially something that should be done  now.  “I’m going to put off that decision.”  I’m not going to decide today, I’m  going to do it next week.  So, “to put off” means to delay.  Conrad says, “All rig ht, I know what we’ll be doing this weekend – all weekend!” meaning it’s going to take all of our days this weekend, this Saturday and Sunday, to finish repair ing all of these problems on the outside of the house.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Maggie:  Watch out!  Are you okay?

Conrad:  I’m fine, but I almost tripped over that c rack in the driveway.  We’ve got to get that fixed.

Maggie:  I know it’s a hazard, but first things fir st.  We should fix those broken front steps, don’t you think?

Conrad:  I see what you mean.

Maggie:  And we have to repair that part of the fen ce that’s falling down.  See?  If it leans any more, we won’t be able to open the gat e.

Conrad:  Oh, I didn’t realize the fence was falling  down.  Yes, you’re right, we should take care of those things first.

Maggie:  And the porch light is out.  I’m not sure if we just need to replace the bulb, or if it’s an electrical issue.

Conrad:  I didn’t realize the outside of our house was in such disrepair.  I’ve been traveling too much for work.

Maggie:  I admit I’ve been putting off the repairs,  too.

Conrad:  All right, I know what we’ll be doing this  weekend – all weekend!

This episode is a dialogue between Rene and Bruno a bout getting praise, when people say good things about you.  Let’s get starte d.

[start of dialogue]

Rene:  Hey, look who’s here.  It’s the company’s go lden boy.

Bruno:  Very funny.

Rene:  I’m not joking.  First, you’re recognized at  the annual meeting for your work in the company, and then you get a commendatio n from the city for your volunteer work.  I’m basking in your reflected glor y.

Bruno:  I didn’t ask for either honor, as you well know.  I’m not a glory hound.

Rene:  Yes, and that’s what makes it even more gall ing.  You don’t have to go seeking your glory; it comes to you.

Bruno:  Knock it off!  I like praise as much as the  next guy, but I’d rather not be in the limelight.

Rene:  I know.  You’re exceptional and you’re modes t about it.  You’re the perfect guy.  You leave us mere mortals in the dust.

Bruno:  I’m leaving.  I know you love giving me a h ard time, but remember this: I give as good as I get – and I have a long memory!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Rene saying, “Hey, look wh o’s here.”  What happens here is that Bruno is walking into the room, and Re ne is talking about Bruno. She’s saying, “Hey, look who’s here.”  Look at who has just come into the room. “It’s the company’s golden boy.”  The expression “g olden boy” refers to someone who’s very successful or gifted or talented that ot her people admire.  Rene is being funny; she’s being sarcastic here; however, s he isn’t really praising or saying nice things about Bruno.  Bruno understands that; he says, “Very funny,” meaning he knows it’s not funny.  Rene says, “I’m n ot joking.  First, you’re recognized at the annual meeting for your work in t he company.”  “To be recognized” here means that someone says something nice about you, someone compliments you – praises you in public, usually in  front of a group of people or in some newspaper or official publication.  That’s to be recognized.  “To recognize” can also mean that you see someone or so mething and you remember what it is because you’ve seen it before.  But here, it just means to be praised, to be complimented on something.

Rene says, “First, you are recognized at the annual  meeting (that is, a meeting for the whole company that happens once a year), th en you get a commendation from the city for your volunteer work.”  A “commend ation” is an official often certificate or a letter that is given someone to th ank them for their work.  It’s an award that an organization or a government agency o r a government organization might give someone for the work that t hey have done – the good work that they have done.  In this case, Bruno has done volunteer work; he has worked without being paid for some group.

Rene says, “I’m basking in your reflected glory.”  “To bask” (bask) usually means to sit in the sun so that you can get a tan, or sim ply for the pleasure of feeling the warmth of the sun.  But it’s often used, this verb “to bask,” with the word “glory” to mean to enjoy all of the good things that are happe ning to you, the praise, the compliments that people are giving you.  “I’m going  to bask in the glory of my victory.”  Everyone is thanking me or congratulatin g me, looking at me, saying nice things about me.  I’m going to bask in that; I ’m going to enjoy it.  What Rene is saying, however, is a little different.  She’s s aying, “I’m basking in your reflected glory.”  When light hits a mirror, it’s r eflected, it goes off of the mirror and back out again.  What Rene is saying is that sh e doesn’t have any glory of her own, no one is praising her, but people are pra ising Bruno and so she’s enjoying the praise that is reflected from Bruno to  her because all of the wonderful things that Bruno has done and has been r ecognized for.  Once again, she’s making a joke here.

Bruno says, “I didn’t ask for either honor, as you well know.”  An “honor” (honor) is recognition or praise that you receive, usually from a powerful organization or

person.  The president may give you an honor, such as giving you an award for something.  Bruno says that he didn’t ask for these  honors; he didn’t try to get these honors.  He says, “I’m not a glory hound.”  A  “glory hound” (hound) is someone who is always looking for praise, someone w ho always wants to be recognized, who wants everyone to say nice things a bout them.  Rene says, “Yes,” she understands that Bruno is not a glory ho und, “and that’s what makes it even more galling.”  Something that is “galling” (g alling) is something that is annoying or irritating because it seems unfair.  Re ne says, “You don’t have to go seeking your glory; it comes to you.”

Bruno says, “Knock it off!”  “Knock it off” means s top it; it’s an informal expression that means stop doing what you’re doing.  You don’t  like it, you want the other person to stop it.  A child may be screaming or tal king loudly or crying, and the mother may say, “Knock it off,” meaning stop doing that.  Bruno says, “Knock it off.  I like praise as much as the next guy.”  “Pra ise” is something nice that someone says about you.  The expression “as much as  the next guy” is used to emphasize that you are normal, that you are just li ke everyone else, that you are no different than everyone else.  He says, “I like praise (I like to be complimented) as much as the next guy (just like ev eryone else), but I’d rather not be in the limelight.”  The “limelight” (limelig ht – one word) means to have a lot of attention, when everyone is looking on you.  It could mean that your picture is in the newspaper, and the television news is talkin g about you; that’s to be in the limelight

Rene says, “I know.  You’re exceptional and you’re modest about it.” “Exceptional” means very good at something, better than anyone else, “extraordinary” we might say.  Rene says that Bruno  is exceptional and he’s modest about it.  “To be modest” (modest) means to be humble, not to talk to other people about it.  Here, “to be modest” means to be good, but not to talk about it to everyone else.  Rene says, “You’re the perfect guy.  You leave us mere mortals in the dust.”  A “mortal” (mortal) is someone who will die, all of us human beings are mortal, but the expression “mere m ortals” means ordinary people, people who aren’t extraordinary, who are no t exceptional.  “To leave (someone) in the dust” means to beat another person  in a competition, to be superior to someone else, to win in such a way that  the other person is not even close to you.  Rene says to Bruno that he leaves me re mortals – us mere mortals the dust, he is much better than the rest of us.

Bruno says, “I’m leaving.  I know you love giving m e a hard time.”  “To give (someone) a hard time” means to criticize someone, usually by making fun of them.  Bruno says, “remember this: I give as good a s I get.”  The expression “to give as good as you get” means I can criticize joki ngly, I can tease (tease) you

just as much as you tease me – as you make fun of m e, as you criticize me. “And,” Bruno says, “I have a long memory!”  “To hav e a long memory” means that you will remember things for a long time.  Wiv es have very long memories, they will remember things that you said and did yea rs and years ago.  All husbands know this!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rene:  Hey, look who’s here.  It’s the company’s go lden boy.

Bruno:  Very funny.

Rene:  I’m not joking.  First, you’re recognized at  the annual meeting for your work in the company, and then you get a commendatio n from the city for your volunteer work.  I’m basking in your reflected glor y.

Bruno:  I didn’t ask for either honor, as you well know.  I’m not a glory hound.

Rene:  Yes, and that’s what makes it even more gall ing.  You don’t have to go seeking your glory; it comes to you.

Bruno:  Knock it off!  I like praise as much as the  next guy, but I’d rather not be in the limelight.

Rene:  I know.  You’re exceptional and you’re modes t about it.  You’re the perfect guy.  You leave us mere mortals in the dust.

Bruno:  I’m leaving.  I know you love giving me a h ard time, but remember this: I give as good as I get – and I have a long memory!

# Supplies for Outdoor Recreation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 777: Supplies for Outdoor Recreation.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 777 – or backwards, 777.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, C alifornia.

This episode is a dialogue between Jim and Fumiko a bout spending time outside having fun.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jim:  I shouldn’t have let my brother pack my suppl ies for this trip.  I was running late and he offered to do it.

Fumiko:  What’s the problem?

Jim:  He doesn’t know the first thing about hiking or camping.  Look at this!  My backpack is filled with bottles of water!

Fumiko:  What’s wrong with that?

Jim:  He should have just packed me a water filter,  instead of all these heavy bottles to lug around.  And he forgot some of the m ost important supplies, like bug spray and a flashlight.

Fumiko:  You’re welcome to borrow any of our suppli es.  Here’s some bug spray. Do you need matches?

Jim:  Yeah, I do.  My brother packed matches, but n ot in a waterproof bag.  One of the bottles of water leaked and got them all wet .  At least my tent and cook stove were spared.

Fumiko:  Maybe your brother is telling you somethin g.

Jim:  What?

 Fumiko:  Maybe he wants to be included in your camp ing trips.  Then, he’ll learn what to do and what to bring.

Jim:  You might have something there.

[end of dialogue]

Jim begins by saying, “I shouldn’t have (I should n ot have) let (or allowed) my brother pack my supplies for this trip.”  “Supplies ” are things that you need for some particular purpose.  It’s a very general term;  it can be used when talking about making something: we need certain materials –  certain things.  In this case, it’s about going on a trip, where you need to  bring certain things.  Jim says, “I was running late (meaning I was behind schedule)  and he offered to do it.”  So his brother – Jim’s brother – packed Jim’s supplies .  He put them all in a bag or in some suitcase for Jim to take with him.

Fumiko says, “What’s the problem?”  Jim says, “He ( my brother) doesn’t know the first thing about hiking or camping.”  When we say someone “doesn’t know the first thing about something” we mean they don’t  know anything; they have no knowledge at all about this topic – this subject.  In this case, it’s about hiking and camping.  “Hiking” (hiking) is when you go out and walk in a forest or on a mountain or by a lake, some area outside of perhaps  the city or in a park inside a city.  “To hike” is the verb; “hiking” is the noun.   “Camping” is when you go and you sleep away from your house outside – outdoors, not in a hotel.  That’s where I’ll be!  But you can be camping; that’s fine.  I’m  not a camper, I’m not really someone who likes to sleep outside, but some people  do and so that’s why we have this strange thing called “camping.”

So Jim then says, “Look at this!  My backpack is fi lled with bottles of water!” Your “backpack” is a large bag that you wear on you r back, and you put things in there that you will need for your camping trip or y our hiking.  In the United States, it’s very common in colleges and universities for s tudents to carry their books in backpacks.  This is different than what happens in other countries.  In other countries, only little children wear backpacks, but  in the United States it’s very common for college students to wear backpacks with all of their books and everything.  So, Jim has a backpack, not for books but to go camping.

Fumiko says, “What’s wrong with (filling your backp ack with bottles of water)?” Jim says, “He should have just packed me a water fi lter, instead of all these heavy bottles to lug around.”  A “water filter” is a small device that you put inside a water bottle that cleans the water so you can dri nk it, so you can use the water

that is outside – out in the park, or wherever you are – and the water filter will clean it.  That way, if you want clean water, you d on’t have to bring all of the bottles of water with you; you don’t have to lug the bottles around.  “To lug” (lug) is to carry something that is very heavy, very diff icult to move.  “Lug around” just means to move from one place to another

Jim said his brother also forgot some of the most i mportant supplies, like bug spray and a flashlight.  “Bug (bug) spray (spray)” is a liquid you put on your skin to prevent or stop little mosquitoes and bugs from biting you.  A “flashlight” (flashlight – one word) is a small, portable light;  usually it has batteries.  Here in the U.S., a common kind of flashlight is a long tub e, usually 6 to 12 inches, and there’s a light at the end of it, but it could be of a different shape, certainly.  So, Jim’s brother didn’t put a flashlight into his back pack for this trip.

Fumiko says, “You’re welcome to borrow any of our s upplies.”  “You’re welcome” is usually what you say when someone says “thank yo u” to you.  But in the expression “you’re welcome to (do something),” “you ’re welcome to use my matches,” that means that I don’t mind, I would be happy to share my matches with you; you can use them if you want.  “Matches” are usually small, little sticks of wood or paper that have a special chemical on th em that when you move the match against another surface it creates a flame – it causes a fire.  Of course, if you don’t have matches, then you just go eat in a r estaurant, and you don’t have to worry about lighting a fire!

Well, Fumiko says that Jim is welcome to borrow any  of their supplies, she says, “Here’s some bug spray,” then asks him if he needs matches.  Jim says, “Yeah (or yes), I do.”  He says his brother packed matche s, but not in a waterproof bag. Something that is “waterproof” (one word) does not allow water inside of that container or that thing.  So, if a bag is waterproo f, you could put it in the water or you could have rain fall on it and what is inside of the bag would not get wet.  It prevents the water for going inside.  Jim says, “On e of the bottles of water (that were in his backpack) leaked.”  In other words, the  water came out of the bottle by accident, and that got all of the matches wet.  “At least my tent and cook stove were spared,” he says.  Your “tent” is a small thin g that you use to sleep in; it is usually made of a thin material and you use poles o r sticks to put it up.  It’s like a little house that you build, where you can put your self into and your supplies into when you are outside – when you are camping.  A “co ok stove” is a small thing you use to cook on when you are outside; you can co ok food on one of these little stoves.  The stove usually is powered by or has gas to produce the fire for the heat.  Jim says that his tent and cook stove we re spared.  “To be spared” (spared) means they were not hurt or harmed or affe cted by, in this case, the

water.  “Spare” has a number of meanings in English ; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.

Fumiko says, “Maybe your brother is telling you som ething.”  She means maybe his brother is trying to communicate some message t o him by the way that he packed his supplies.  Jim says, “What?”  Fumiko say s, “Maybe (your brother) wants to be included in your camping trips.  Then, he’ll learn what to do and what to bring.”  Jim says, “You might have something the re.”  The expression “you might have something there” is used to show that yo u believe what the other person said is correct, or at least is partially co rrect.  Maybe you don’t agree with everything, but most of what they say, or part of w hat they say is correct, is something you agree with.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jim:  I shouldn’t have let my brother pack my suppl ies for this trip.  I was running late and he offered to do it.

Fumiko:  What’s the problem?

Jim:  He doesn’t know the first thing about hiking or camping.  Look at this!  My backpack is filled with bottles of water!

Fumiko:  What’s wrong with that?

Jim:  He should have just packed me a water filter,  instead of all these heavy bottles to lug around.  And he forgot some of the m ost important supplies, like bug spray and a flashlight.

Our scriptwriter might not know the first thing abo ut camping, but she does know a lot about writing good scripts.  Thank you, Dr. L ucy Tse.





# Getting Your Pocket Picked

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 778: Getting Your Pocket Picked.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 778.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this very episode.  You’ll be able to understand everything w e are saying because you’ll have a complete transcript of this episode when you  download the Learning Guide.

This episode is called “Getting Your Pocket Picked, ” it’s when somebody steals something from you, usually your wallet.  Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Lenny:  Wait a second.  Where’s my wallet?

Anita:  It’s not in your back pocket?

Lenny:  No, it’s in none of my pockets.  My pocket’ s been picked!

Anita:  It must have happened when our attention wa s diverted by those boys fighting over there.

Lenny:  I should have been paying more attention in  a busy market like this.  I felt someone bump me from behind, but it never occurred to me that someone could be lifting my wallet.

Anita:  I’ve been clutching my purse, worried about  purse-snatchers.  I never thought anyone would be able to pick your pocket.

Lenny:  Me, neither.  I don’t know how I’m going to  live this down.  When the boys hear about this…

Anita:  Come on, we’d better go file a police repor t.  You never know.  Maybe your wallet will turn up.

Lenny:  Fat chance of that happening.  This is real ly embarrassing…

 Anita:  Stop stalling.  If there’s one thing I’ve l earned after being a cop’s wife for 15 years is that you’ve got to face the music.

[end of dialogue]

Lenny begins by saying, “Wait a second (meaning hol d on; stop).  Where’s my wallet?”  Your “wallet” (wallet) is usually a folde d piece of leather that you use to carry money and credit cards in.  Lenny says, “Wher e’s my wallet?”  He can’t find his wallet.  Anita says, “It’s not in your back poc ket?”  When you’re wearing pants you have usually pockets that you can put things in to, that’s where put my wallet, where most men put their wallets.  Lenny says, “No,  it’s in none of my pockets (meaning I don’t have it in any of my pockets).  My  pocket’s been picked!”  To “pick (pick) (someone’s) pocket (pocket)” means to steal someone’s wallet, usually from their pocket.  And, if you have ever b een on a subway in a large city, or just been in a crowded place where there are lot s of people, especially lots of tourists, you may have had this happen to you, wher e someone takes your wallet from your pocket without you knowing it.

This happened to me once, many years ago, 20-25 yea rs ago.  I was on a small bus in Mexico, and it was very crowded, which was n ot unusual, and I was very stupid and young, and I had my wallet in my back po cket.  And, it happened so quickly, two people had come on, and one stood in f ront and once stood behind me.  Then they got off the bus and I realized that they had taken my wallet.  So, I learned a lesson there, as you should learn a lesso n; if you haven’t had that happen, make sure you never put your wallet in your  pocket, especially in a busy place.  I keep my wallet in my pocket normally, but  when I ever go to a crowded place, including here in Los Angeles, I’m much more  careful about that.

Well, Lenny was not careful, and he had his pocket picked.  Anita says, “It must have happened when our attention was diverted by th ose boys fighting over there.”  “To divert” (divert) means to change the d irection of something; in this case, change the direction of your attention, “to d istract you,” we might say.  So, there were two boys fighting, and they were looking  at the boys fighting and weren’t paying attention.  Lenny says, “I should ha ve been paying more attention (I should have been more alert) in a busy market li ke this.”  A “market” is a place where you buy and sell things, where there are ofte n a lot of people.  That’s what Lenny means when he says it’s “busy” (busy), there are a lot of people there. Lenny says, “I felt someone bump me from behind.”  “To bump” (bump) means to hit something, not hard, usually by accident, often  with your body or some part of your body.  What happens, of course, is that the pe ople who pick your pockets – we call them “pickpockets,” that’s the person who d oes this.  Pickpockets will

often hit you slightly from behind, and that’s when  they actually take the wallet out of your pocket, because you can’t feel them doi ng it while they’re doing it. Anyway, I’m not trying to give you instructions on how to be a pickpocket!

Well, Lenny says that someone bumped him from behin d.  By the way, “bump” is the word that has other meanings in English as well ; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.  Lenny says, “it never occurred to  me,” meaning I was surprised that it happened; I wasn’t thinking about it; it ne ver was an idea that I had.  “It never occurred to me that someone could be lifting my wallet.”  So he didn’t realize, when this happened, that someone might be lifting his wallet.  “To lift” (lift) usually means to pick up something heavy in order to carry it or move it off of the ground.  Here, however, “to lift” means to stea l, to rob, especially when you are taking something out of someone’s wallet or som eone’s coat by hitting them or bumping them so they don’t realize you are steal ing it.  You could also use it just as a general verb meaning “to steal” as well.

Anita says, “I’ve been clutching my purse.”  “To cl utch” (clutch) means to hold something very tightly and very close to your body.   So women, who often carry their wallets in their purses will, if they’re smar t, clutch their purses close to them – hold it close to them, especially on a subway for  example, so that you don’t have someone coming and stealing your purse.  Someo ne who steals purses from women is called a “purse-snatcher.”  A “purse”  (purse) is a small bag, that’s what women often carry.  “To snatch” (snatch) means  to take quickly from someone.  So, a purse-snatcher will often be runnin g down a street, perhaps, and grab a woman’s purse and take it from her – sna tch it from her – and run away.  It could be that the purse-snatcher is on a motorcycle, and comes around and takes the purse and goes away.  I saw that in a  movie recently – a very good movie, Argentinean movie called Nine Queens .  It was very, very entertaining, very interesting.  Anyway, an old movie, 1990 I thi nk.  You can find it on the Internet somewhere perhaps.

Anita says, “I never thought anyone would be able t o pick your pocket.”  Lenny says, “Me, neither.”  Notice he says, “me, neither, ” not “I, neither.”  “Me” is grammatically incorrect, but that’s how people talk ; they say, “me, neither” in informal conversation.  Lenny says, “I don’t know h ow I’m going to live this down.”  “To live (something) down” is when somethin g bad happens to you or embarrassing happens to you, and everyone makes fun  of you – everyone laughs at you.  You try to keep your pride – your d ignity, you try not to be embarrassed but it’s difficult because of this emba rrassing thing, this thing you did.  That’s what it means to live something down.  Lenny says, “When the boys hear about this,” the boys are probably his friends .

Anita says, “Come on, we’d better go file a police report.”  “To file” means to officially submit or give a document or piece of pa per usually to a government office.  A “police report” is when you go to a poli ce officer – a cop – and say that there was a crime, and the officer writes up a piec e of paper.  That piece of paper is called a “police report.”  Anita says, “You neve r know.  Maybe your wallet will turn up.”  “To turn up” is a two-word phrasal verb that here means when something is lost it suddenly is found, it suddenly  appears.  “It will turn up” means we will find it eventually, even though it is lost now.  Lenny doesn’t think this is possible; he says, “Fat chance of that happening.”  The phrase “fat (fat) chance” means you don’t think it’s possible; it’s impossibl e.  It’s an informal way of saying that: something is impossible.  “Are you going to w in the lottery?”  “Fat chance,” meaning almost certainly not.  Am I going to win an  award for my singing?  Fat chance.

Lenny says, “This is really embarrassing.”  Anita s ays, “Stop stalling.”  “To stall” (stall) means to delay in doing something, to avoid  doing something until later. Anita says, “Stop stalling.  If there’s one thing I ’ve learned about being a cop’s wife for 15 years is that you’ve got to face the mu sic.”  A “cop” is a police officer, as I mentioned earlier.  The expression “to face the music” means to accept the consequences of your actions, to accept reality.  W hen something bad happens, you can’t just hide from it, you have do accept it,  you have to do something about it or at least to realize that it is happening, not  to avoid it.  Anita and Lenny are married, so when Anita says she’s been a cop’s wife  for 15 years, she means that Lenny is a police officer.  So he was a police  officer who got pick pocketed. This is somewhat embarrassing, that’s why Lenny say s, “When the boys hear about this.”  The “boys,” then, refer to the other police officers – the other cops, male cops – that he works with.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lenny:  Wait a second.  Where’s my wallet?

Anita:  It’s not in your back pocket?

Lenny:  No, it’s in none of my pockets.  My pocket’ s been picked!

Anita:  It must have happened when our attention wa s diverted by those boys fighting over there.

Lenny:  I should have been paying more attention in  a busy market like this.  I felt someone bump me from behind, but it never occurred to me that someone could be lifting my wallet.

Anita:  I’ve been clutching my purse, worried about  purse-snatchers.  I never thought anyone would be able to pick your pocket.

Lenny:  Me, neither.  I don’t know how I’m going to  live this down.  When the boys hear about this…

Anita:  Come on, we’d better go file a police repor t.  You never know.  Maybe your wallet will turn up.

Lenny:  Fat chance of that happening.  This is real ly embarrassing…

Anita:  Stop stalling.  If there’s one thing I’ve l earned after being a cop’s wife for 15 years is that you’ve got to face the music.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 780: Being Sued.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 780.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  How are you tod ay?  Me?  Pretty good; thank you for asking.

This episode is about being “sued,” when you do som ething wrong and someone else wants you to pay money for it.  Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Ally:  Hello, Ally McNeal.

Jerry:  Ally, this is Jerry Mason.  I need to talk to you right away.  We’re being sued and we’ve just been served.  This is one of th ose times I wish we had in- house counsel.

Ally:  Jerry, you know that our firm will do its be st to represent you, as we’ve done in the past.  You can count on me and all of t he attorneys in this office. How about if I come to your office this afternoon a nd we can discuss it?

Jerry:  Okay, that’s great.

Ally:  In the meantime, can you give me a brief run down?

Jerry:  Yeah, we’re being sued for negligence.  In fact, it’s a class action suit against our company

Ally:  All right.  Can you fax or email me the pape rs so I can see what they’re alleging?

Jerry:  Yes, I can do that.  We really need your he lp with this, Ally.  A lawsuit like this could ruin a company like ours.

Ally:  Don’t panic.  We’ll take a look at it and se e if there’s any merit in the case. It might just be a frivolous lawsuit.

Jerry:  If they have a case, you’ll have to find a loophole to get us out of this, or negotiate a settlement.  The last thing I want is t o go to court.

Ally:  Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  We’ll dis cuss it this afternoon.  And Jerry?

Jerry:  Yeah?

Ally:  In the meantime, try to lay off the coffee.

[end of dialogue]

Our phone conversation begins with Ally answering t he phone, and like a lot of people do in a professional situation they answer b y saying, “Hello,” and then their name or the name of their company.  So Ally s ays, “Hello, Ally McNeal,” and the other person says, “Ally, this is Jerry Mason.  I need to talk to you right away (right now).”  He says, “We’re being sued.”  “To su e (sue) (someone)” as a verb means to go to the court, to go to a judge and say that this person did something wrong and they owe you money, they should pay you m oney for something they did wrong to you.  They hurt you or damaged you or your company in some way. Not physically damaged, although it could be that, but it could also just be some sort of financial loss, money that you lost because  of something they did.  Jerry says that their company is being sued and we’ve jus t been served.  “To be served” in this case means to receive legal papers from the court notifying you – telling you that you are being served or that you m ust take some sort of legal action.  Jerry says, “This is one of those times (o ne of those instances or situations) I wish we had in-house counsel.”  “Coun sel” (counsel) means a lawyer, an attorney, someone who is knowledgeable a bout the law.  “In-house” (in-house) means working for your company.  Some co mpanies are big, and they have their own lawyers and their own accountants.  Smaller companies usually don’t, so they don’t have a lawyer in-house, inside  of the company, who works full time, permanently for the company.

Ally says, “Jerry, you know that our firm will do its best to represent you.”  So now we understand that Ally is someone who works for a company of lawyers – a group of lawyers.  We call a group of lawyers “a gr oup of thieves.”  No, I’m just kidding!  We call a group of lawyers a “firm” (firm ).  The law firm is a group of lawyers who work together.  So Ally says that her f irm will do its best to represent you.  “To represent (someone)” in this case means t o be their official

representative.  Really, here it just means to be t heir lawyer, to be their attorney, to be the person that will give them legal advice.  Ally says, “You can count on me (you can rely on me or depend on me) and all of the attorneys in this office.” “Attorney” (attorney) is just another word for a la wyer, a little more formal word perhaps, but they mean the exact same thing.  Ally says, “How about if I come to your office this afternoon and we can discuss it?”  What do you think of that idea, “how about if…?”

Jerry says, “Okay, that’s great.”  Ally says, “In t he meantime (meaning until that happens), can you give me a brief rundown?”  A “run down” (rundown – one word) is a brief summary; a short summary or descri ption of what happened, of some problem or some event.  Jerry says, “Yeah, we’ re being sued for negligence.”  “Negligence” (negligence) is when you ’re not careful, when you don’t do what you are supposed to do and then someo ne gets hurt because of it. So, if you’re a company and you have a door that’s broken and if you open it you could hurt yourself.  So, someone comes to your bui lding and they open your door and they hurt themselves, they might sue you f or negligence.  You should have been more careful; you should have taken care of the problem.  Jerry says his company is being sued for negligence; it’s a cl ass action suit.  A “suit” (suit) is the legal action of suing someone.  The term “class  action” usually involves a court case with more than one person, usually a who le group of people who are suing you.  Often, it can be an entire category of customers.  So, some customers are mad about the way Starbucks serves it s coffee, so they file a class action lawsuit – a class action suit.  They’r e representing all of the customers of Starbucks, that’s the idea.

Ally says, “All right.  Can you fax or email the pa pers so I can see what they’re alleging?”  “To allege” (allege) is to say that som eone else did something wrong, to accuse someone else of doing something illegal o r wrong.  Jerry says, “Yes, I can do that (I can email you the papers).  We reall y need your help with this, Ally. A lawsuit like this could ruin a company like ours. ”  A “lawsuit,” again, is just another word for a “suit,” which is the legal actio n that someone takes against you.  When someone sues you, we say they have “file d a lawsuit.”

Ally says, “Don’t panic.  We’ll take a look at it a nd see if there’s any merit in the case.”  “Merit” (merit) is whether it’s of any valu e, if it’s worth anything, if it’s true. The word “merit” can also mean excellence, being go od at something, or some accomplishment.  Ally says, “It might just be a fri volous lawsuit.”  Something that is “frivolous” (frivolous) is not serious, somethin g that someone does but there isn’t a good reason to do it.  A frivolous lawsuit would be someone suing you over something that isn’t true or isn’t very import ant.

Jerry says, “If they have a case (meaning if they m ight have some merit to their argument), you’ll have to find a loophole to get us  out of this.”  A “loophole” (loophole – one word) is a part of the law that is poorly written or it’s not very exact, it’s not very precise so that people can fin d a way to not break the law by finding some exception to law, by finding some vagu eness or some imprecision in the law that allows them to still do something l egally.  Jerry says if there is a case here Ally and her law firm need to find a loop hole, or, if they don’t, to negotiate a settlement.  A “settlement” is when a c ompany agrees usually to pay the person who is suing them some money.  They say,  “Okay, we won’t go to the judge, we won’t have a legal case, we’ll just pay y ou some money and then you’ll sign a paper saying, ‘I’m not going to sue you anym ore.’”  Jerry says, “The last thing I want is to go to court.”  That means I don’ t want to have a trial, I don’t want to go to a judge.

Ally says, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”  “To  get ahead of yourself” means to start planning or doing something before you sho uld, before you really know what you’re doing, or before you know you should be  doing it.  I have a friend who wants to get his driver’s license.  And even be fore he got his driver’s license, he went out and he was looking at cars to buy, and I told him, “Don’t get ahead of yourself,” meaning you can’t buy a car until you ge t your driver’s license, so don’t worry about that; start doing the things you should  be doing about getting your driver’s license.  That’s getting ahead of yourself .

Ally says, “Jerry?” and Jerry says, “Yeah?”  Ally s ays, “try to lay off the coffee.” “To lay off” (lay off) is a two-word phrasal verb m eaning to reduce the frequency or amount of something, to do something less.  “To lay off (something)” is to do less of it, in this case to drink less coffee becau se Jerry’s getting all excited, and when you drink coffee you get more caffeine, which can get you more excited than you should be.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ally:  Hello, Ally McNeal.

Jerry:  Ally, this is Jerry Mason.  I need to talk to you right away.  We’re being sued and we’ve just been served.  This is one of th ose times I wish we had in- house counsel.

# Filming a TV Show or Movie

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 781: Filming a TV Show or Movie.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 781.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is about making a television show or m ovie.  Sounds exciting!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Martin:  Okay, quiet on the set!  What are the extr as doing over there?  They’re not in the scene.

Stephanie:  Sorry, I’ll get them off the set.  Is t his the lighting you wanted for this scene?  If not, I can tell the lighting crew.

Martin:  The lighting is fine, but this staging is all wrong.  And can somebody turn off those sound effects?  We’re not using them in t his scene.

Stephanie:  I’ll get right on that.

Martin:  Where is the cast?

Stephanie:  They’re on break because they thought w e wouldn’t resume shooting until 2:00.

Martin:  That’s great!  I have no cast, the sets are all wrong, I have extras milling around where they shouldn’t be, and where is my scr ipt?

Stephanie:  It’s right here on your chair.  Are you  sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?

Martin:  I wish I had that luxury.  Time is money a nd we’re already way over budget.  I’ll be lucky if I still have the shirt on  my back when this production is over!

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Martin saying, “Okay, quie t on the set!”  The “set” (set) is the area where you are making a video or a film or a television show; it’s the area where the actors are standing, what you’re act ually filming.  “Quiet on the set” is a common expression the “director” of the f ilm or the TV show, the person who is in charge of actually making it, says so tha t everyone is quiet when they start filming so that you don’t hear other people t alking when you’re not supposed to.

Martin says, “What are the extras doing over there? ”  An “extra” (extra) is a person who appears in a movie or a TV show, but doe sn’t say anything usually, doesn’t have any what we would call “speaking parts .”  They don’t actually say anything; they’re just there perhaps as part of a c rowd of people.  Here in Los Angeles, there are lots of companies that have extr as, and you can sign up and work as an extra in a movie.  It’s very boring work , I’ve been told, and it doesn’t pay very well.  I know a few people who have done t hat because they needed the money.  Well, a lot of actors try to get their “sta rt,” their beginning in acting, by being an extra, one of these people that just appea r on the screen – that is, in the movie or in the TV show – even though they don’t say anything and you don’t even know who they are.

Martin says that the extras are not in the scene.  The “scene” (scene) is the part of the movie – it could also be talking about a pla y – that shows action in a single place.  So, a movie usually has several different s cenes – several different places that you see the actors and the actresses.  There are a few movies that don’t have more than one or two scenes.  There was a famous movie several years ago called My Dinner with Andre , where the whole movie was just basically two people talking in a restaurant.  Well, most mov ies have several scenes.

Stephanie says, “Sorry, I’ll get them (I’ll get the  extras) off the set,” meaning so that they are no longer where the cameras are filmi ng.  She says, “Is this the lighting you wanted for this scene?  If not, I can tell the lighting crew.”  The “lighting” is the arrangement of the lights on a st age or on a set that allows you, of course, to see the actors.  Especially if you are inside, you need to be able to have lighting so that you can see what’s going on.  The word “crew” (crew) is a general term for a group of people who are working together, usually doing some sort of physical work.  In a movie or a TV show, a “crew” is a group of people who do all of the technical things, not the actors,  not the director, but the people who do the lighting, who actually operate the camer as, and so forth.  This is the crew.

 Martin says, “The lighting is fine, but this stagin g is all wrong.”  “Staging” (staging) is the plan for where the actors are goin g to stand, how they should move around in a particular scene.  By the way, I s hould mention the word “crew,” which we just talked about, has some additi onal meanings as well; those can be found in our Learning Guide.  Martin says, “ can someone turn off those sound effects?”  “Sound effects” are recorded sound s that are added so that you don’t actually have to have a certain thing there.  For example, when we record one of our podcasts and you hear a telephone ringin g at the beginning of the dialogue, that’s a sound effect.  I don’t actually have a telephone here that I make ring; I have a recording of a telephone and I use t hat.  That’s a sound effect. Martin says that they’re not using sound effects in  this scene – in this part of the movie.

Stephanie says, “I’ll get right on that.”  “To get right on (something)” means to do it immediately, to do it right away.  Martin then s ays, “Where is the cast?”  The “cast” (cast) is the group of actors in the movie, everyone who is supposed to be in the movie or in the television show.  They are t he people who are the main actors, not the extras.  Typically, we talk about t he cast, we’re talking about the people who are actually speaking in the movies.  Un less, of course, it’s a silent movie!

Stephanie says the cast is “on break,” they’re taki ng some time to relax, “because they thought we wouldn’t resume shooting u ntil 2:00.”  “To shoot” (shoot) here means to use a camera to record images , to record something with a camera, usually a movie camera.  Sometimes we’ll talk about a shoot related to taking photographs, especially, for example, for a magazine.  If they are models, we might have a shoot.  But here, we’re talking abo ut filming the TV show or the movie.

Martin says, “That’s great!”  But he is not happy w hen he says, “That’s great,” he’s being sarcastic; he’s saying one thing and mea ning another.  He says, “I have no cast, the sets are all wrong, I have extras  milling around where they shouldn’t be, and where is my script?”  Martin says  he has extras milling around. “To mill (mill) around” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to sort of walk around slowly in an area without any reason or without any  particular purpose.  You’re just waiting for something so you’re sort of standi ng, we might say “standing around,” milling around, moving back and forth beca use you don’t have anything else to do.  Martin asks where his script is.  The “script” (script) is the written plan for the play, the TV show, or the movie that tells you what all the actors say and what they do.

Stephanie says, “It’s right here on your chair.  are you sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?”  “To call  it a day” means to stop doing something, to stop working for that day and not to work again until the next day. So maybe you’ve been working very hard in your offi ce, and at 4:00 in the afternoon you say, “I’m going to call it a day.”  I ’m going to stop working now and resume or continue working tomorrow.

Martin says, “I wish I had that luxury,” the luxury  to call it a day.  “Luxury” (luxury) here means something very nice, something pleasant,  something good and pleasurable.  But Martin says he does not have that  luxury; he cannot afford – he doesn’t have the ability to just stop working for t he day.  He says, “Time is money.”  This is an old expression.  “Time is money ” means that you can’t waste your time.  We have to be productive, if we sit aro und and do nothing we’ll be losing money because we’re not taking advantage of the time we have.

“Time is money,” Martin says, “and we’re already wa y over budget.”  “To be way over” means to have spent too much money, or to be more than something.  In this case, they are over budget.  “Budget” (budget)  is the plan for the amount of money you are going to spend on something.  If you are “over budget,” you’re spending more than you planned.  If you are “under budget,” you are spending less than you planned.

Martin says, “I’ll be lucky if I still have the shi rt on my back when this production is over!”  The expression “the shirt on my back” do esn’t mean the actual shirt you are wearing.  It’s a phrase referring to the most t hat you can lose, the maximum amount of money that you might lose.  Of course if you lose all of your money, you may actually lose your clothes; you may have to  sell your clothes to pay the money that you owe someone else.  That’s kind of wh at Martin is saying.  A “production” (production) is usually the word we us e to describe the entire action of making a movie, a play, or a television show.  T he whole activity – the whole thing is called a “production.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Martin:  Okay, quiet on the set!  What are the extr as doing over there?  They’re not in this scene.

Stephanie:  Sorry, I’ll get them off the set.  Is t his the lighting you wanted for this scene?  If not, I can tell the lighting crew.

Martin:  The lighting is fine, but this staging is all wrong.  And can somebody turn off those sound effects?  We’re not using them in t his scene.

Stephanie:  I’ll get right on that.

Martin:  Where is the cast?

Stephanie:  They’re on break because they thought w e wouldn’t resume shooting until 2:00.

Martin:  That’s great!  I have no cast, the sets are all wrong, I have extras milling around where they shouldn’t be, and where’s my scri pt?

Stephanie:  It’s right here on your chair.  Are you  sure you don’t want to call it a day and start again in the morning?

Martin:  I wish I had that luxury.  Time is money a nd we’re already way over budget.  I’ll be lucky if I still have the shirt on  my back when this production is over!

# Expressing Bitter Feelings

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 782: Expressing Bitter Feelings.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 782.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to eslpod.com today, and become a member of ESL Podcast.  You can download a Learning Guide for this episode, and all  of our current episodes if and when you do.

This episode is a dialogue about “bitter feelings,”  about being angry at someone else.  Sounds like fun!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Laurent:  I’m done with women!  They’re liars and m anipulators.

Julie:  Let me guess.  You’ve had a bad breakup?

Laurent:  It wasn’t just bad.  It was monumentally awful.  I’m never going to date again.

Julie:  You’re just feeling bitter right now, but y ou’ll get over it.  You won’t always feel so jaded.  Wait a second.  Did you break up wi th Brittany?

Laurent:  Yeah, I’ve told you about her before.

Julie:  I remember.  Don’t you guys have an on-agai n, off-again relationship?  I mean haven’t you guys broken up before?

Laurent:  Yeah, but this was the absolute end.  We’ re not getting back together.

Julie:  But didn’t you say that three months ago?  Maybe there’s still a chance for reconciliation.

Laurent:  Absolutely not!  Brittany walked all over  me and didn’t care one iota about my feelings.  I’ll never talk to her again.  As far as I’m concerned, she’s persona non grata!

[Phone rings]

Julie:  Hello.  Oh hi, Brittany.  Yes, he’s here.  It’s Brittany and she wants to talk to you.  Do you want to talk to her?

Laurent:  Yes…no…yes!  Oh, give me that phone!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Laurent – his name is Fren ch, I know I have a terrible French accent – Laurent says, “I’m done with women! ”  “To be done with (something or someone)” means you don’t want to be involved or have anything to do with that thing, or in this case, people.  La urent says he’s done with women, “They’re liars and manipulators.”  “To lie” means n ot to tell truth.  “To be a liar” (liar) is to be a person who does not tell the trut h.  Laurent thinks that women are liars and manipulators.  A “manipulator” is someone  who manipulates.  “To manipulate” means to control another person by tric king or fooling them.  It’s not an obvious sort of thing; it’s what we might call a  “subtle” thing.  “To manipulate (someone)” is to get them to do something for you t hat you want done.  A “manipulator” would be a person who manipulates oth er people.

So women are liars and manipulators, at least that’ s what Laurent thinks.  Julie says, “Let me guess.  You’ve had (or you have had) a bad breakup?”  A “breakup” (one word) is when a romantic relationshi p ends, when two people decide they are not going to be romantically involv ed with each other anymore. How sad.  Poor Laurent!  He says, “It wasn’t just b ad.  It was monumentally awful.”  He’s saying it was worse than bad.  “Awful ” is the same as terrible, very bad.  “Monumentally” is here used to mean extremely , in a big way, or simply very much.  He says, “I’m never going to date again .”  And Julie says, “You’re just feeling bitter right now, but you’ll get over it.”  “Bitter” (bitter) here means feeling that something was unfair or something was wrong.  Perhaps someone did something wrong to you or you were hurt in some  way, and now you don’t want to forgive the other person.  You don’t want t o forget how hurt you were. “Bitter” has some other meanings in English as well ; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.

Julie says that Laurent is just feeling bitter, but  he’ll get over it.  “To get over (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to no longer  be mad or upset over something, to recover, to feel better, and no longe r be so angry.  Julie says, “You won’t always feel so jaded.”  “Jaded” (jaded) usual ly is when you have a lot of experience with something and it no longer interest s you, it bores you, you’re no longer enthusiastic about it.  I’m not sure if that ’s Laurent’s problem; I’m not sure

if that’s the right word to describe how he’s feeli ng.  Julie, I think, means that he’s feeling depressed, which I suppose could be related  to being jaded.

Anyway, Julie says, “Wait a second.  Did you break up with Brittany?”  Laurent says, “Yes, I’ve told you about her before.”  Julie  says, “I remember.  Don’t you guys have an on-again, off-again relationship?”  “O n-again, off-again” means that sometimes you do it and sometimes you don’t.  That is, sometimes you, perhaps, are girlfriend and boyfriend, and then other times you’re not.  A “relationship” is obviously an association or connection or involveme nt with another person.  So, an on-again, off-again relationship would be one wh ere you are romantically involved, and then you breakup, and then you get ba ck together again, and so forth.  Julie says, “I mean haven’t you guys broken  up before?”

Laurent says, “Yeah, but this was the absolute end. ”  “Absolute” (absolute) here means definite or definitive, without any doubt, wi thout any question.  This is the end, that’s what Laurent is saying.  He says, “We’r e not getting back together.” “To get back together with (someone)” would be to e nd a romantic relationship, to have a breakup, and then to start the romantic r elationship again two months later or a week later or whenever.

So Laurent says that he and Brittany are not going to get back together again, but Julie says, “But didn’t you say that three mont hs ago?” meaning you’ve promised before that you weren’t going to get back together again.  “Maybe there’s still a chance for reconciliation.”  “Recon ciliation” is when two people, or two organizations even, have some sort of disagreem ent and separation. “Reconciliation” tries to bring them back together again, usually it’s in a romantic relationship.

Laurent says, “Absolutely not (no)!  Brittany walke d all over me and didn’t care one iota about my feelings.”  “To walk all over (so meone)” is to take advantage of another person, to use the other person for what yo u want and not care about that person.  Well, Laurent says that Brittany walk ed all over him and didn’t care one iota about his feelings.  “Iota” (iota) is a ve ry small amount of something; here, it means almost nothing.  She didn’t care at all about his feelings.  He says, “I’ll never talk to her again.  As far as I’m conce rned, she’s persona non grata!” “Persona non grata” is a Latin expression; it means  that person is not welcome here.  You will not talk to them, you will not let them in your house, you don’t want them in any way.

Then, suddenly, the phone rings, and Julie answers the phone.  She says, “Hello. Oh hi, Brittany.”  Brittany is calling on the telep hone.  Julie then says, “Yes, he’s here,” because Brittany has asked Julie if Laurent is here.  Julie then says to

Laurent, “It’s Brittany and she wants to talk to yo u.  Do you want to talk to her?” Of course, we know that he just said he didn’t want  to talk to her anymore, but of course he says yes.  “Yes…no…yes!” he says, “Oh, gi ve me that phone!”  Let me talk to her on the phone.

So, that’s what happens to some men.  They never le arn their lesson, and they continue to go back and back and back again.  Of co urse, maybe Laurent is in love, or maybe he’s just not very intelligent.  Som etimes love can make you stupid!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Laurent:  I’m done with women!  They’re liars and m anipulators.

Julie:  Let me guess.  You’ve had a bad breakup?

Laurent:  It wasn’t just bad.  It was monumentally awful.  I’m never going to date again.

Julie:  You’re just feeling bitter right now, but y ou’ll get over it.  You won’t always feel so jaded.  Wait a second.  Did you break up wi th Brittany?

Laurent:  Yeah, I’ve told you about her before.

Julie:  I remember.  Don’t you guys have an on-agai n, off-again relationship?  I mean haven’t you guys broken up before?

Laurent:  Yeah, but this was the absolute end.  We’ re not getting back together.

Julie:  But didn’t you say that three months ago?  Maybe there’s still a chance for reconciliation.

Laurent:  Absolutely not!  Brittany walked all over  me and didn’t care one iota about my feelings.  I’ll never talk to her again.  As far as I’m concerned, she’s persona non grata!

[Phone rings]

Julie:  Hello.  Oh hi, Brittany.  Yes, he’s here.  It’s Brittany and she wants to talk to you.  Do you want to talk to her?

 Laurent:  Yes…no…yes!  Oh, give me that phone!

[end of dialogue]

She’s the absolute best scriptwriter on the Interne t.  I’m speaking, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.

This episode is a dialogue between Carla and Adam t alking about everyone’s favorite subject, politics.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carla:  Our government should do more to help peopl e who can’t find jobs.

Adam:  Be careful.  You’re starting to sound like a  socialist.  Haven’t you always said that you’re a staunch capitalist?

Carla:  Of course, I’m a capitalist, but that doesn ’t mean I think the government should be completely hands-off.  We pay taxes and t he government has a responsibility to take care of its citizens.

Adam:  Ooo, now you’re sounding like a communist.  Next thing I know, you’ll be calling for a revolution.

Carla:  I’m serious.  I think the government should  help people find jobs and pay for their living expenses until they get back on th eir feet.

Adam:  Okay, but in a capitalistic society, you’re subject to market forces.  If people aren’t buying, businesses aren’t producing o r providing services.  That puts people out of work.  Do you think the governme nt should intervene?

Carla:  I just think the government should do more,  that’s all.

Adam:  Okay, but that would mean higher taxes.

Carla:  Yes, we should tax the rich, the more the b etter.

Adam:  Aren’t you among the top 10 percent of incom e earners?

Carla:  I mean they should tax the one percent!

Adam:  Pass the buck, you mean.

Carla:  No, I mean we need better distribution of w ealth.  Are you with me or against me?

Adam:  That depends on when you’re planning to star t the revolution, comrade.

[end of dialogue]

Carla begins our dialogue by saying to Adam, “Our g overnment should do more to help people who can’t find jobs (who can’t find work).”  Adam says, “Be careful.  You’re starting to sound like a socialist .”  A “socialist” is someone who believes in “socialism,” the political philosophy t hat the government should own and run a large number of the businesses in a socie ty, or should basically be in charge of the economy to a greater extent.  A “capi talist” would be someone who believed that the businesses should be owned by ind ividuals and not be interfered with by the government.  Those, of cours e, are very broad differences, but I think you get the idea.

Adam says, “Haven’t you always said that you’re a s taunch capitalist?”  He’s asking Carla.  Carla says, “Of course, I’m a capita list, but that doesn’t mean I think the government should be completely hands-off .”  “To be hands-off” means not to be involved.  Carla is saying the government  should be involved in the economy somehow, in this case to help people who do n’t have jobs.  Carla says, “We pay taxes and the government has a responsibili ty to take care of its citizens.”  “Taxes,” you probably know, is money th at you pay to the government, either when you buy something or when you make mone y at your job.  Carla says, “the government has a responsibility to take care of (to watch over) its citizens.”  “Citizens” are people who belong to a c ertain country.  I’m a citizen of the United States; I have a United States passport.

Well, Adam says, “Ooo, now you’re sounding like a c ommunist.”  A “communist” would be a person who believes the government shoul d basically run the entire economy, that everything should be in the hands of the government.  A socialist would not want the government to own all of the mea ns of production; they would not want the government to control everything.  A c ommunist, however, would

want the government to be in charge of the entire e conomy.  Once again, I know that’s not a perfect description, but it’s the gene ral idea when we’re talking about the economic aspects of these different philosophie s.

Adam says, “Next thing I know, you’ll be calling for a revolution.”  The expression “next thing I know” is used to predict what might h appen in the future, but usually when we say this you’re kind of joking, you’re bein g sarcastic.  “Next thing I know, you’ll be calling for a revolution.”  Adam do esn’t really think Carla will be calling for or asking for or demanding a revolution .  A “revolution” is when, usually, you take over the government in order to c hange the government, often by using violence.

But Carla doesn’t want to joke the way Adam does.  She says, “I’m serious.  I think the government should help people find jobs a nd pay for their living expenses until they get back on their feet.”  “To g et back on your feet” means to become independent again, especially when we are ta lking about money, you are able to pay your own rent and buy your own food .  We use this expression when someone has had some problems, some difficulti es.  Maybe they can’t afford to buy food or can’t pay their rent, so some one else helps them until they get back on their feet, until they can be independe nt again.  That could also happen if you are injured physically.

Adam says, “Okay, but in a capitalistic society, yo u’re subject to market forces.” “To be subject to (something)” means to be influenc ed or controlled by something.  The “market” refers to people buying an d selling things, in general. “Market forces” would be a general description of t he buying and the selling, what we would call “the laws of supply and demand,” wher e prices are determined by how much people want something and how much of that  something there is. Adam says, “If people aren’t buying (people aren’t purchasing), businesses aren’t producing or providing services.  That puts people out of work.”  “To put (someone) out of work” means to make people lose th eir job, to do something that causes people to lose their job.  Adam says, “ Do you think the government should intervene?”  “To intervene” (intervene) mean s to become involved in something, usually to try to change that something,  to change the results.  So, if the government intervenes in the economy, they do s omething to change the way the economy is working.

Carla says, “I just think the government should do more, that’s all.”  She doesn’t have a specific idea; she just thinks the governmen t should do something.  Adam says, “Okay, but that would mean higher taxes,” mea ning if the government got involved people would have to pay more money to the  government.  Carla says, “Yes, we should tax the rich, the more the better.”   We should make rich people

pay more money – pay more taxes.  She says, “the mo re the better,” meaning the more money they pay the better things will be.

Adam says, “Aren’t you among the top 10 percent of income earners?”  “Income” is money that you receive from either working or fr om investing your money. “Earners” are people who work and get paid for thei r work.  So, it’s a little redundant, you could just say “earners,” but Adam s ays “income earners.”  He’s saying that Carla is in the top 10 percent of peopl e in the country in terms of how much money she makes.  So she’s pretty, or fairly r ich.

Carla says, “I mean the government should tax the o ne percent!”  She’s saying no, no, they shouldn’t tax me, but they should tax people who have more money than I do, not the top 10 percent, but the top 1 pe rcent.  Adam says, “Pass the buck, you mean.”  The phrase “to pass the buck” (bu ck) means to try to make someone else responsible for your actions, especial ly if you do something wrong, to try to blame someone else.  Here, I think, Adam means more generally to have other people pay for the things that you want.

Carla says, “No, I mean we need better distribution  of wealth.”  “To distribute” means to give things to different people.  “Wealth”  is, in this case, money.  So, the “distribution of wealth” is who has the money i n a certain society, in a certain country.  There’s another expression, “redistributi on of wealth,” which means taking money from some people, usually rich people,  and giving it to people who have less money.  Carla says, “Are you with me or a gainst me?”  “To be with (someone)” here would mean to agree with them, to s upport their position.  “To be against (someone)” would be to disagree.  Carla is asking whether Adam agrees or disagrees with her, whether Adam will sup port her or not.  “Are you with me or against me?”

Adam, again making a joke, says, “That depends on w hen you’re planning to start the revolution, comrade.”  “Comrade” (comrade ) means friend, but it was used traditionally to talk to fellow citizens in a communist country – in a communist society.  So once again, Adam is saying t hat Carla is like a communist because she wants the government to raise  taxes on the rich to help the poor.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carla:  Our government should do more to help peopl e who can’t find jobs.

Adam:  Be careful.  You’re starting to sound like a  socialist.  Haven’t you always said that you’re a staunch capitalist?

Carla:  Of course, I’m a capitalist, but that doesn ’t mean I think the government should be completely hands-off.  We pay taxes and t he government has a responsibility to take care of its citizens.

Adam:  Ooo, now you’re sounding like a communist.  Next thing I know, you’ll be calling for a revolution.

Carla:  I’m serious.  I think the government should  help people find jobs and pay for their living expenses until they get back on th eir feet.

Adam:  Okay, but in a capitalistic society, you’re subject to market forces.  If people aren’t buying, businesses aren’t producing o r providing services.  That puts people out of work.  Do you think the governme nt should intervene?

Carla:  I just think the government should do more,  that’s all.

Adam:  Okay, but that would mean higher taxes.

Carla:  Yes, we should tax the rich, the more the b etter.

Adam:  Aren’t you among the top 10 percent of incom e earners?

Carla:  I mean they should tax the one percent!

Adam:  Pass the buck, you mean.

Carla:  No, I mean we need better distribution of w ealth.  Are you with me or against me?

Adam:  That depends on when you’re planning to star t the revolution, comrade.

# Socializing With Clients

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 784: Socializing With Clients.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 784.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  How are you tod ay?  I’m fine, thank you for asking.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide, and you can find that Learning Guide on our website, eslpod.com.  Be come a member and download the Learning Guide today.

This episode is a dialogue between Georgia and Dan about socializing with your clients, going out with your customers on a social occasion.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Georgia:  Do you know what the best part is of my n ew promotion?  The expense account!  I can’t wait to wine and dine our clients .

Dan:  The purpose of the expense account is to win over new clients and to keep our current clients happy.  It’s not a personal slu sh fund, you know.

Georgia:  I know.  The point is to network and to b uild client relationships – blah- blah-blah.

Dan:  Schmoozing is part of our job and it’s not so mething to be taken lightly.

Georgia:  Of course not.  But I’m looking forward t o attending charity events to rub elbows with the business elite.  Free food, fre e booze, and free entertainment.  What more could I ask for?

Dan:  Talk to me in three months after you’ve had a  few too many plates of rubber chicken!

[end of dialogue]

Georgia begins our dialogue by saying, “Do you know  what the best part is of my new promotion?”  A “promotion” can mean a couple of  different things.  Here, it means when you get a better job at your company.  You get more money,

usually, and more responsibility.  That’s a promoti on.  A “promotion” can also be something like a sale on an item in a store, but he re it means getting a better job in your company.  Going from vice-president to pres ident, that would be a promotion.

Well, Georgia got a promotion, and the best part of  it is the expense account.  An “expense” is money that you have to pay for somethi ng for your work.  An “account” is a way of keeping track of or a way of knowing how much you are spending.  Here, we put the two together, “expense account,” and we’re talking about the money that a company will give you to spe nd on things that are related to company business.  So when you travel, for examp le, well you need to eat – you need to go to a restaurant.  The company will p ay for that; it’s part of your expense account.  It’s part of the money they give you for buying things related to your job.

Georgia says, “I can’t wait to wine and dine our cl ients.”  “To wine (wine) and dine (dine)” means to go and entertain someone with  wine – alcohol – and food. “To dine” means to eat, in this case.  So, “to wine  and dine” usually means taking someone – one of your customers, one of your client s – to a nice restaurant as part of your sales approach or to thank them for bu ying things from your company.  A “client” (client) is, as I said, anothe r word for a customer.  Usually in a big company, or when you have a customer who buys  a lot of things from your company, we call those customers “clients.”

Dan says, “The purpose of the expense account is to  win over new clients.”  “To win (someone) over” or “to win over (someone)” is a  two-word – say it with me – phrasal verb meaning to persuade or convince someon e; to get someone, in this case, to agree with you to buy something from your company.  Well, Dan says the purpose the company has for giving Georgia an e xpense account is to get new clients – to win over new clients and to keep t he current clients happy.  The “current clients” are the clients you already have,  your customers that you have right now.  Dan says the expense account is not a p ersonal slush fund.  A “slush (slush) fund” is money that you can spend for any p urpose, and often don’t have to tell anyone about it.  Slush funds can sometimes  be used for illegal purposes. A slush fund is any money the company spends that it doesn’t keep track of. Usually that’s not allowed; you have to say where a ll of your money is going. But, a slush fund would be money that the company d oesn’t keep track of.  Dan says that an expense account is definitely not a sl ush fund.

Georgia says, “I know.  The point is to network and  to build client relationships – blah-blah-blah.”  “To network” (network) means to c reate business partnerships, to get know other people who might be clients in the future or who might help you

or your company.  It’s a verb that has become popul ar in the last 20-30 years or so, one of those words you will hear in the busines s world – to network.  Another common business expression is “to build client rela tionships.”  Well, a “relationship” is some connection you have with ano ther person.  “Client relationships” would be the communication and conne ction you have with your clients – with your customers.  But Georgia, at the  end, says, “blah-blah-blah.” What does that mean, “blah-blah-blah”?  “Blah-blah- blah” (spelled blah-blah- blah) is an informal expression we use when we don’ t want to provide all of the details, we don’t want to give a full description of something because you understand it or it’s boring and complex and we don ’t really need to repeat it. Often it’s used sort of to dismiss or to say that t hese things aren’t very important. Your children may say, for example, to their friend s, “Oh, my parents want me to clean my room and do my homework, blah-blah-blah.”  You see, they don’t think it’s very important.  It’s also suggesting that the re are other things that you have told your children to do that they’re not saying be cause it’s sort of understood. The other person will know what they’re talking abo ut, and also know that your children don’t find those things very important.  M aybe you should talk to your children!  Well, that’s the way Georgia feels, that  yes, of course, the expense account is to help the business, but she doesn’t re ally believe that when she says, “blah-blah-blah.”

Dan says, “Schmoozing is part of our job and it’s n ot something to be taken lightly.”  “To schmooze” (schmooze) means to have i nformal conversations with people, designed to make them feel comfortable.  Th ey’re not about, often, the business itself.  When you’re talking to one of you r clients, you may be schmoozing them by talking about the weather or a b aseball game or how you both love bicycling or your last vacation to Mexico .  Whatever it is, you’re talking about informal topics, usually not even related to your business, for the purpose of becoming friendly, perhaps of making them feel w elcome or making them feel important.  Dan says, “Schmoozing is part of our jo b and it’s not something to be taken lightly.”  The expression “to take (something ) lightly” or “to be taken lightly” means to be unimportant, not to be taken seriously.   Dan says that schmoozing is something that’s serious, it’s not something to be taken lightly – to be considered not important, because it is important.

Georgia says, “Of course not.  But I’m looking forw ard to attending charity events to rub elbows with the business elite.”  A “charity ” (charity) is a group that gives money to other groups, usually to help them to help  poor people or people who need help.  They often have events; they have a par ty to help raise money – to get more money for their organization.  That would be a charity event.  “To rub elbows” is an informal expression meaning to spend time with someone or to work closely with someone, especially if that perso n is an important person.  The

“elite” (elite) are a group of people who are consi dered the best in their field or the most important people in their field.  Georgia says, “Free food, free booze, and free entertainment.”  “Booze” (booze) is anothe r word for alcohol: beer, wine, and so forth.  Georgia says, “What more could I ask  for?”  That expression means I have everything that I need; I don’t need a nything more if I have this.

Dan says, “Talk to me in three months after you’ve had a few too many plates of rubber chicken!”  The expression “a few too many” m eans too many, it’s emphasizing that you will have too many of this thi ng – a few too many.  “Plates of rubber chicken” means eating chicken – a “plate”  would just be a meal or something that’s served to you at a dinner.  Why do  we say “rubber chicken”? Well, when you go to a big party – a big event and they have a meal, chicken is a very popular dish, because most people will eat chi cken.  “Rubber chicken” means the chicken is overcooked, or it doesn’t tast e very good.  When you try to cook for, say, 500 people, it’s difficult to make e ach meal good tasting, and what you often have is food that doesn’t taste very good , and that’s why we have the expression “rubber chicken.”  When chicken is overc ooked, of course, it gets hard and a little difficult to eat.

Now let’s listen to our dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Georgia:  Do you know what the best part is of my n ew promotion?  The expense account!  I can’t wait to wine and dine our clients .

Dan:  The purpose of the expense account is to win over new clients and to keep our current clients happy.  It’s not a personal slu sh fund, you know.

Georgia:  I know.  The point is to network and to b uild client relationships – blah- blah-blah.

 When you have one of the elite scriptwriters on the  Internet, Dr. Lucy Tse, what more could you ask for?





# Consulting a Pharmacist

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 785: Consulting a Pharmacist.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 785.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there and take a loo k at some of our ESL Podcast special courses in business and daily Engli sh, read our ESL Podcast Blog, and, of course, become a member of ESL Podcas t and get the Learning Guides for these episodes.

In this dialogue, we go to the pharmacy, or the dru gstore, to buy some drugs. Sounds fun.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Pharmacist:  Can I help you?

Sanaz:  Yes, I had some questions for the pharmacis t.

Pharmacist:  I’m the pharmacist.  How can I help yo u?

Sanaz:  Can I fill these prescriptions here?

Pharmacist:  Yes, you can.  Just give those to the pharmacy technician and she’ll take care of you.

Sanaz:  The reason I ask is that I’m hoping there’s  a home remedy for my problems so I don’t have to pay for prescription me dication.

Pharmacist:  If you’ve already seen a doctor, then I would follow his or her instructions on what to do, including taking these medications.

Sanaz:  All right, but I have some other problems.

Pharmacist:  Like what?

Sanaz:  I have a rash on my arm.  See?  Is there an  over-the-counter medication I can use?

 Pharmacist:  That doesn’t look too serious.  You ca n find medications for rashes on aisle three.  I would recommend a cream made by McQ Pharmaceuticals. Use it for a few days and monitor it to see if it i mproves.  If not, you may want to see your doctor about it.

Sanaz:  Okay, thanks.  I also have allergies.

Pharmacist:  There are several drugstore medication s for allergies.

Sanaz:  I already take those.  What I want to know is if there is something I can do about the headaches I get from the allergies?

Pharmacist:  Pain relievers are on aisle four.  Let  me show you where they are.

Sanaz:  Oh, thank you.  On the way there, I’ll tell  you about my other health problems.  I need eye drops for my dry eyes, pills for my insomnia, something for my back pain…

[end of dialogue]

We begin with the pharmacist saying to Sanaz, “Can I help you?”  Sanaz says, “Yes, I have some questions for the pharmacist.”  T he “pharmacist” is the person who is in charge of or runs the pharmacy or drugsto re.  A pharmacist has to go to school to get a degree, and must have a license in the particular state to be a pharmacist.  They are the ones who prepare medicine s and make sure that you’re getting the right medicine.

The pharmacist says, “I’m the pharmacist.  How can I help you?”  Sanaz says, “Can I fill these prescriptions here?”  A “prescrip tion” (prescription) is the doctor’s written – usually – permission for you to receive a  certain drug.  It used to be that in order to get a drug from a pharmacist – a specia l drug, a drug that required permission – you had to have a written note from the doctor that would give you that permission, and you would take that note to the pharmacy.  Now, much of this is done on the computer – electronically, but they still have paper prescriptions.  The “prescription” is the piece of paper that has the doctor’s signature on it.  Notice that Sanaz uses the verb “ fill.”  “Filling a prescription” means getting the drug that the prescription says y ou can have.

The pharmacist says, “Yes, you can,” you can fill t hese prescriptions here.  She says, “Just give those to the pharmacy technician a nd she’ll take care of you.” The “pharmacy technician” is someone who works for the pharmacist, who is not

a pharmacist themselves.  They are the people who d o the actual taking of the prescription, putting it into the computer, looking  for the drug, and so forth. “Technician” here really means assistant.

Sanaz says, “The reason I ask is that I’m hoping th ere’s a home remedy for my problems so I don’t have to pay for prescription me dication.”  A “home remedy” (remedy) is when you have some sort of medical prob lem – you’re sick – and you want to cure your problem, you want to get yourself  better not by taking some sort of drug from the pharmacy, but perhaps drinkin g some kind of tea or taking some other sort of vitamin that might help you; the se would all be home remedies.  In the United States traditionally if yo u have a cold we would say the home remedy would be chicken soup.  If you eat chic ken soup you will feel better.  I don’t think it will actually help your c old, but maybe.  That’s an example of a home remedy.  “Medication” is usually somethin g that is from a pharmacy.  It is a “drug” – that’s another word for “medication,”  or simply “medicine.”  All of those mean the same thing: “medicine,” “medication, ” “drug.”  Sanaz doesn’t want to pay for the prescription medication, the dr ugs that the doctor told him to take.

The pharmacist says, “If you’ve already seen a doct or” – notice again the verb, “to see a doctor” means to go to and be examined by  and talk to a doctor – “then,” she says, “I would follow his or her instru ctions on what to do, including taking these medications.”  In the United States, t he pharmacist isn’t going to change the orders of the doctor, or probably won’t say something to you that would be different than what your doctor would say;  that’s not their job.

Sanaz says, “All right, but I have some other probl ems.”  The pharmacist asks, “Like what?”  And here, the pharmacist might be abl e to help you with things that you did not discuss with your doctor, although agai n, it depends on what you ask him or her.  If your problem is that you’re ugly an d you want a new face, well, the pharmacist probably can’t help you with that.  Well , that’s not exactly what Sanaz is talking about here, although he might be ugly; I  don’t know; I’ve never met him.

Sanaz says, “I have some other problems,” and the p harmacist asks, “Like what?”  What are they?  Sanaz says, “I have a rash on my arm.  See?”  A “rash” (rash) is a red bump or a bunch of little red bumps  on your skin.  They often itch; they often give you this sensation that makes you want to scratch them with your fingers, for example.  That’s a rash.  A rash can b e caused by many different things.

Sanaz says, “Is there an over-the-counter medicatio n I can use?”  The term “over-the-counter” (counter) refers to drugs that y ou can buy in the pharmacy

without a prescription; you don’t need the doctor’s  approval to buy this drug.  So if you want aspirin, for example, you don’t need a prescription; you can just go to the pharmacy and buy aspirin.  That’s an example of  an over-the-counter medication; sometimes you’ll see the initials O.T.C .  “O.T.C.” stands for over-the- counter.

The pharmacist says that the rash that Sanaz has do esn’t look too serious.  She says, “You can find medications (again, medicine) f or rashes on aisle three.” “Aisle” (aisle) is just a section in the store.  Mo st stores put their products, the things they’re selling, on shelves, and you walk in  between the shelves up and down to find what you need.  Well, those spaces bet ween shelves are called “aisles” – or I guess the whole thing could be call ed an “aisle.”

In any case, the pharmacist tells Sanaz he can go t o aisle number three.  She says, “I would recommend a cream made by McQ Pharma ceuticals.”  A “cream” here means a lotion; that is, a thick substance tha t you rub on your skin.  Creams can be for lots of different things.  Women often p ut creams on their faces to make them more beautiful.  I don’t know; I’m pretty  ugly; I don’t think there are any creams I could use.  But, Sanaz could get a cre am for his rash to help it. The pharmacist recommends getting a cream made by a  certain company – a certain pharmaceutical company.  The word “pharmace utical” sounds like “pharmacy” or “pharmacist.”  It comes from the same  “root,” we would say, the same basic word.  It just means a company that make s drugs – that makes medicines.  The pharmacist says, “Use it for a few days and monitor it to see if it improves.”  “Monitor” here means to observe, to wat ch.  “Monitor” has some other meanings in English, as well.  Take a look at  our Learning Guide for those.

So, the pharmacist tells Sanaz to monitor his rash,  to keep looking at it to see if it gets any better.  “If not” she says, “you may want to see your doctor about it.” Sanaz says, “Okay, thanks.”  Then he says, “I also have allergies.”  “Allergies” (allergies) – the singular is “allergy,” with a “y”  at the end – is when your body reacts to certain substances.  It could be somethin g in the air, it could be something you eat, it could be something you touch with your skin.  I have allergies, for example, which cause my nose to get stuffed up; that is, it gets a certain liquid and then I find it hard to talk.  Th at’s why my voice sometimes sounds a little weird when I record these podcasts,  because sometimes I have allergies.

The pharmacist says, “There are several drugstore m edications for allergies.” “Drugstore” is just another word for pharmacy.  Her e, the pharmacist is really saying there are other over-the-counter medications  for that.  Then Sanaz says, “I already take those.  What I want to know is if t here is something I can do about

the headaches I get from the allergies?”  A “headac he” is when you have a pain in your head – or wherever your brain is.  Some peo ple’s brain is in the opposite part of their body!  But, Sanaz has a headache.  the pharmacist recommends pain relievers.  “Pain relievers” are medicines tha t – you guessed it – can reduce or relieve your pain so that it doesn’t hurt as muc h.  Aspirin is an example of a pain reliever.

The pharmacist says, “Let me show you where they ar e.”  Sanaz says, “Oh, thank you.  On the way there (meaning as we’re walk ing to that part of the store), I’ll tell you about my other health problems.  I ne ed eye drops for my dry eyes, pills for my insomnia, something for my back pain…”  and there the dialogue ends.  We assume that Sanaz has many other health p roblems.  When you have “dry eyes,” you have eyes that feel itchy, that nee d some liquid.  “Eye drops” is the liquid that you put in your eyes when they’re d ry.  “Insomnia” (insomnia) is when you can’t fall asleep at night; you’re not abl e to fall asleep easily.  Usually, a “pill” is a small, round thing that you take.  No tice again the verb, you “take” a pill; you put it in your mouth and you swallow it.  That’s one way of getting medicine into your body, through a pill.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Pharmacist:  Can I help you?

Sanaz:  Yes, I had some questions for the pharmacis t.

Pharmacist:  I’m the pharmacist.  How can I help yo u?

Sanaz:  Can I fill these prescriptions here?

Pharmacist:  Yes, you can.  Just give those to the pharmacy technician and she’ll take care of you.

Sanaz:  The reason I ask is that I’m hoping there’s  a home remedy for my problems so I don’t have to pay for prescription me dication.

Pharmacist:  If you’ve already seen a doctor, then I would follow his or her instructions on what to do, including taking these medications.

Sanaz:  All right, but I have some other problems.

 Pharmacist:  Like what?

Sanaz:  I have a rash on my arm.  See?  Is there an  over-the-counter medication I can use?

Pharmacist:  That doesn’t look too serious.  You ca n find medications for rashes on aisle three.  I would recommend a cream made by McQ Pharmaceuticals. Use it for a few days and monitor it to see if it i mproves.  If not, you may want to see your doctor about it.

Sanaz:  Okay, thanks.  I also have allergies.

Pharmacist:  There are several drugstore medication s for allergies.

Sanaz:  I already take those.  What I want to know is if there is something I can do about the headaches I get from the allergies?

Pharmacist:  Pain relievers are on aisle four.  Let  me show you where they are.

Sanaz:  Oh, thank you.  On the way there, I’ll tell  you about my other health problems.  I need eye drops for my dry eyes, pills for my insomnia, something for my back pain…

# Going to a Bar

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 786: Going to a Bar.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 786.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue about going to a “bar,” a place where you go and have an alcoholic drink.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I’d been complaining to a coworker, Amy, about havi ng to move to the burbs for my job.  She said that there were plenty of things to do outside of the city and invited me to a bar she likes. …

Amy:  Hey, there you are.

Mykhailo:  Hey, so this is the famous McQ’s you’ve been talking about.

Amy:  This is it.  What would you like to drink?  T here are several beers on tap and pretty good well drinks.

Mykhailo:  I think I’ll get a couple of shots.

Amy:  On a Wednesday night?  You guys do party hard  in the city.

Mykhailo:  I’ve had a really rough week and I welco me any excuse to let my hair down.  That said, I won’t be getting stinking drunk  on a school night.  You were right.  This place is nice.  It even has a dance fl oor.

Amy:  On the weekends, there’s a live band or a DJ,  although there’s also a cover charge on Fridays and Saturdays.

Mykhailo:  So you do know how to party in the burbs .

Amy:  Didn’t I tell you?

Mykhailo:  But for me to get a thorough impression of the burbs, I’ll have to come here to check it out this weekend.  What are you do ing Saturday night?

Amy:  Actually, I plan on coming here.

Mykhailo:  Want some company?

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with Mykhailo saying, “I’ve been c omplaining to a coworker.” “To complain” means to talk about something negativ e, to say how unhappy you are about something that is happening.  Mykhailo’s been complaining to a “coworker,” someone he works with named Amy, “about  having to move to the burbs for my job.”  “Burbs” (burbs) is an informal word for suburb.  “Suburbs” are areas around the main city, outside of the downtown  area, usually outside of a major city.  In Los Angeles, the suburbs would be a ll of the cities around the City of Los Angeles, around the biggest city.

Mykhailo says Amy “said there were plenty of things  to do outside of the city and invited me to a bar she likes.”  A “bar,” which wou ld be called a “pub” in England, or a “tavern,” is a place that serves mostly alcoho lic beverages: beer, wine, whiskey, rum, and so forth.  I like rum personally,  if I have an alcoholic drink, which is very, very rarely now.  But I really like the taste of rum – Bacardi Rum – especially the rum from Mexico for some reason.  the Mexican Bacardi is very good, as good as I think the Puerto Rican rum.  Now , if you’re from Puerto Rico you’ll probably email and complain that I said that , but there you go.  Anyway, I’m not drinking; I’m recording a podcast so let’s cont inue.

Amy says, “Hey, there you are.”  We would say that expression “there you are” for someone who you were looking for or perhaps you  were waiting for and they finally came.  Mykhailo says, “Hey, so this is the famous McQ’s you’ve been talking about.”  The name of the bar is called McQ’ s, no relation to me.  Amy says, “This is it.  What would you like to drink?  They have several beers on tap and pretty good well drinks.”  “On tap” means avail able usually from a faucet.  If a beer is on tap, it’s in a big barrel – a big contai ner, and it comes right out of that container into the glass – into the mug where you p our the beer and drink the beer out of.  The opposite would be beer in a bottl e, but beer on tap is beer that the bar has in a big container.  A “well (well) dri nk” is any alcoholic drink made from some other kind of alcohol, like whiskey or ru m.  Usually it’s mixed with

something else, either some sort of soda pop, or so me juice, or some water, or something similar.

Mykhailo says, “I think I’ll get a couple of shots. ”  Well, there are a number of different things you can order at a bar.  A well dr ink, or just a drink, would be what some people might call a “cocktail,” that woul d be, for example, rum and Coke, which we call a Cuba Libre, or a Tom Collins,  or a whiskey seven – whiskey with 7-Up.  Those are all well drinks.  A “ shot” is when you just have alcohol in a small, little container called a “shot  glass,” and it’s a very small amount of alcohol.  You could have a whiskey shot, or a shot of whiskey, which would be just one little container full of alcohol,  usually served in a very small glass – in a shot glass.

So, Mykhailo says, “I think I’ll get a couple of sh ots.”  Amy says, “On a Wednesday night?  You guys do party hard in the cit y.”  She’s surprised because getting a couple of shots is a lot of alcohol, and it’s in the middle of the week, so she’s surprised that Mykhailo wants to drink so muc h.  That’s why she says, “You guys (you people who live in the city) party hard.”   “To party” means to have a good time, to celebrate, to drink and dance.  “To p arty hard” would be to enjoy yourself, usually by drinking a lot of alcohol, an extreme amount of alcohol, alcohol that would get you drunk quickly and for a long time.

Mykhailo says, “I’ve had a really rough (or difficu lt) week and I welcome any excuse to let my hair down.”  “To welcome any excus e to let your hair down” would be to use any opportunity or reason to relax and have fun.  Not quite sure about his use of the term “let my hair down.”  That ’s something a woman might say more likely than a man, but maybe Mykhailo has,  uh, long hair; I don’t know. He says, “That said, I won’t be getting stinking dr unk on a school night.”  “That said” means nevertheless.  Even though he is lookin g for an excuse to party – to let his hair down – he won’t be getting stinking dr unk.  “To be drunk” is to be intoxicated, to have too much alcohol.  “To be stin king drunk” is an informal expression meaning to be really drunk, to be incred ibly drunk, to be very drunk. A “school night” is kind of a joke here.  When you are in school, of course any time you have to go to school the next day you can’ t go out and party at night. Your parents will often say you have to study and b e to bed by 10:00 on a school night.  So, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursda y – well, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday are all school  nights because the next day you have school, Monday through Friday.  Howeve r, people sometimes use it just to mean a work night, a day that – or a nig ht that will be followed by a day that you have to go to work.  That’s what Mykhailo is talk about.

He says, “You were right.  This place is nice.  It even has a dance floor.”  A “dance floor” is an area where you can dance to mus ic, of course.  Amy says, “On the weekends, there’s a live band or a DJ.”  A “live band” is a musical group that performs; there are actually people up there s inging and playing guitars and other musical instruments.  A “DJ” stands for a dis c jockey; it’s a person whose job it is to – well, it used to be to play records,  to play discs, now they play compact discs or I guess MP3s, I’m not sure.  But t hat’s a DJ, a person who is in charge of selecting the music.  Amy says, “there’s also a cover charge on Fridays and Saturdays.”  A “cover charge” means you have to  pay money just to get into the bar or the club and, of course, you also have t o pay for your drinks.  A cover charge is, I don’t know, it used to be like 5, 10, 15 dollars.  Now it’s probably more than that, I haven’t been to a bar with a cove r charge since Ronald Reagan was president!

Mykhailo says, “So you do know how to party in the burbs.”  Amy says, “Didn’t I tell you?”  Mykhailo’s saying you guys also know ho w to have a good time. Mykhailo says, “But for me to get a thorough impres sion of the burbs, I’ll have to come here to check it out this weekend.”  A “thorou gh impression” means a complete idea.  An “impression” can mean the way th at you understand something, the opinion you have about something.  “ Impression” can have a few other meanings as well; take a look at our Learning  Guide for those.

So, Mykhailo is saying that in order to really unde rstand whether this bar is a good place he’ll have to come back on the weekend.  He says to Amy, “What are you doing Saturday night?”  Now of course, Mykhailo  and Amy are friends, but now it sounds like Mykhailo wants to see Amy again at this bar, so perhaps he has other ideas.  Amy says, “Actually, I planned on  coming here.”  I was already going to come to this bar again on the weekend.  My khailo says, “Want some company?”  “Company” is other people who spend time  with you.  And of course, we think Mykhailo possibly is interested romantical ly in Amy.  We’ll have to see later on.  When?  Probably never!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

I’d been complaining to a coworker, Amy, about havi ng to move to the burbs for my job.  She said that there were plenty of things to do outside of the city and invited me to a bar she likes. …

Amy:  Hey, there you are.

# Speaking to a Baby or Young Child

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 787: Speaking to a Baby or Young Child.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 787.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there and download a  Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is all about the kind of words you wou ld use when talking to a baby or a small child, something a mother, a father, or perhaps a babysitter – someone watching a young child – might say.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

My sister had to go out of town for a couple of day s and I offered to look after her 18-month-old twins.  It wasn’t long before I realiz ed that I was over my head! …

Colleen:  Okay, you two, it’s time to go beddy-bye.

Baby:  No!

Colleen:  Yes, let’s get your jammies on.  You can keep your binkie for now. Your blankie is already in your bed and it’s time t o go night-night.

Baby:  Potty!

Colleen:  Okay, once you have your jammies on, we’l l go potty.  What’s the matter, Mark?

Baby:  Owie!

Colleen:  You have an owie?  Where?  In your tummy?   Oh, you have a boo-boo on your finger.  No, don’t stick your wet finger in  your brother’s ear.  That’s icky. Wait one teensy-weensy minute and I’ll put a band-a id on it.

Baby:  Whee!

Colleen:  Michael, you can’t jump off the chair lik e that.  That’s a no-no.  Oopsie- daisy!

Baby:  Waaaaa! …

Michael had learned his lesson and so had I!

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with Colleen saying that her siste r had to go out of town for a couple of days and I offered to look after her 18-m onth-old twins.  “To look after (someone)” means to take care of someone: “I’m goin g to look after my nephew, who’s five years old,” or, “I’m going to look after  my neighbor’s dog while he is on vacation.”  Neither of those things I would actuall y do however, just an example! Well in the story, Colleen offers to look after her  18-month-old twins – well, her sister’s 18-month-old twins.  “Twins” are two child ren who are born at the same time from the same mother – well obviously, one usu ally comes out of the mother before the other.  I have twins in my family; I hav e older brothers who are twins. My sister has two children who are also twins.  In the story, we have two twins who are 18 months old, a year and a half.  Colleen says, “It wasn’t long before I realized that I was over my head!”  We might more c ommonly say, “I was in over my head.”  “To be over your head” means to be in a situation that is too difficult for you, that you are not able to manage or handle.

Colleen says to the babies, “Okay, you two (you two  babies), it’s time to go beddy-bye.”  “Beddy-bye” comes from the word “bed” (bed) and “goodbye.” “Beddy-bye” (beddy-bye) is an expression you use wi th young children to talk about going to bed and falling asleep.  You may say , “Well, let’s go beddy-bye,” or, “It’s time for you to go beddy-bye,” meaning yo u have to leave now and go to your room and fall asleep; at least that’s the plan .

The baby says, “No!”  Colleen says okay, “let’s get  your jammies on.”  “Jammies” (jammies) is a word you use with young children to describe pajamas.  “Pajamas” are the clothing that you put on to go to bed, if y ou wear clothing to bed.  If you don’t, I don’t need to know that!  Colleen says, “You can keep your binkie for now.”  A “binkie” (binkie) is, again, a word you wo uld only use with a young child, a baby.  It means a “pacifier,” which is a small pi ece of usually plastic that you put in the baby’s mouth so that they shut up – I me an, so that they don’t cry.  The baby sucks on the pacifier, and it’s called a “bink ie.”  Why a “binkie”?  I don’t know.  I tried to take care of my niece once, when she was, oh, maybe a year

and a half old, just like the example here.  It was  a total disaster.  I never offered to babysit – to look after my brother’s children ag ain.  That was 1978, by the way.

Well, back to our story.  Colleen tells the babies,  “Your blankie is already in your bed and it’s time to go night-night.”  “Blankie” (b lankie) is again a word, like most of these words, you would only use with a small chi ld or a baby.  “Blankie” is a “blanket,” something you put on you to keep yoursel f warm in a bed.  “Night- night” is like “beddy-bye,” it’s a word you say to children when they’re going to bed and falling asleep.  You might also say it just  to mean “good night.”  “Night- night” would mean “good night” to young child.

The baby, however, has other ideas, as babies often  do.  One of the babies says, “Potty!”  “Potty” (potty) is a baby word for bathro om or toilet.  You might say to a young child, say under the age of four, “Do you hav e to go potty?”  “Do you have to go to the potty?”  Either one would be correct.  You’re asking them if they need to use the bathroom – for those who are old enough,  of course, to use the bathroom.  So the baby says, “Potty,” meaning that he or she – he, in this case – wants to go to the bathroom.  Colleen says, “Okay, once you have your jammies on, we’ll go potty,” meaning we’ll go to the bathro om – take you to the bathroom.

Then, she says, “What’s the matter, Mark?”  Mark is  the name of one of the babies; it’s also the name of one of my brothers, w ho is a twin.  The baby says, “Owie!”  “Owie,” which I guess we would spell (owie ), is a word that children use to talk about some injury, when they hurt themselve s, if something hurts.  A parent might also use it with a child: “Do you have  an owie?”  Do you have something that hurts, usually if you cut yourself o r hit yourself.  Colleen says, “You have an owie?  Where?  In your tummy?”  “Tummy ” (tummy) is a baby word for stomach.  Colleen says, “Oh, you have a boo-boo  on your finger.”  A “boo- boo” (boo-boo) is a baby word similar to “owie,” wh en you cut yourself or hit yourself or hurt yourself somewhere.

Colleen says, “Now, don’t stick your wet finger in your brother’s ear.  That’s icky.” Something that is “icky” (icky) is unpleasant, it’s  unattractive, we might say it’s “gross.”  It’s, again, a word used with children.  Colleen says, “Wait one teensy- weensy minute and I’ll put a band-aid on it.”  “Tee nsy-weensy” is a baby word to used to describe something that is very small.  Ano ther similar expression is “itsy-bitsy,” but “teensy-weensy” is perhaps a litt le more common I guess, I don’t know.  I don’t talk to babies very often.  But, Col leen uses “teensy-weensy,” a “teensy-weensy minute,” meaning a very short amount  of time, and she’ll put a band-aid on the baby’s boo-boo.  A “band-aid” is a small, sticky piece of plastic, or some other material, that you put over a cut.  W hen a child or an adult cuts themselves, when they have a cut in the skin that m ay be bleeding – blood is

coming out of it – you would put a band-aid on it –  a bandage.  I think Band-Aid is like Kleenex, what we call a “brand name,” it’s act ually the name of a company; the technical word, or the common word would be a “ bandage.”  But it’s quite common for people just to call it a “band-aid,” the  way in some countries they use the word “hoover” to talk about a vacuum cleaner, i n British English I believe.

The baby says, “Whee!”  “Whee” would be when a baby  is happy they may say something like that.  Colleen says, “Michael” – who  is the other young baby, and also my brother; his name is Michael, also a twin –  says, “Michael, you can’t jump off the chair like that.  That’s a no-no.”  A “no-no” is a word we use, again with children, for something that is not allowed, s omething that is not permitted, something they cannot do.  Colleen says then, “Oops ie-daisy!”  “Oopsie-daisy” is a phrase used with children when they’ve made a mis take, when something didn’t go as you planned it to go.  In English with  adults we would probably just say something like “oops” (oops) – “oops” when you make a mistake.  Some adults may use other words when they make a mistake , as well!

The baby then, who just jumped off the chair – Mich ael just jumped off the chair, and he starts to cry: “Waaaaa!”  “Michael,” Colleen  says, “had learned his lesson and so had I!”  “To learn your lesson” means to lea rn from a difficult situation, maybe a painful situation.  When you do something w rong, you realize your mistake, and we hope you learn your lesson, meaning  you won’t do it again. Michael had learned his lesson, and Colleen says sh e had learned her lesson, too, which is not to babysit her 18-month-old nephe ws!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

My sister had to go out of town for a couple of day s and I offered to look after her 18-month-old twins.  It wasn’t long before I realiz ed that I was over my head! …

Colleen:  Okay, you two, it’s time to go beddy-bye.

This episode is a dialogue about someone who is con servative, not politically, but someone who doesn’t like to take chances, to be ris ky.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Wendy:  I really don’t think Monty is the right per son for this project.  He’s too conservative in his thinking.  We need someone who’ s a risk taker.

Burt:  Monty will get the job done.  That’s the mos t important thing.

Wendy:  Not if the finished product is staid and bo ring.  Our client won’t be happy with that.

Burt:  Okay, who do you have in mind?

Wendy:  I was thinking of giving the project to Lor enzo.

Burt:  Lorenzo?  Well, he certainly likes to push t he envelope, but he’s also a loose cannon.  Sometimes his ideas pan out and some times they fall flat.

Wendy:  But Lorenzo is bold and daring.  Did you se e what he did on his last project?  It was genius!

Burt:  It was reckless.  It was only through sheer luck that everything worked out. I know that Monty’s ideas are more conventional and  low-key, but they’re also tried-and-true.  But, in the end, it’s your call.

Wendy:  In that case, I’m going with Lorenzo.  I’m sure he’ll do a great job.

Burt:  I hope so.  I wouldn’t want us to end up wit h egg on our face.

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Wendy saying to Burt “I re ally don’t think Monty is the right person for this project.  He’s too conservati ve in his thinking.” “Conservative” here means someone who is traditiona l or probably a better way of saying this is it’s someone who doesn’t like to take risks, who’s very careful, who doesn’t like to take chances.  Wendy says, “We need someone who’s a risk taker.”  “Risk” (risk) is sort of like danger; some thing good or bad could happen, you don’t know.  A “risk taker” is someone who will  do things that might not have been tried before, and they may or may not be succe ssful.  It’s sort of the opposite of the conservative person that Wendy does n’t want for this project.

Burt says, “Monty will get the job done (he will co mplete it; he will finish it). That’s the most important thing.”  Wendy says, “Not  if the finished product (the thing that he does, that he accomplishes) is staid and boring.”  “Staid” (staid) means old fashioned, uninteresting; really, it’s the same as “boring.”  Wendy says, “Our client (the person who hired their compa ny; the person who is paying the company) won’t be happy with that.”  Burt says,  “Okay, who do you have in mind?” meaning who are you thinking of for this pro ject.  Wendy says, “I was thinking of giving the project to Lorenzo.”  Burt s ays, “Lorenzo?  Well, he certainly likes to push the envelope.”  The expression “to pu sh the envelope” (envelope) means someone who is a risk taker, someone who goes  to the limits or goes beyond the normal limits of something.  “To push the envelope” would be to do something that no one has done before, but also to do something that is probably somewhat risky, perhaps even dangerous.

Wendy says she wants Lorenzo, but Burt says Lorenzo  is also a loose cannon. A “cannon” (cannon) is a big gun that was more popu lar in, say, the 19 th  century or 18 th centuries.  It’s a big gun; you might find it on a ship, and it, instead of bullets, uses a big, round, ball of metal called a “cannon ball.”  But the expression “loose cannon” means someone who is unpredictable, maybe dangerous, someone you can’t control.  It’s definitely a negat ive way of describing someone. Burt says, “Sometimes his ideas pan out and sometim es they fall flat.”  “To pan (pan) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to be  successful, to result as you wanted it to result, to turn out as you intended it  to turn out.  The opposite of “panning out” would be “fall flat.”  “To fall flat”  means to be unsuccessful, or to do something that other people don’t like and therefor e to fail.

Wendy says, “But Lorenzo is bold and daring.”  “To be bold” (bold) means to be brave, to be courageous.  Here, probably, it means someone who’s not afraid to take risks; someone who will do something different , even if other people aren’t

doing it.  “To be daring” is very similar: taking r isks, doing things differently than the way other people do thing, doing something even  when it’s dangerous. That’s daring.  Wendy says, “Did you see what he di d on his last project?  It was genius!”  “Genius” (genius) is very intelligent, ve ry smart, very wise.  It’s a very high compliment.  Here, Wendy means it was intellig ent, but it’s more of a general term to say it was wonderful; it was excell ent.  “It was genius.”

Burt says, “It was reckless (reckless).”  “To be re ckless” is a critical, negative way of describing someone.  It means someone who’s not careful, who’s not paying attention, someone who is perhaps even dangerous.  You can be successful and reckless, but being reckless means that you are not  careful and something bad could happen to you if you have some bad luck.  So if you drive a motorcycle, and you don’t wear a “helmet” on your head, somethi ng to protect your head, that’s reckless.  Although, I guess if you fall off  a motorcycle going at high speeds you’re not going to be in very good shape anyway; it’s not going to be a happy ending.  But you may save if your life by wearing a  helmet.  Well, not wearing a helmet would be reckless.  Burt thinks that Lorenzo  was a reckless in his last project.  Burt says, “It was only through sheer luc k that everything worked out.” “Sheer” (sheer) here means complete or total.  “It was sheer luck,” it was complete luck, nothing but luck; that’s all it was.   “Sheer” has a couple of other meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Gu ide for those.

Burt says, “I know that Monty’s ideas are more conv entional and low-key, but they’re also tried-and-true.”  “Conventional” means  traditional, standard, nothing unusual, nothing exciting.  “Low-key” (low-key) mea ns calm, not attracting a lot of attention, not very exciting.  Monty’s ideas are co nventional and low-key, but they’re also tried-and-true.  This expression “trie d (tried) -and-true (true)” means that they have been tested and shown to be successf ul; we’ve used them before and they work.  Burt says, “in the end, it’s your c all.”  When you say “it’s your call” or “it’s my call” we aren’t talking about a telepho ne call, we’re talking about a decision.  It’s your decision; it’s my decision – it’s your call; it’s my call.  In sports the “referee,” or the person who decides whether the players have broken the rules or not, has to make a decision, and we call t hat decision a “call” (call), as a noun.

Wendy says, “In that case, I’m going with Lorenzo.”   “I’m going with” here means that’s the person I’m going to hire or that’s the p erson I’m going to use.  In general, “to go with (something)” means I’m making a decision to use this thing or this person.  “To go with” can also mean to actu ally leave with someone: “I’m going to go with my girlfriend to a bar this aftern oon.  Don’t tell my wife.”  I’m kidding, I mean you can tell my wife, ‘cause I actu ally don’t have a girlfriend; it’s just a joke – really!

 Wendy says, “I’m going with Lorenzo.  I’m sure he’l l do a great job.”  Burt says, “I hope so.  I wouldn’t want us to end up with egg on our face.”  “To end up” is a very common phrasal verb in English, it means to be  in a certain situation after you have done a number of different other actions –  after you have followed a plan.  So, “I’m going to work every day for two hou rs for one week, and at the end of one week I hope to end up with a good projec t.”  That’s the situation I want after I finish going through my plan; that’s t he idea of “to end up.”  “To end up” can also mean, simply, to result after certain actions; it can be a negative thing, it could be a positive thing.  “He stole money from his boss, and he ended up in prison.”  That was the result of his actions.   Burt says, “I don’t want us to end up with egg on our face.”  This is an old expre ssion; “to have egg (egg) on your face” means to have made a major mistake and t hen you look stupid; you’re embarrassed because you made a big mistake and ever yone sees it or everyone knows about.  That’s “to end up with egg on your fa ce.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Wendy:  I really don’t think Monty is the right per son for this project.  He’s too conservative in his thinking.  We need someone who’ s a risk taker.

Burt:  Monty will get the job done.  That’s the mos t important thing.

Wendy:  Not if the finished product is staid and bo ring.  Our client won’t be happy with that.

Burt:  Okay, who do you have in mind?

Wendy:  I was thinking of giving the project to Lor enzo.

Burt:  Lorenzo?  Well, he certainly likes to push t he envelope, but he’s also a loose cannon.  Sometimes his ideas pan out and some times they fall flat.

Wendy:  But Lorenzo is bold and daring.  Did you se e what he did on his last project?  It was genius!

Burt:  It was reckless.  It was only through sheer luck that everything worked out. I know that Monty’s ideas are more conventional and  low-key, but they’re also tried-and-true.  But, in the end, it’s your call.

Wendy:  In that case, I’m going with Lorenzo.  I’m sure he’ll do a great job.

Burt:  I hope so.  I wouldn’t want us to end up wit h egg on our face.

[end of dialogue]

Our script today was sheer genius.  That’s because it was written by the bold and daring Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Taking Care of Pets

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 789: Taking Care of Pets.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 789.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  You probably know that.  You probably also know you can download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, culture notes, comprehension questions – but wait, there’s more, a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.  This episode is about taking care of pets.  “Pets” are things like dogs and cats, animals that people have in their house – for some weird reason.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]   Magda:  Oooh, he’s so cute.  When did you get him?  Tony:  Yesterday.  I’m training him to do tricks.  Magda:  Really?  Are you having any luck?  Tony:  No, not yet.  So far, he just lies there, but maybe he’s hungry and doesn’t have any energy to play.  I’m going to feed him a few treats and give him some water in his bowl.  Magda:  Uh, okay.  Tony:  And then later, I’m going to take him for a walk.  Here are the new collar and leash I bought for him.  I’ll be sure to bring his carrier in case he gets too tired to walk.  Magda:  Whatever you say.  Are you sure you need to do all that?  Tony:  Oh, sure.  It’s important to keep pets healthy and happy, don’t you think?  I’m going to groom him later.  I wouldn’t want him to get fleas or ticks.  Maybe I should take him to see the vet for a checkup. # Giving Birth to Twins

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 790: Giving Birth to Twins.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 790.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Check out our special c ourses in business and daily English on our website.

Today’s episode is about having a baby – two of the m, in fact.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jerome:  Congratulations!  I just heard that you’re  pregnant with twins.

Paula:  Thanks.  We’re very excited, although I’m a  little worried about a multiple birth.

Jerome:  I come from a long line of multiple births .  My father is an identical twin and he had cousins who are fraternal twins.

Paula:  I see what you mean.

Jerome:  That’s not even the half of it.  My matern al grandmother gave birth to triplets and my aunt had quadruplets.

Paula:  Wow, multiple births certainly run in your family.  What about your immediate family?

Jerome:  You’re not going to believe this, but my m other had octuplets.  I have seven brothers and sisters the same age.

Paula:  And all of you survived?

Jerome:  Yup, every single one of us.  We often jok e that my mother didn’t have babies.  She had a litter!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Jerome saying to Paula, “C ongratulations!  I just heard that you’re pregnant with twins.”  “Pregnant” (preg nant) is when a woman has a child inside her body who is going to be born.  But  Paula is not just pregnant with one child but with two, and that’s why Jerome says she’s going to have twins (twins).  So, Jerome congratulates Paula, so I gues s he’s not the father.

Paula says, “Thanks.  We’re very excited.”  Presuma bly she means her husband, the father of the child.  “We’re a little excited, although I’m a little worried about a multiple birth.”  “Multiple” (multiple) means more than one – multiple anything. You could have multiple children, more than one chi ld; multiple birth would be giving birth to more than one child.  The expressio n “to give birth” means to have the child come out of the mother’s body.

Jerome says, “I come from a long line of multiple b irths.”  Probably one of the few times that sentence has been said in English!  “To come from a long line of” means that you have a history in your family.  I co uld say, “I come from a long line of teachers.”  My father was a teacher, my bro ther was a teacher, and so forth.  Or I could say, more truthful, “I come from  a long line of plumbers.” “Plumbers” are people and fix toilets and sinks.  M y great-grandfather was a plumber, and my grandfather was a plumber, and my u ncles are all plumbers. So, Jerome says he comes from a long line of multip le births, meaning there must be a lot of twins in his family.  And that, in  fact, is what Jerome means.  He says, “My father is an identical twin and he had co usins who are fraternal twins.”

Well if you remember back to your biology class, yo u should know that there are two kinds of twins: there are smart twins and there  are stupid twins.  No, that’s not the difference!  There are identical twins; the se are two babies that look exactly the same, they have the same sex – two boys  or two girls, and usually they look very much alike.  My two brothers – older  brothers, Mark and Mike, are identical twins.  You can also have fraternal twins .  “Fraternal” (fraternal) is a word that comes from the Latin I believe, “frater” (frater), which can mean brother, though in the plural it often means men an d women – brothers and sisters, and that’s really the meaning here.  Frate rnal twins are two babies born at the same time who may or may not be the same sex .  They could be two boys and two girls or it could be a boy and a girl, and usually they don’t look alike.  Or at least, they don’t look identical – the same, as identical twins do.

Paula says, “I see what you mean,” and Jerome respo nds, “That’s not even the half of it.”  This expression, “that’s not even the  half of it,” means that you still have more things to say about this topic.  Jerome h as mentioned two facts: that his father is an identical twin and his father’s co usins are fraternal twins.  But he has even more information about this – even more th ings on this topic, and then

we hear what those are.  Jerome says, “My maternal grandmother gave birth to triplets and my aunt had quadruplets.”  Wow!  “Mate rnal” (maternal) comes from “mater” in Latin – we’re having a Latin lesson toda y!  “Mater” (mater) means mother, and so when Jerome says “my maternal grandm other,” he means his mother’s mother, not his father’s mother.  If it we re his father’s mother, we would say his “paternal grandmother,” from, of course, “p ater” (pater), Latin for father.

Jerome says that his maternal grandmother gave birt h to triplets.  “Triplets” (triplets) are when you have three babies born at t he same time; that’s somewhat rare.  But, even rarer – even more unusual is what happened to his aunt.  His aunt – or his aunt, either pronunciation is correct  – had quadruplets. “Quadruplets” are when you have four babies at one time.  Five babies would be “quintuplets,” and so on and so forth.  Quadruplets  is very rare also – well, even rarer than triplets.

Paula says that multiple births certainly run in Je rome’s family.  When we say something “runs in your family,” we mean it’s somet hing common in your family, that different members of your family share.  This could be anything.  It could be the height: “Tall boys run in our family.”  Or it c ould be anything that is genetic, although sometimes it’s used for things that are pr obably more from the environment.  Some people say, “Oh, playing soccer runs in our family.” Everyone does it: my father does it, my sister does  it, and so forth.  Well, we don’t mean that there is an inherited trait in that  family for soccer, that it comes from your genetics.  But, it means it’s popular or it’s common in your family.

Nowadays, there are actually more people – well, mo re women having multiple births, probably because there’s more use of fertil ity drugs, drugs that help a woman get pregnant.  And these often lead to – or a t least more often, I understand, lead to multiple births.  But of course  I’m not a doctor, and I have never given birth to a child, so I’m not really an expert in this area.  But Paula asks Jerome, “What about your immediate family?”  Y our “immediate family” is your mother, your father, your brothers, and your s isters.  It doesn’t include aunts, uncles, grandparents, and so forth.

Jerome says, “You’re not going to believe this, but  my mother had octuplets.” Okay!  “Octuplets” (octuplets), if you know a littl e Latin, you’ll know this means eight children.  Well, that would be very usual, in deed!  He says, “I have seven brothers and sisters the same age.”  Paula says, “A nd all of you survived?” Obviously, when you have multiple birth there’s mor e of a risk of one of the babies dying.  But Jerome says, “Every single one of us (survived).”  “To survive” means not to die.  “Every single one of us” is just  another way of saying all of us – all of us survived.  “We even joke that my mother  didn’t have babies.  She had

a litter!”  “Litter” (litter) is normally a word we  use for a group of animal babies, born to an animal at one time, like a cat would hav e a litter of kittens.  So Jerome is sort of joking when he says that they say to the ir mother that she had a litter. “Litter” actually has some other meanings in Englis h as well, as does the word “twin,” and you can find both of those in our Learn ing Guide.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jerome:  Congratulations!  I just heard that you’re  pregnant with twins.

Paula:  Thanks.  We’re very excited, although I’m a  little worried about a multiple birth.

Jerome:  I come from a long line of multiple births .  My father is an identical twin and he had cousins who are fraternal twins.

Paula:  I see what you mean.

Jerome:  Yup, every single one of us.  We often jok e that my mother didn’t have babies.  She had a litter!

[end of dialogue]

She doesn’t have any twin brothers or sisters, but she is a wonderful scriptwriter. I’m talking, of course, about our own Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Taking Photographs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 791: Taking Photographs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 791.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is about taking photographs – taking p ictures with a camera.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ryan:  Stop mugging for the camera and stand still!

Katrina:  I’ve been standing still for 10 minutes, while you’ve been setting up the shot.  I have to do something.  This is boring!

Ryan:  I almost have the settings right.  Okay, let ’s try a shot.  Say “cheese.”

Katrina:  Cheese.

Ryan:  Oh, you look washed out in that shot and it’ s blurry.  I think the flash came on when I didn’t want it to.  You have red-eye, too .  I’ll have to adjust the settings again.

Katrina:  Hurry up!

Ryan:  Okay, I think I’ve got it now.  Get back int o your pose.  Lift your head a little to the side and face the sun…

Katrina:  Take the picture!

Ryan:  I just need to focus.  There!  Say “cheese” again.

Katrina:  Cheese.

Ryan:  Um, it’s still not perfect.  Let me put the camera on a tripod.  Try to stay still while I do that.

Katrina:  I thought you wanted the shot to look lik e a candid.

Ryan:  I do, but how am I supposed to make it look like a perfect candid if you keep moving out of your pose?

[end of dialogue]

Ryan begins our dialogue by saying to Katrina, “Sto p mugging for the camera and stand still!”  “To mug (mug) for the camera” me ans to make funny faces or to try to be funny looking in a photograph when someon e’s taking your picture. Sometimes it can mean just to try to get into the p icture; you see someone taking photographs and you walk over so that they will tak e a photograph of you, and so you maybe change your face or your body in such a w ay that they will pay attention to you.  Ryan says, “Stop mugging for the  camera and stand still!”  “Still” (still) means not moving, someone who is without mo tion, who’s not moving, who just is there.  “Still” has a number other meanings , however, in English; some of those are in the Learning Guide.

Katrina says, “I’ve been standing still for 10 minu tes, while you’ve been setting up the shot.”  “To set (something) up,” or “to set up (something),” is a phrasal verb meaning to get ready, to prepare.  The “shot” (shot ) here means the photograph, the one photograph you are going to take with your camera.  “Shot” also has other meanings in English, none of which are found in this week’s Learning Guide!  Katrina says, “I have to do something.  Thi s is boring!”  This is uninteresting; she’s just standing there waiting for Ryan to take the picture.

Ryan says, “I almost have the settings right.”  A “ setting” is an adjustment on a piece of equipment.  It could be, in this case, the  speed that the camera will use; it could be the light; it could be a lot of differe nt things.  Cameras, at least expensive cameras, have many different settings – m any different things you can change on the camera so it’s a better picture.  Rya n says, “I almost have the settings right,” meaning correct, the way I want th em.  He says, “Okay, let’s try a shot (let’s take a picture).  Say ‘cheese.’”  In En glish, if you want someone to smile that’s the expression you use when you’re tak ing a photograph – only when you’re taking a photograph.  You would say, “Okay, everyone say ‘cheese’,” because when you say “cheese,” the mouth has to ope n and you can see the person’s teeth and it looks like they’re smiling ev en if they’re not.

Katrina says, “Cheese.”  Ryan says, “Oh, you look w ashed out in that shot.” When you say someone looks “washed (washed) out” in  a photograph, you mean they don’t seem to have very much color; perhaps th ere’s too much light and you can’t really see the person very well.  Ryan says it’s also blurry.  “Blurry” (blurry) is when a photograph is not in focus.  That is, it’ s not sharp; it looks like someone was moving the camera right when the picture was be ing taken, and so the lines aren’t clear.  They’re not sharp; they’re not in fo cus.

Ryan says, “I think the flash came on when I didn’t  want it to.”  A “flash” (flash) is the part of the camera that shows light on the pers on as you are taking the picture.  So a bright light comes on right when you  take the picture so that when you take the picture you can see what you are takin g the photograph of.  But of course, if you don’t need the light and you have the flash on that may make the person look a little washed out.

Ryan also says that Katrina has red-eye.  “Red-eye”  means just what it sounds like.  The eyes in the photograph look red, and thi s is sometimes caused when people are too close to the flash of the camera, an d it’s a problem because it makes the person look like there’s something wrong with them.  Ryan says, “I’ll have to adjust the settings again.”  “To adjust” (a djust) means to change, to change something to improve it: “I need adjust the settings.”

Katrina says, “Hurry up!”  Go faster, she’s saying.   Ryan says, “Okay, I think I’ve got it now (meaning I think it’s ready).  Get back into your pose.”  A “pose” (pose) is when you move your body into a certain position and you hold it there for a photograph or a painting.  So, Ryan tells Katrina t o get back into her pose.  “Lift your head a little,” he says, “to the side and face  the sun.”  “Lift” means to raise, to move the head into a higher position from a lowe r one.  “Face” means to look toward, to be in a position where your face is towa rd a certain thing, in this case the sun.  You may say to someone – your son or daug hter who isn’t listening to you – you may say, “Face me and listen to what I’m telling you.”  “Face me” means turn around so that your face is looking at m ine.

Katrina says, “Take the picture!”  Ryan says, “I ju st need to focus.”  “To focus” means to adjust the camera, usually the lens of the  camera – the part of the camera that has glass in it that the picture is tak en through, and you change the glass – you change the lens so that the lines are s harp so that the picture isn’t blurry.  You can see the person; they look like wha t they’re supposed to look like.

Ryan says he needs to focus.  “There!” he says.  No tice the use of the word “there,” it just means he’s ready; what he did is n ow correct.  Then he says to Katrina, “Say ‘cheese’ again,” and Katrina says, “C heese.”  But Ryan says, “It’s

still not perfect.  Let me put the camera on a trip od.”  A “tripod” (tripod) is something that has three legs, and if you’ve work w ith a camera you know that you can put the camera on this special stand and th at will keep the camera from moving.  That stand – that thing you put it on – ha s three legs so that it’s stable – it doesn’t move, it keeps still – and that’s called  a tripod.  “Tri,” of course, means three.

So Ryan’s going to put the camera on tripod, and he  tells Katrina, “Try to stay still while I do that.”  Katrina says, “I thought you wan ted this shot to look like a candid.”  A “candid” (candid) means a candid photog raph, and “candid” means informal.  It’s when you’re not posing; you’re not putting your body in a certain position or you’re not looking at the camera and sm iling just because someone is taking your picture.  You’re sort of doing what you  normally do, and while you do that someone takes a picture of you.  There are oth er meanings of “candid.” Those can be found in, of course, the Learning Guid e.

Ryan says he does want the shot to look like a cand id, but he says, “how am I supposed to make it look like a perfect candid if y ou keep moving out of your pose?”  Well, this doesn’t make any sense, because a candid doesn’t have a pose.  So Ryan obviously doesn’t understand the mea ning of the word “candid,” and he should definitely take a look at our Learning Guide!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ryan:  Stop mugging for the camera and stand still!

Katrina:  I’ve been standing still for 10 minutes, while you’ve been setting up the shot.  I have to do something.  This is boring!

Ryan:  I almost have the settings right.  Okay, let ’s try a shot.  Say “cheese.”

Katrina:  Cheese.

Ryan:  Oh, you look washed out in that shot and it’ s blurry.  I think the flash came on when I didn’t want it to.  You have red-eye, too .  I’ll have to adjust the settings again.

Katrina:  Hurry up!

Ryan:  Okay, I think I’ve got it now.  Get back int o your pose.  Lift your head a little to the side and face the sun…

Katrina:  Take the picture!

Ryan:  I just need to focus.  There!  Say “cheese” again.

Katrina:  Cheese.

Ryan:  Um, it’s still not perfect.  Let me put the camera on a tripod.  Try to stay still while I do that.

Katrina:  I thought you wanted the shot to look lik e a candid.

Ryan:  I do, but how am I supposed to make it look like a perfect candid if you keep moving out of your pose?

She never mugs for the camera, but she does write w onderful scripts.  Thank you, Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Business Zoning

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 792: Business Zoning.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 792.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Please go and become a member of ESL Podcast, you’ll be happy you did!

This episode is about the exciting world of busines s zoning.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sybil:  Oh, this is it!  This is the perfect locati on for our new store!

Leo:  Sorry, but this space isn’t zoned for retail.   It’s zoned for offices.

Sybil:  But couldn’t we get the zoning commission t o re-zone it?

Leo:  That’s not an easy process.  The city’s urban  planners decided that this space would be best suited for offices.  Changing t heir minds won’t be easy.

Sybil:  I’ve heard that a lot of new developments a re being zoned for mixed-use. That’s all we need to do.  We just need this buildi ng to be re-zoned for mixed- use.  Then, we can use the space downstairs for com mercial purposes and use the upstairs space for offices or even housing.

Leo:  This area was zoned for industrial purposes o ver 30 years ago.  It took 10 years for it to be re-zoned for offices.  It may ta ke another 10 years to get it re- zoned for commercial purposes.  Do you think you ca n wait 10 years to open your store?

Sybil:  No, I guess not.  What if I rented this spa ce for an office and then ran my store out of it?

Leo:  You’ll never get a business license for your store if you do that.  Each type of zoning has different ordinances and the inspecto r won’t be fooled.

Sybil:  All right.  I’ll look for another space, bu t nothing will live up to this one.

 Leo:  That’s the spirit!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is about business zoning.  A “zone” (z one) is an area or a place; we might use the word “district.”  It’s a certain area  usually within a larger area, such as a city.  This episode talks about “business zoni ng,” which are the laws that the government has about what kind of buildings you can  put in one part of the city, and what buildings you can’t put there.  It will be come a little more clear as we explain the dialogue, I hope.

The dialogue begins with Sybil saying, “Oh, this is  it!  This is the perfect location for our new store!”  It’s the perfect place for the  new store that Sybil and someone else, maybe Leo, is going to open.  Leo say s, “Sorry, but this space isn’t zoned for retail.”  Here, “zone” is used as a  verb.  “To be zoned” means that the government, usually the local government – the city government permits or allows you to put a certain kind of building or a c ertain kind of business in this area of the city.  In the U.S., in most cities ther e are certain places in the city where you can have houses and apartments, others wh ere you can have stores, other places where you can have factories – busines ses that make things, and so forth.  Sometimes you can have all three of thos e in one area, but not always, and that’s what we mean when we say an area is “zon ed for” something.  Here, Leo says the space isn’t zoned for retail.  “Retail ” (retail) is the sale of things, the sale of products and services.  Basically, it’s a s tore that you can go in and buy something from; that’s retail.  So this area, the b uilding where Sybil wants to put the new store, isn’t zoned for retail.  You cannot put a store there; the city won’t allow you.  Leo says, “It’s zoned for offices,” bus iness offices, places that people aren’t coming in to buy things, but places where pe ople work but don’t sell their products right there.

Sybil says, “But couldn’t we get the zoning commiss ion to re-zone it?”  The “zoning commission” would be the group of people – the group of government officials that decides whether or not you can have a certain kind of business. They’re the people in the government that decide wh at can go where in a city. “To re-zone” would mean, of course, to zone again, to change the law so that now you can allow, in this case, retail for that sp ace – for that place.

Leo says, “That’s not an easy process,” meaning re- zoning is not an easy process.  “The city’s urban planners decided that t his space (this area) would be best suited for offices.”  “Urban” (urban) means the city.  “Urban planners” are the people who plan cities, who plan where things go.  The whole idea of urban

planning is something that is popular – has been po pular in the United States.  Of course, we’re a newer country, and newer areas – ne wer cities are being built all the time.  Well, not so much recently, but in the p ast 50 years many cities have grown and, therefore, we need a group of people to decide, well, where should certain things in the local area, and that’s what u rban planners do.  Leo says, “The urban planners decided that this space would b e best suited for offices.” The expression “best suited” means most appropriate  for, something that would be the best use of this area.  He says changing the  urban planners’ minds won’t be easy.  “To change (someone’s) mind” means to get  them to change their idea, to change their opinion.

Sybil says, “I’ve heard that a lot of new developme nts are being zoned for mixed- use.”  The word “development” has a lot of differen t meanings; it could mean change or growth in something.  But here, it’s used  as a noun to refer to a group of new buildings, either houses, or offices, or per haps both.  “Mixed-use” means that you have one building that has more than one t ype of use.  Maybe on the top of the building there are apartments, and then on t he first floor – what we call in the United States the first floor, which is the gro und floor – you may have stores or offices or something else.  So you have more tha n one kind of use in the same building, that would be a mixed-use building or a m ixed-use development. “Development” usually refers to a group of building s, not just one building.  Sybil says, “That’s all we need to do.  We just need this  building to be re-zoned for mixed-use.  Then, we can use the space downstairs ( the area downstairs) for commercial purposes and use the upstairs (the secon d, third, fourth floor) for offices or even housing.”  “Commercial” refers to b usiness.  So what Sybil is saying is that they can have the building re-zoned so that the first floor – the ground floor can be used for her store, which would  be a commercial purpose, and the other floors – the upstairs, in this case –  could be used for offices or even housing.

But, Leo says, “This area was zoned for industrial purposes over 30 years ago.” The word “industrial” (industrial) refers to making  things, producing actual physical goods.  It’s a type of commercial activity , but it’s a specific type.  It’s one usually involved in manufacturing something – makin g something, not just selling a service.  And, once again, this is sometimes a se parate zoning classification. You can only have buildings where people are making  things in certain parts of the city.  “This area,” Leo says, “was zoned for in dustrial purposes 30 years ago (over 30 years ago, more than 30 years ago).  It to ok 10 years for it to be re- zoned for offices.  It may take another 10 years to  get it re-zoned for commercial purposes.  Do you think you can wait 10 years to op en your store?”  Leo is saying it’s going to take a long time to get this r e-zoned.  Like a lot of things in

government, it takes a long time for the government  to take action.  That’s true with any big institution – any big organization.

Sybil says, “No, I guess not.”  I can’t wait 10 yea rs.  She says, “What if I rented this space for an office then ran my store out of it?”  She’s saying well, I’ll say I’m going to open an office, but in fact I’ll have a st ore.  That’s what she means when she says “run” her store out of it.  “To run,” here , means to operate or manage a business.  “Out of it” means in that space, in that  area.

Leo says, “You’ll never get a business license for your store if you do that.”  In most cities, you need a license to have your busine ss there.  Basically, it’s a way of the – for the city make you pay taxes for having  your business in that city.  The license is your permission to work and have a busin ess there.  Leo says that Sybil won’t get a business license if she tries to run her store out of a space that is zoned for an office.  “Each type of zoning,” he says, “has different ordinances and the inspector won’t be fooled.”  An “ordinance”  (ordinance) here means a law or a regulation, a rule that the government has.  A n “inspector” is someone who goes around making sure that businesses are followi ng the law, that they’re doing what they’re supposed to do.  “To be fooled” means to trick someone, to make them believe something that isn’t true.

Leo says that the inspector won’t be fooled by Sybi l’s idea of running her store out of an office; he won’t allow it, or she won’t a llow it.  Sybil says, “All right (okay).  I’ll look for another space.”  Notice we u se the word “space” typically when we are talking about an area that you rent or that you own for business purposes.  Sometimes people use that word to descri be a room in their house or an area in their house; it can be used in a lot of different ways.  Sybil says, “I’ll look for another space, but nothing will live up to  this one.”  “To live up to (something)” is a phrasal expression meaning to be as good as, or to seem as good as or better than.  “He lived up to his reputa tion as a funny person,” meaning he was actually as funny as people said he was; he lived up to that. You could say, “This meal did not live up to my exp ectations.”  I thought this food was going to be better from this restaurant, but it  wasn’t.

Of course, Sybil is being pessimistic here; she’s b eing negative.  She doesn’t think any other place will be as good as this one.  Leo says, jokingly, “That’s the spirit!”  That expression, “that’s the spirit,” is used usually in a sarcastic or ironic way.  You would think that “that’s the spirit” woul d be a positive thing, and it is, that it means that’s the right attitude, you have t he right motivation.  But it’s usually used when someone’s being negative and you’ re sort of making fun of them.  “Oh, I’ll never – I’ll never be able to get a date with that beautiful woman,” and your friend says, “Well, that’s the spirit,” me aning, of course, you’re being too

negative.  You should be positive instead of negati ve about your chances. Though, probably you – you won’t actually get a dat e with the beautiful woman, so maybe look somewhere else!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sybil:  Oh, this is it!  This is the perfect locati on for our new store!

Leo:  Sorry, but this space isn’t zoned for retail.   It’s zoned for offices.

Sybil:  But couldn’t we get the zoning commission t o re-zone it?

Leo:  That’s not an easy process.  The city’s urban  planners decided that this space would be best suited for offices.  Changing t heir minds won’t be easy.

Sybil:  I’ve heard that a lot of new developments a re being zoned for mixed-use. That’s all we need to do.  We just need this buildi ng to be re-zoned for mixed- use.  Then, we can use the space downstairs for com mercial purposes and use the upstairs space for offices or even housing.

Leo:  This area was zoned for industrial purposes o ver 30 years ago.  It took 10 years for it to be re-zoned for offices.  It may ta ke another 10 years to get it re- zoned for commercial purposes.  Do you think you ca n wait 10 years to open your store?

Sybil:  No, I guess not.  What if I rented this spa ce for an office and then ran my store out of it?

Leo:  You’ll never get a business license for your store if you do that.  Each type of zoning has different ordinances and the inspecto r won’t be fooled.

Sybil:  All right.  I’ll look for another space, bu t nothing will live up to this one.

Leo:  That’s the spirit!

# Signing Professional Athletes

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 793: Signing Professional Athletes.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 793.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  If you want to support this podcast, if you want to keep us going into the future become a member, help  support us by becoming a Learning Guide member or by purchasing one of our c ourses on our website.

This episode is a dialogue between Nick and Jamie.  It’s going to be about when you have a professional athlete – a professional sp orts player who joins a team. “To sign them” means to get them to become a member  of that team.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nick:  I don’t care what it takes.  I want Robinson  on my team next year.

Jamie:  He’ll be a free agent and he’ll be fielding  a lot of offers.  I don’t know if we can make him an attractive enough deal.

Nick:  We’ll offer him a signing bonus.  That shoul d sweeten the deal.

Jamie:  I’m afraid that may not be enough.  Don’t f orget that he was a first-round pick in the draft.

Nick:  Then we’ll give him a no-trade clause.  With  that, he’ll be calling the shots and won’t have to worry about being traded to a tea m he doesn’t want to be on. He should be happy with that.

Jamie:  I don’t know.  His agent expects a lot of c ompeting offers.  We’ll have to pull out all the stops if we want to land him.

Nick:  Then we’ll do it.  We won’t be bested by any  other team.

Jamie:  Like last year.

Nick:  Last year?  Don’t remind me of last year!

 [end of dialogue]

This episode is called “Signing Professional Athlet es.”  “To sign (someone)” means to get them to become a member of your organi zation, usually your team. The verb is used in this sense when we talk about p rofessional sports players – professional athletes.

Nick says, “I don’t care what it takes (I don’t care how much money we have to spend).  I want Robinson on my team next year.”  Ja mie says, “He’ll be a free agent and he’ll be fielding a lot of offers.”  A “f ree agent” is when you have a sports player – an athlete who doesn’t have a contr act with a team, or his contract is over and now he can sign a contract wit h whomever he wants; that’s a free agent.  “Fielding” comes from the verb “to fie ld” (field), and that means to receive and have to respond to.  Usually we use thi s verb when people are asking questions.  The person who answers the quest ions fields the questions; he or she takes the questions and tries to answer t hem.  But you could also use the verb, as it is in this dialogue, to mean look a t, evaluate, accept, or reject offers to come to a certain team or a certain compa ny.  When we say a player is “fielding offers,” we mean that many different team s are sending him or her ideas – proposals to get the person to sign with their te am.  An “offer” is a proposal: “Here’s how much money we will pay you if you play for our team.”

Jamie says, “I don’t know if we can make him an att ractive enough deal.” “Attractive” is something that he would like.  “Att ractive” can also mean beautiful; we say “she’s an attractive woman,” we mean she’s a  good-looking or beautiful woman.  But you can use the word also as an adjecti ve to describe things that are desirable, that people would want.

Jamie doesn’t know if the team Nick and Jamie for w ork for or own can make this can make this athlete an attractive enough deal – s ufficiently attractive.  A “deal” means an agreement basically, a contract.  Nick say s, “We’ll offer him a signing bonus.”  A “bonus” (bonus) is something additional,  something extra.  Often when you have professional athletes, especially when the y are young, they’re just coming out of college or sometimes high school, you  want them to play for your team so you’ll pay them a regular salary, but you’l l also give them a bunch of money as a bonus.  So, sometimes good professional athletes in baseball, for example, can get maybe a million or two million dol lars if they’re really good as a signing bonus.  You sign the contract and they imme diately give you a million dollars.  That’s how they got me to work here at ES L Podcast.  I got a huge signing bonus.  I think it was 10 dollars, somethin g like that!  Anyway, Nick says that they’re going to offer a signing a deal to thi s athlete.  Nick says, “That should

sweeten the deal.”  “To sweeten the deal” means to make an offer more attractive: “We offer you a million dollars and a b rand-new car.”  The car sweetens the deal; it makes it even more desirable – if you want a car.  I guess it depends on the car, too.

Jamie says, “I’m afraid that may not be enough (she  doesn’t think that will be sufficiently attractive).  Don’t forget that he was  a first-round pick in the draft.”  A “draft” (draft), when we talk about sports, is a sy stem that many professional sport organizations use to select new players, high  school or college graduates, young players who have not played for anyone else y et.  This is their first time as a professional player.  There’s a system called the  “draft,” basically what happens is you have all these different teams, mayb e 25-30-40 teams throughout the whole country; they may be football teams, they  may be baseball teams, and all of the young new players have to register for t his draft, if you will.  Then all the teams get together in a big meeting, and they go ar ound in a circle basically, and they say, “Okay, you get to pick one player,” and t hen each team gets to pick one player so that not all of the best players will go to a single team.  And after everyone gets one pick – one selection, then they s tart again.  The first selection – the first picks is called the “first round,” and then you have second round, third round, fourth round.  So for example, the Los Angel es Dodgers will get one first- round pick; every team gets one first-round pick, u nless there are certain cases where they don’t, but usually they do.  Then, they get a second-round pick, and a third-round pick, and so forth.  So that’s the syst em that’s used so that the good players go to different teams, so the teams are mor e competitive; they’re more or less equal in terms of their talent.  Well, the pla yer that Nick and Jamie are interested was a first-round pick in the draft, mea ning he was one of the best players when he first started.

Nick says, “Then we’ll give him a no-trade clause.”   A “clause” (clause) is part of a contract; it’s a paragraph or a section or perhap s even just a sentence in a contract – an official agreement.  “To trade a play er” means to sell the player to another team.  So a “no-trade clause” means that the team can’t trade the player, can’t say, “Okay, we’re going to send you to the Bo ston Red Sox, you’re not going to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers anymore,”  which is probably a good thing this year because, you know, the team isn’t t hat good this year.  Anyway, so you trade that player.  Well, the player might h ave a no-trade clause that says, “No, you can’t trade me because I don’t want to go to Boston.  It’s too cold there!” So, you can say no.  Only the very best players can  get a no-trade clause, so they can determine where they go and where they don ’t go.  Nick says with a no- trade clause this athlete will be calling the shots  and won’t have to worry about being traded to a team he doesn’t want to be on.  T he expression “to call the shots” means to have the power to say what will hap pen; you’re the person who’s

making the decision.  “Who’s calling the shots here ?”  Who is the person in charge?  Who is the person who’s making the decisio ns?  Not me, I can tell you that much!  Well, Nick says that with this no-trade  clause the player will be calling the shots, they will decide where they play.  They won’t have to worry about being traded to another team.  “Traded” means basic ally they sell you to another team, or they give you to another team and then the y get another player back for you, and that happens all the time in professional sports in the United States.

Nick says the player should be happy with that.  Ja mie says, “I don’t know.  His agent expects a lot of competing offers.”  The “age nt” is the representative, the person who takes care of the contracts, often a law yer.  Every professional athlete has an agent.  Actors and actresses also ha ve agents; they are not smart enough to do things themselves – no, I’m just kiddi ng!  They’re smart enough, some of them, but they’re very busy and, of course,  you want to have someone who’s an expert in law – in contracts to be taking care of your legal business, and it is, after all, a contract for working.  So, athl etes have agents, and the agents may get different offers from different teams; we m ight call those “competing” offers, because more than one team is competing for  that player – they both want to get that player.  Jamie says, “We’ll have to pul l out all the stops if we want to land him.”  The expression “to pull out all the sto ps,” or “pull out all of the stops,” means to do everything possible, to do everything y ou possibly can.  The expression actually comes from music, from playing an organ, where if you want the organ to play louder you would pull out all of the stops.  We won’t talk about organs right now, but the expression means to do ev erything possible.  Jamie says they’re going to have to pull out all the stop s if we want to land him.  “To land,” as a verb, here means to get something that is very valuable and very difficult to get.  “Land,” however, has a lot of di fferent meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some of those.

Nick says, “Then we’ll do it.  We won’t be bested b y any other team.”  “To be bested (bested) by (someone)” means to be defeated by or to be beaten by someone else.  Jamie says, “Like last year.”  Nick says, “Last year?  Don’t remind me of last year!”  We can guess that somethi ng bad happened last year. They didn’t get the player that they wanted, they w ere bested or beaten by another team.  Well, Nick says this year that’s not  going to happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nick:  I don’t care what it takes.  I want Robinson  on my team next year.

Jamie:  He’ll be a free agent and he’ll be fielding  a lot of offers.  I don’t know if we can make him an attractive enough deal.

Nick:  We’ll offer him a signing bonus.  That shoul d sweeten the deal.

Jamie:  I’m afraid that may not be enough.  Don’t f orget that he was a first-round pick in the draft.

Nick:  Then we’ll give him a no-trade clause.  With  that, he’ll be calling the shots and won’t have to worry about being traded to a tea m he doesn’t want to be on. He should be happy with that.

# Getting Over a Fight

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 794: Getting Over a Fight.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 794.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there, become a memb er, support this podcast, keep us going.

This episode is a dialogue about two people who got  into an argument, what we might call a “fight.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alisa:  Don’t be mad.

Sabir:  I’m not mad.

Alisa:  Yes, you are.  I’m sorry.  I admit it was m y fault.  Will you stop moping now?

Sabir:  I’m not moping.  I’m giving you the silent treatment.

Alisa:  I knew it!  You’re still peeved at me.  Wha t can I do to make it up to you?

Sabir:  You can leave me alone.

Alisa:  If I leave you alone to stew, you’ll replay  the whole incident in your head and the next thing I know, you’ll hold a grudge aga inst me.  Won’t you just forgive me so we can move on?

Sabir:  What you said wasn’t just a slight.  It was  an out-and-out insult.

Alisa:  I know it was and I’m truly sorry.  I’ll bu y you lunch at your favorite restaurant to show you how contrite I am.

Sabir:  And you won’t say it again?

Alisa:  I promise I’ll never tell you again in fron t of your friends how much you look like Elvis – in his later years.

[end of dialogue]

Alisa says to Sabir, “Don’t be mad.”  Don’t be angr y; don’t be upset.  Sabir says, “I’m not mad.”  Alisa says, “Yes, you are.  I’m sor ry.  I admit it was my fault.”  “To admit” (admit) means to say something is true even though you don’t want to say it’s true, because it’s embarrassing or perhaps you  did something wrong and you don’t want to say you did something wrong, but you have to – you admit it.  “To admit” can also be to say something that perhaps yo u’re not proud of, you’re embarrassed about.  “Admit” has a couple of other m eanings in English as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.

Alisa admits that something was her fault (fault).  “Fault” is responsibility for something bad that has happened.  “Whose fault was it?”  “It was his fault,” he is the person who caused the problem.  Alisa says, “Wi ll you stop moping now?” “To mope” (mope) is to be sad, to be depressed; it’ s also something that a child might do after the child has been yelled at and the n the child is angry, and he’ll go around with a big, sad face and let everyone kno w that he’s sad – that he’s angry.  It’s a negative thing, “to mope,” it means to continue to show how upset or depressed you are to everyone else, even though you should hide that or perhaps simply get over it – stop worrying about it .

Sabir says, “I’m not moping.  I’m giving you the si lent treatment.”  “To give (someone) the silent treatment” means not to speak to someone, to refuse to talk to someone as a way of punishing them, as a way of expressing your anger or your disappointment in them.

Alisa says, “I knew it!  You’re still peeved at me. ”  “To be peeved” (peeved) means to be angry, to be upset, to be mad.  Alisa s ays, “What can I do to make it up to you?”  “To make (something) up to (someone)” is to do something nice for another person after you have done something wrong or after you have hurt them or made them angry or upset.  We might use thi s expression, for example, in the case of a father who is supposed to go to hi s daughter’s softball game, and the daughter is very upset when the father can’t ma ke it – doesn’t go to the game.  The father then says to the daughter, “Let m e make it up to you.  Let’s go get some ice cream.”  Or, “Let’s go to McDonald’s a nd eat some terrible food. Let me make it up to you.”  Let me do something nic e for you that will somehow make you forgive me and forget what I did.

Sabir says to Alisa, “You can leave me alone.”  “To  leave (someone) alone” means not to talk to them, not to be with them.  Al isa says, “If I leave you alone to stew, you’ll replay the whole incident in your head .”  “To stew” (stew) here means to think about something over and over again in you r mind, something that’s negative, something that makes you angry or upset.  We usually use this when someone is angry: “He was stewing in his anger.”  H e was thinking about it and getting more and more angry.  Alisa says that Sabir  will stew and replay the whole incident in his head.  “To replay” means to p lay again.  Normally we use this in talking about listening to a piece of music  or maybe watching a DVD, you’re going to replay a section.  Or if you’re wat ching sports on television and someone makes a good play in a soccer game or a bas eball game, they will replay that part of the game; you will see it again .  We usually call this “instant replay,” they play it over right away, instantly.  Here, “to replay” something means to think about it again and again.  It’s as though you had a DVD player in your head.  Actually, that would be kind of cool, to hav e a DVD player!  You could just put the DVD on top of your head and then…yeah, I li ke that!  Somebody work on that!

Anyway, Alisa says that Sabir will stew and replay the whole incident.  An “incident” (incident) is an event, usually somethin g bad or unpleasant that happens, something that perhaps is embarrassing.  S o, it’s a negative thing, an “incident.”  Don’t confuse this word with “accident ” (accident); an accident is something bad that happens that you didn’t want to happen, that happened not on purpose.  So, an accident could also be an incid ent, but they’re two different ideas.

Well, Alisa says that Sabir will replay the whole, or entire, or complete incident in his head.  “And the next thing I know,” Alisa says,  “you’ll hold a grudge against me.”  A “grudge” (grudge) is when you are angry at someone for a long time; you don’t forget about it.  It could go for days or wee ks or months or even years, where you continue to be angry about something that  someone did to you. Notice the verb we use with this word is “hold,” “t o hold a grudge.”  “Don’t hold a grudge against me.”  Alisa says, “Won’t you just fo rgive me so we can move on?” “To forgive (someone)” is to no longer be angry at someone who did something bad to you.  You hurt me some way, but I forgive yo u.  It’s always better to forgive, otherwise that person continues to hurt yo u because you continue to be bothered by it.  At least that’s what I try to do, but that’s not easy to do.  “To forgive and forget,” we sometimes say.  Well, Alisa  asks Sabir to forgive her, “so we can move on.”  “To move on” here means to forget  about something bad that happened in the past and continue forward – continu e without thinking about the bad things that happened in the past

Sabir says, “What you said wasn’t just a slight.”  A “slight” (slight) is when you insult someone, but it’s not a big insult; when you  say something negative or criticize someone, but it’s not a major criticism, it’s not like you’re saying they’re the ugliest person in the world.  You might say, “W ell, you’re not the best looking person in the world,” that would be a slight.  I gu ess some people would say that’s an insult – a serious insult.  But a slight is less serious.  Sabir says this was not a slight, what Alisa said, “It was an out-and-o ut insult.”  An “insult” is when you say something negative, something critical abou t someone else, saying that they’re stupid or they’re ugly or whatever.  “Out-a nd-out” here means completely, absolutely, without any question.  We might use thi s expression to talk about someone who is a liar: “He’s and out-and-out liar.”   Or, “That’s an out-and-out lie,” it’s a complete lie.  Why do we say “out-and- out”?  I don’t know, but that’s the expression we use.

Alisa says, “I know it was (I know it was an insult ) and I’m truly sorry.”  She says, “I’ll buy you lunch at your favorite restaurant to show you how contrite I am.”  “To be contrite” (contrite) means to be sorry for somet hing you have done, to feel sorry for something bad you did.  Sabir says, “And you won’t say it again?”  Alisa says, “I promise I’ll never tell you again in front  of your friends how much you look like Elvis (Elvis the singer) – in his later y ears.”  Well of course, Elvis, as he got older, got fatter and uglier, and to say someon e looks like Elvis in his later years, when he was older, is certainly an insult.  Now, if you said someone looked like Elvis in his younger years, when he was  considered a good-looking man back in the 50s and 60s – early 60s, well, that  would be different.  “In front of” means when your friends are present or when som eone is there in the room. So Alisa said something in front of Sabir’s friends , meaning his friends were there and they could hear what she was saying.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alisa:  Don’t be mad.

Sabir:  I’m not mad.

Alisa:  Yes, you are.  I’m sorry.  I admit it was m y fault.  Will you stop moping now?

Sabir:  I’m not moping.  I’m giving you the silent treatment.

Alisa:  I knew it!  You’re still peeved at me.  Wha t can I do to make it up to you?

 Sabir:  You can leave me alone.

Alisa:  If I leave you alone to stew, you’ll replay  the whole incident in your head and the next thing I know, you’ll hold a grudge aga inst me.  Won’t you just forgive me so we can move on?

Sabir:  What you said wasn’t just a slight.  It was  an out-and-out insult.

Alisa:  I know it was and I’m truly sorry.  I’ll bu y you lunch at your favorite restaurant to show you how contrite I am.

Sabir:  And you won’t say it again?

Alisa:  I promise I’ll never tell you again in fron t of your friends how much you look like Elvis – in his later years.

This episode is about ordering coffee and tea.  I t hink I’ve had a little too much coffee this morning, but we’ll go ahead and start t he dialogue now.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jermaine:  I’d like a decaf drip, to go.

Drew:  Would you like our light or dark roast?

Jermaine:  I’ll just have whatever’s freshly brewed .

Drew:  Are you sure you don’t want to try an espres so, an Americano, or a latte?

Jermaine:  No, just a decaf coffee.

Drew:  Sure, no problem.  Would you like it hot or cold?

Jermaine:  Hot, please.

Drew:  Would you like any room for cream?

Jermaine:  No, thanks.

Drew:  Would you like some sweetener?  A couple of pumps of syrup maybe?

Jermaine:  No, I’ll add a couple of packets of suga r myself.

 Drew:  Oh, I’m sorry.  I added some foam from anoth er drink to your coffee by accident.  I’ll have to start over.  Did you say yo u wanted the light or dark roast?

Jermaine:  Forget it.  Let’s keep it simple.  Give me a cup of tea.

Drew:  Would you like that hot or cold, sweetened o r unsweetened, loose leaf or in a tea bag?

[end of dialogue]

This dialogue is about two of my favorite topics: c offee and tea.  I’m not sure if I mentioned, but recently I started drinking coffee a gain.  Now, those of you who’ve listened to many of our podcasts know that I ’m usually – or have been, I should say, a tea drinker.  I particularly like the  Starbucks tea, the Vente Earl Grey Latte at seven pumps of vanilla, nonfat, no fo am.  However, more recently I’ve gone back to drinking coffee again.  It used t o bother my stomach, but for some reason, maybe I’m getting older and my stomach  doesn’t care anymore, but I’ve been able to drink coffee a lot more.  So,  I’m very excited about this episode, talking about coffee and tea.

Jermaine begins by saying, “I’ll have a decaf drip,  to go.”  Now Jermaine is at a café or a coffee shop or a coffee house, a place wh ere you would buy coffee and tea, so he’s ordering a cup of coffee.  He says he wants a decaf drip, to go. “Decaf” is short for “decaffeinated,” that’s when y ou drink coffee that doesn’t have the caffeine that gets you awake or, for some people, overly excited.  I don’t drink decaf coffee, unless it’s late at night and I  know I need to go to sleep soon. “Coffee,” of course, is a drink made from putting h ot water through grounded coffee beans.  When we say something is “to go” we mean we are going to take it with us, we’re not going to drink it there at the café.  In the United States, it’s very popular to get coffee to go; in other countrie s, it’s not as popular.  But in the U.S., many, many people, maybe most people who go t o a café or to a place like Starbucks get their drink to go, meaning they have a plastic or a paper cup and they’re able to take the drink with them in their c ar or wherever they’re going. “Drip” (drip) refers to coffee that is made usually  in someone’s home, but in a Starbucks or in a café a drip coffee is the coffee that they’ve already made.  It’s usually coffee that has been made in the last 30 to  60 minutes; it’s not coffee that they have to make specially for you.  It usually ch anges; the kind of coffee changes every day depending on the café you go to.  But a “drip coffee” is just the regular coffee, whatever it is that they’re ser ving today; you’re not asking for anything special.

So Jermaine asks for a decaf drip, to go.  Drew say s, “Would you like our light or dark roast?”  The “roast” (roast) is how long the c offee beans have been cooked over a hot fire, and usually when you roast the cof fee beans for a long time the beans get dark and it gives the coffee a different taste – a different flavor.  You can have a dark roasted coffee, a medium roasted co ffee, and a light roasted coffee, and the light roast doesn’t have as strong of a taste as the darker roast.

Jermaine says, “I’ll have whatever’s freshly brewed .”  “To brew (brew) coffee” means to mix the coffee with hot water.  We might a lso talk about brewing beer, but that’s when you have a different process of boi ling some liquid in the process of making beer.  But when we’re brewing coffee, it just means adding the hot water to the coffee or pouring the hot water throug h the coffee, which is the way it’s usually done.  Jermaine says he wants whatever ’s “freshly” brewed – recently brewed.

Drew says, “Are you sure you don’t want to try an e spresso, an Americano, or a latte?”  These three words: “espresso” (which many Americans pronounce “expresso ” as though there were an “x” in there but there is n’t), “Americano,” and “latte” are Italian words, because the Italians, ma ny people believe, have some of the best coffee or prepare some of the best coffee in the world.  An “espresso” is a very dark, strong coffee that is made by pushing hot water through the coffee very quickly in a special machine called an “espres so machine.”  Nowadays, many people have espresso machines in their houses.   I have one, but I don’t usually drink espresso.  An “Americano” is a drink made by taking the espresso and adding some additional hot water so that it isn ’t quite as strong.  In many countries, in Italy for example, when you order a c offee you’ll get an espresso. So if you want something more like an American coff ee you have to ask for an Americano.  A “latte” is coffee with milk; “latte” is the Italian word for milk.  In this case it’s hot milk – steamed milk, and usually you add what are called “shots” of espresso.  A “shot” is just a small amount of liqui d.

But Jermaine doesn’t want any of that.  He says, “N o, just a decaf coffee.”  “Drew says, “Sure, no problem.  Would you like it hot or cold?”  Some people like cold coffee.  Jermaine says, “Hot, please.”  Drew then s ays, “Would you like any room for cream?”  “Cream” (cream) is something that come s from a cow; it has a lot of fat in it.  It is the part of the milk that rises t o the top of a milk container from cow’s milk, so it’s sort of a very fatty kind of mi lk.  It’s a liquid that people often put in coffee; sometimes they just put in milk – re gular milk.  “Room” means space.  In this case, when someone says “I want roo m for cream,” they mean they want the person working at the café, sometimes  called a “barista,” to pour the coffee in a cup but leave room in the cup for s ome cream, and then the customer, the person buying the coffee, can add the  amount of cream or milk

that they want.  In many cafés you can just say, “I ’d like a coffee with room,” and you don’t even have to say “room for cream,” they u nderstand what you mean. So if you really want to sound like a native speake r, you go into a café and you say, “Yeah, I’d like a large drip coffee with room,  please,” and they’ll know that you want room for cream so they will leave some ext ra room in the cup.

Jermaine says, “No, thanks.”  He doesn’t want room for cream.  Drew says, “Would you like some sweetener?”  “Sweetener” is so mething that, of course, makes the drink sweeter; sugar is the most obvious kind of way of sweetening a drink.  But nowadays we have artificial sweeteners,  things that kind of taste like sugar; they don’t really, but they make something s weeter.  You can also make something sweeter by putting “syrup” in it, which i s basically a liquid kind of sugar.  Syrup (syrup) comes in many different flavo rs; you could have vanilla syrup, for example, in your coffee.  I don’t like t hat, but some people do.  Drew actually asks Jermaine if he wants a few pumps of s yrup.  A “pump” (pump) is just a small amount of syrup.  It’s the way that th ey measure the amount of syrup in a café, because it comes from a bottle and the b ottle on the top of it has a device called a “pump,” which is what you use to re move liquid from something by drawing it upwards.

Well, Jermaine doesn’t want any syrup.  He says, “I ’ll add a couple of packets of sugar myself.”  A “packet” is a small container of something.  Usually when you go to a café or some restaurants, you will get suga r or sweetener in a “packet,” a little container made out of paper.  Drew says, “Oh , I’m sorry.  I’ve added some foam from another drink to your coffee by accident. ”  “Foam” is when you have a lot of very small “bubbles,” little bits of air in the liquid, and this might happen if you are, for example, steaming the milk.  You are h eating the milk up very quickly by using hot air, and that air produces small bubbl es of air that can cause foam on the top of the milk that you are steaming.  Some  people, when they have a latte drink or a drink with milk in it, don’t want the foam.  But Drew has accidentally added foam to Jermaine’s drink.  She t ells Jermaine that she’ll start over, she’ll make his drink again.  She says, “Did you say you wanted the light or dark roast?”

Jermaine says, “Forget it.  Let’s keep it simple.  Give me a cup of tea.”  Drew says, “Would you like that hot or cold, sweetened o r unsweetened, loose leaf or in a tea bag?”  There are different ways of prepari ng tea, just as there are different ways of preparing coffee: hot and cold, s weetened or unsweetened – with sugar or without sugar.  Also, the tea can be put into the hot water directly, or it can be put into a tea bag.  When you use a te a bag, when you’re done making tea, when the tea has been in the hot water long enough you can then pull the tea out easily by just removing the bag.  When you put tea in loose leaf,

that means the tea goes right into the water; there ’s no bag that you can use to take it out when you don’t want it there anymore.  But people who drink their tea with loose leaf tea don’t really care, usually they  just leave it in there until they’re done drinking and then they clean it out later.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jermaine:  I’d like a decaf drip, to go.

Drew:  Would you like our light or dark roast?

Jermaine:  I’ll just have whatever’s freshly brewed .

Drew:  Are you sure you don’t want to try an espres so, an Americano, or a latte?

Jermaine:  No, just a decaf coffee.

Drew:  Sure, no problem.  Would you like it hot or cold?

Jermaine:  Hot, please.

Drew:  Would you like any room for cream?

Jermaine:  No, thanks.

 You don’t need to add sweetener to our dialogues; t hey’re already sweet.  That’s because they’re made by the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.

This episode is a dialogue about setting up or gett ing ready for a conference call and videoconferences.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ewan:  Who’s running the videoconference next week?

Petra:  I am.  Desmond put me in charge of it last week.

Ewan:  Oh, somebody’s moving up in the world.  It’s  nice that he’s giving you more responsibility.

Petra:  Yeah, but I’m not sure I’m ready.

Ewan:  I’ve set up conference calls and videoconfer ences before.  Maybe you can tell me what you’ve already done and I can see if you’ve missed anything.

Petra:  That would be great.  Okay, I’ve scheduled the meeting for 3:00…

Ewan:  Stop right there.  If the videoconference is  at 3:00 here, it’s already 6:00 on the East Coast.  That’s too late to start the me eting, don’t you think?

Petra:  Oh, I didn’t factor in time zones!  But I s till have time to reschedule, I think, so it’s not a total catastrophe.

Ewan:  Good.  Be sure to initiate the call or the c onnection at least 10 minutes before the time of the meeting, and make sure you k now how to reconnect someone if they get disconnected during the meeting .

Petra:  I still need to figure that out.

Ewan:  Are you facilitating the meeting, too?

Petra:  I don’t know.  I guess so.

Ewan:  In that case, make sure you identify each pe rson by greeting them by name.

Petra:  I was hoping to lurk in the background in c ase something went wrong.  I’d be ready to troubleshoot.

Ewan:  If Desmond put you in charge of setting up t he meeting, he’ll want you to take a more active part.

[Petra breathing heavily]

Ewan:  What are you doing?

Petra:  Hyperventilating.  I don’t think I’m ready for this.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ewan saying to Petra, “Who ’s running the videoconference next week?”  “Who’s running” meanin g who’s organizing, who is the person who is managing the videoconference.  A “videoconference” (one word) is a meeting where people in different locati ons, different cities perhaps different countries, talk to each other by using ei ther a telephone line or an Internet line that allows you to see the person lik e you’re talking to them on a television set.  It’s a video of all of the members  who are part of this meeting – this conference.  Petra says, “I am (I’m running the videoconference).  Desmond put me in charge of it last week.”  “To put (someon e) in charge of (something)” means to say that they are going to organize it, th ey are going to run it.

Ewan says, “Oh, somebody’s moving up in the world.”   “To move up in the world” is an expression meaning to be doing well or to be doing better professionally: to be getting more money, more responsibility, a bette r job.  That’s to move up in the world.  Ewan is sort of making a joke here.  Ew an says, “It’s nice that he’s giving you more responsibility.”  Petra says, “Yeah , but I’m not sure I’m ready.” She’s not sure she’s ready for this new responsibil ity.  Don’t worry Petra, you’re ready!  I know you.  Well, I don’t know you because  you don’t exist.  But if you did, you’d be ready.

 Ewan says, “I’ve set up conference calls and videoc onferences before.” “Conference calls” are meetings where, like a video conference, you have people in different places, perhaps in the country or even  in the world, but typically they don’t involve any video.  It’s just the telephone, or nowadays it might be on the Internet using a service like Skype.  So Ewan says that he has set up conference calls and videoconferences before, and we all know what an idiot Ewan is, so if Ewan can do it certainly Petra can do it.  That’s m y opinion.  Ewan says, “Maybe you can tell me what you’ve already done and I can see if you missed anything,” if there’s something you didn’t think of.

Petra said, “That would be great.”  “Okay,” she say s, “I’ve scheduled the meeting for 3:00.”  Ewan says, “Stop right there,” meaning don’t say anything else. Usually we use this expression in a conversation wh en a person has said something that’s either wrong or perhaps not what y ou should be saying or should have done.  So for example, I could say, “We ll, I’m going to Europe.  The first thing I’m going to do is buy myself a little boat so that I can get to Europe,” and someone would say, “Oh, stop right there.  Ther e’s no way you can take a little boat to Europe.  It will take you a very lon g time.”  That’s just an example.

Petra says she wants to schedule the meeting, or ha s scheduled the meeting for 3:00.  Ewan says, “Stop right there.  If the videoc onference is at 3:00 here (meaning if it’s at 3:00 where we are, let’s say Lo s Angeles), it’s already 6:00 on the East Coast,” meaning there’s a time difference between Los Angeles and the East Coast of the United States where New York and Washington and Boston and Atlanta and other big cities are – Philadelphia , and so forth.  Well, she scheduled the meeting at three, but it will already  be 6:00 in New York and, of course, people may have already gone home.

Ewans say, “That’s too late to start the meeting, d on’t you think?”  Petra says, “Oh, I didn’t factor in time zones!”  “To factor (f actor) in” means to consider something in your decision.  If you’re going to tak e a small boat from New York to France, you have to factor in all of the time it’s going to take you to take your boat from one side of the Atlantic to the other.  S o that’s to factor in, to consider. “Time zones” are one of the 24 geographic areas in the world that we divide up into different hours, so that when it is 3:00 in the afternoon here in Los Angeles it’s 4:00 in Las Vegas, it’s 5:00 in Chicago, and it’s 6:00 in New York.  Three o’clock in the afternoon would be, I think, midnigh t in Rome – in central Europe.  I think that’s right.  Anyway, Petra says that she sc heduled this meeting at three, and of course that won’t work.  She says, “I didn’t  factor in time zones.  But I still have time to reschedule (to pick a new time), so it ’s not a total catastrophe,” she says.  A “catastrophe” is a disaster, something tha t is very serious, very negative.

Normally we use this word in talking about an earth quake or a hurricane.  Those would be, well, this would be disasters; if they ca used a lot of damage they could be catastrophes.  Or, if you lose a million dollars , that would be, for most people, a catastrophe.

Ewan says, “Good,” meaning good that you can resche dule it.  He says, “Be sure to initiate (or begin) the call (the telephone call ) or the connection at least 10 minutes before the time of the meeting.”  The “conn ection” would be the connection, in this case, between two or more peopl e; it could be on the Internet, it could be on a telephone line.  Ewan says, “make sure you know how to reconnect someone if they get disconnected during t he meeting.”  So, “to get disconnected” means that, for example, you’re talki ng to someone and then suddenly your phone line stops working, or your Int ernet connection isn’t working and you get disconnected; you are no longer talking  or communicating with that person.  So if that happens, you have to get “recon nected,” connected again.

Petra says, “I still need to figure that out,” mean ing I still need to understand how to do that.  Ewan says, “Are you facilitating the m eeting, too?”  “To facilitate” (facilitate) means, really, to run the meeting, to be the person who is in charge of getting people to accomplish what they’re supposed to accomplish.  Petra says, “I don’t know.  I guess so.”  She’s not sure if she ’s running or facilitating the meeting.  Ewan says, “In that case (in that instanc e), make sure you identify each person by greeting them by name.”  “To greet (greet ) (someone)” means to say hello to someone.  “By name” means you use their na me: “Hello Jeff, hello Petra, hello Newman.”

Petra says, “I was hoping to lurk in the background  in case something went wrong.”  “To lurk” (lurk) means that you are presen t, you are there, but you’re sort of hidden.  Other people aren’t listening to you or  observing you; you’re not participating.  Petra says she wants to lurk in the  background.  The “background” here means in the environment, but not where everyo ne can see her.  “To be in the background” means that no one is really paying attention.  You’re there, you may even be influencing things, but no one sees you , no one talks to you, no one thinks about you.  Petra says, “I’d be ready to tro ubleshoot.”  “To troubleshoot” (one word) means to figure out what the problem is and how to solve it.  So Petra wants to be part of the conference – the videoconfe rence, but she doesn’t want be actively participating, we could say.  She wants  to lurk in the background and if there’s a problem she will troubleshoot it; she will figure out what the problem is and what the solution should be.

Ewan says, “If Desmond put you in charge of setting  up the meeting, he’ll want you to take a more active part.”  “To take a more a ctive part” means to be an actual participant, to be talking and to be asking questions and so forth.

Petra then begins to breathe heavily; she starts br eathing so that you can hear her breathe.  Ewan says, “What are you doing?”  Pet ra says, “Hyperventilating.  I don’t think I’m ready for this.”  “To hyperventilat e” means to breathe very quickly and deeply, usually because you are very nervous or  you’re frightened about something.  Someone who starts to hyperventilate is  breathing very fast and it could be dangerous; if they’re very nervous or very  excited that might happen. So Petra isn’t really ready to facilitate, much les s to set up the conference call or videoconference.  Maybe she’s not as smart as I tho ught she was!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ewan:  Who’s running the videoconference next week?

Petra:  I am.  Desmond put me in charge of it last week.

Ewan:  Oh, somebody’s moving up in the world.  It’s  nice that he’s giving you more responsibility.

Petra:  Yeah, but I’m not sure I’m ready.

Ewan:  I’ve set up conference calls and videoconfer ences before.  Maybe you can tell me what you’ve already done and I can see if you’ve missed anything.

Petra:  That would be great.  Okay, I’ve scheduled the meeting for 3:00…

Ewan:  Stop right there.  If the videoconference is  at 3:00 here, it’s already 6:00 on the East Coast.  That’s too late to start the me eting, don’t you think?

Petra:  Oh, I didn’t factor in time zones!  But I s till have time to reschedule, I think, so it’s not a total catastrophe.

Ewan:  Good.  Be sure to initiate the call or the c onnection at least 10 minutes before the time of the meeting, and make sure you k now how to reconnect someone if they get disconnected during the meeting .

 Our story begins when I say, “After three months of  summer vacation (“vacation” is when you don’t work), I was looking forward to t he start of a new school year.” Now the story begins, and I’m in my classroom talki ng to my students.  I begin by saying, “Okay, everybody, settle down.”  “To settle  down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop talking, to stop moving around , to listen to what I am saying.  It’s something that a teacher would say to  his or her students to get them to be quiet when they want to start their class.  S o, I say, “Okay, everybody settle down.  Take your seats and get out your textbook.”  “To take your seat” means to sit down, to go where you are supposed to sit down.   It doesn’t mean to pick up your seat and walk away, it means to sit in your ch air.  “To get out (something)” means to go into your bag or into your desk and rem ove it.  In this case, you’re supposed to get out your textbook.  Your “textbook”  is a book used in school about a particular subject.  It could be history, it could be biology, it could be English, those could all have textbooks.

Then I say, “Charlie,” one of my not too bright stu dents, “Charlie, eyes on your own book.”  “Eyes (eyes) on” is a phrase we use whe n someone is looking at someone else’s book or someone else’s homework perh aps or someone else’s test when they shouldn’t be.  “Eyes on your own boo k” would mean stop looking at something else and pay attention to your book, i n this case.  You could say, “eyes on the screen,” meaning everyone let’s watch what is on the television or on the movie screen.

“Kathy,” I say, “do you have something to share wit h the rest of the class?” Kathy is talking to someone else when she’s not sup posed to.  So one thing that teachers sometimes do to get students to shut up – to be quiet is to ask them if they have something to share with the rest of the class.  “To share” means to tell other people, to say to other people.  What the tea cher is saying here is you shouldn’t be talking, and if you’re going to talk t hen you’re going to have to tell everyone about what you are talking about in your p rivate conversation.  So it’s another way of telling Kathy just to shut up, to be  quiet.  “Shut up” is a little rude; it’s not something you want to say to someone unles s you’re angry with them. Well, you shouldn’t say it when you’re angry either , but anyway.  I then say to Kathy, who’s not a very good student because she’s not paying attention, I say, “No?  Then put that away until recess.”  So perhaps  Kathy is texting or playing a video game or perhaps she’s passing a note to her f riend.  But I tell her to put that away – meaning get it away from where you are now, put it in your pocket or your purse – until recess.  “Recess” (recess) is a break that you have in school when the kids – the children usually go outside and  they play for 15 minutes or 20 minutes in between your classes.  When I was in school we had, I think, one recess break in the morning, so that for 15 or 20 m inutes all the students would

go outside if it wasn’t too cold, and walk around a nd play a game or smoke a cigarette – you know, what…what elementary school c hildren do!

Well, back to my class here.  I now say, “does anyo ne know the answer to this question I’ve written on the board?”  “The board” ( board) is the chalkboard, at least it was when I was in school.  It’s a board th at you can write things on with a piece of chalk.  Usually the chalk is white and the  board is black, that’s why we call it a “blackboard.”  Now, we have what are call ed “whiteboards,” which are white pieces of plastic that you use colored marker s on to write, but when I was going to school it was just the chalkboard.  So in the story here, I’m asking if the students know the answer to the question I wrote on  the board.  Then I say, “Don’t everybody speak at once.”  This is a joke th at a teacher might make when no one raises their hand.  No one says they know the answer, or indicates they know their answer by putting their hand up in the a ir.  We call that “raising your hand.”  I say, “Don’t everybody speak at once.”  “A t once” means at the same time.  Of course no one is speaking, so I’m joking here; I’m reminding them that they don’t know the answer because they’re not very  bright, my students.  I say, “Raise your hand if you have an answer.”  Then I say to another student, “Patrick, wait your turn.”  “To wait your turn” mea ns that you have to wait for someone else who is before you.  You’re going to do  things in order; in this case, in the order that people raised their hand.  So fir st Therese raised her hand, so she gets to answer first.  Then Patrick, who raised  his hand second, can speak. So I tell Patrick to wait his turn.  But remember n one of my students are very intelligent, so Therese will probably get the wrong  answer and so will Patrick!

Then I say to two more students, “Michael and Steph en, no talking in the back of the classroom.”  Michael and Stephen are talking wh en they should not be, because they’re bad students, and I tell them they should stop talking.  “No talking in the back of the classroom.”  They’re sit ting very far from the teacher, way in the back of the room.  Then I say, “Tim, sit  still and eyes forward.”  Tim, another student, is probably moving around in his c hair.  I tell him to sit still, meaning don’t move.  “Eyes forward” means you shoul d be looking straight ahead at me, the teacher, or at the blackboard, not  around at all the other students.  I tell him to pay attention.  “Pay atten tion” means listen to what I am saying; watch me, not someone else.  Then I say to Mark, “Mark, are you paying attention?  I just called on you.”  “To call on (so meone)” in a classroom means to say someone’s name so they can give an answer to a question; they’re expected to talk.  When I call on you, I’m going to ask you the capitals of the United States and you have to tell me what they are, all 50 of th em.  That’s to call on someone.

Then I say, “Duane and Frank, I don’t see you two j otting down the assignment for tomorrow.”  “To jot (jot) down” means to write down, usually write down

something on a piece of paper quickly.  I tell Duan e and Frank, two more of my bad students, that they’re not jotting down the ass ignment for tomorrow.  An “assignment” in this case is homework, but it could  be anything that your boss or your teacher tells you have to do.  In this case, it’s “homework,” things you’re supposed to do for tomorrow’s class.

Then I say, “Okay, everybody, read silently at your  desks for the next 10 minutes.”  “To read silently” means to read somethi ng and not talk – not talk to anyone else.

I end my story by saying, “I always forget how exha usting it is to manage a classroom full of students.”  “To be exhausting” me ans to be very tiring, something that makes you tired because it’s so diff icult, it takes so much energy. And, managing a classroom, especially a classroom of not very intelligent or well- behaved students, students who are always talking o r doing things they should not be doing like the students in my story, can be very exhausting.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of story]

After three months of summer vacation, I was lookin g forward to the start of a new school year. …

Okay, everybody, settle down.  Take your seats and get out your textbook.

Charlie, eyes on your own book.  And Kathy, do you have something to share with the rest of the class?  No?  Then put that awa y until recess.

Now, does anyone know the answer to this question I ’ve written on the board? Don’t everybody speak at once.  Raise your hand if you have an answer. Patrick, wait your turn.  Therese raised her hand f irst.

Michael and Stephen, no talking in the back of the classroom.  Tim, sit still and eyes forward.  Pay attention.  Mark, are you paying  attention?  I just called on you.

Duane and Frank, I don’t see you two jotting down t he assignment for tomorrow.

Okay, everybody, read silently at your desks for the next 10 minutes. …

 I always forget how exhausting it is to manage a cl assroom full of students.  How many months is it before our next summer vacation?

Our scriptwriter is always paying attention.  That’ s because we have the excellent student, Dr. Lucy Tse.  Thank you, Lucy.

The names in today’s story were completely fictiona l – made up, they don’t represent anyone real.  Did I mention that my broth ers’ and sisters’ names were Tim, Pat, Mark, Mike, Therese, Duane, Frank, Charli e, Kathy, and Stephen? No?





# Being Cautious or Thrill-Seeking

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 798:  Being Cautious or Thrill-Seeking.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 798.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there today to downl oad a Learning Guide for this episode.  You can do that by becoming a member  of ESL Podcast.

This episode is a dialogue between Paula and Robert  about different kinds of personalities: people who like to be careful or cau tious, and people who don’t. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paula:  Did you get an invitation to Kip and Sheri’ s wedding?

Robert:  Yeah, I did.  I’m still trying to wrap my head around the two of them getting married.  Never in my wildest dreams would I put those two together.  It boggles my mind that they’re in the least compatibl e.

Paula:  What do you mean?

Robert:  Sheri is really adventurous and definitely  a thrill-seeker.

Paula:  Maybe she’s mellowed over the years.

Robert:  I don’t think so, and Kip is the opposite.   He’s always toed the line and I don’t think he has an adventurous bone in his body.

Paula:  I’ve never thought of Kip as being uptight.

Robert:  No, he’s not uptight.  He’s just very caut ious.  You’d never find him looking for an adrenaline rush or even a little nov elty.

Paula:  You know what they say: opposites attract.

Robert:  If that’s true, then in their case, polar opposites attract!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Paula saying to Robert, “D id you get an invitation to Kip and Sheri’s wedding?”  Robert says, “Yeah (yes), I did.  I’m still trying to wrap my head around the two of them getting married.”  “To wrap (wrap) your head around (something)” means to be able to understand or try to understand something that’s very difficult, that is perhaps su rprising or even strange in some way.  Robert says, “Never in my wildest dreams woul d I put those two together.” The expression “never in my wildest dreams” means t hat this event – this situation is very unlikely; you never thought it wo uld happen.  “Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would quit my job  as a professor and become a professional podcaster.”  That’s true!  “Never in m y wildest dreams,” I never thought that would be possible.  Robert says, “It b oggles my mind that they’re in the least compatible.”  “To boggle (boggle) your mi nd” means you find something very confusing, very surprising, very difficult to understand.  It’s similar to trying to wrap your head around something.  If you have diffi culty wrapping your head around something, it boggles your mind; it’s so unu sual, it’s so strange, it’s difficult for you to understand.

Robert says it boggles his mind that they (Kip and Sheri) are in the least compatible.  “To be compatible” means to be able to  work together.  Usually we use this adjective when we are describing two peopl e who are romantically linked or romantically connected; we say these two people are compatible, that means their personalities can work with each other, they can get along, they would be a good couple, a good marriage, a good relationship.  “In the least” means even a little bit, even a small amount.  So, when Robert s ays, “It boggles my mind that they are in the least compatible,” he means he’s su rprised they’re compatible at all, even in a little amount, even in a small amoun t.  There’s a common expression – another common expression “I’m not int erested in the least” or “I’m not in the least interested,” that means I’m not in terested at all.  “Do you want to go with me to the party?” and she says, “No, I’m no t interested in going with you in the least,” not at all.  Move on, find somebody else, that’s what she’s saying. Well, that’s what Robert is saying.  He’s surprised  that Kip and Sheri are a couple, are getting married in fact.

Paula is confused; she says, “What do you mean?”  R obert says, “Sheri is really adventurous and definitely a thrill-seeker.”  “To b e adventurous” means to want to have exciting new experiences, to want to do thi ngs that perhaps are a little dangerous, like driving in Los Angeles for example.   Robert describes Sheri as a thrill-seeker.  “To seek” (seek) means to look for something.  “To be a seeker,” with an “er” at the end, would be a person who is s eeking something – who is looking for something.  Well, Sheri is seeking thri lls (thrills).  A “thrill-seeker” is

someone who’s looking for thrills.  “Thrills” is an other word for excitement, things that are exciting to do.  Usually we use this word for people who are perhaps looking for things that are even a little dangerous , a little risky.

Paula says, “Maybe Sheri’s mellowed over the years. ”  Maybe she has mellowed (mellowed).  “To mellow” means to become calmer, pe rhaps less exciting, but also someone who doesn’t get upset as easily or som eone who doesn’t need to have all of the excitement and adventure in their l ife.  I definitely have mellowed over the years.  I used to drink regular Coke – reg ular Coca-Cola, now I drink Diet Coca-Cola.  Less exciting, more mellow, but th at’s me!  That’s what happens when you get older, kids.

Robert says, “I don’t think so.”  He doesn’t think Sheri has mellowed over the years – in recent years.  He says, “Kip is the oppo site.”  The “opposite” is something that is very different, something that wo uld be the complete reversal of another situation: open and closed, on and off; the se are all opposites.  Robert says that Kip has always toed the line and I don’t think he has an adventurous bone in his body.  “To toe (toe) the line” means to  follow the rules exactly, to do what you are told to do, what you are expected to d o.  Robert says, “I don’t think Kip has an adventurous bone in his body.  This is a  common expression: “He doesn’t have a blank  bone in his body.”  “He doesn’t have a romantic bo ne in his body.”  “He doesn’t have an adventurous bone in his  body.”  “He doesn’t have a thrill-seeking bone in his body.”  You could put in  any adjective there.  What you’re saying is that this person is not like that at all, has absolutely none of those qualities, none of those characteristics.  So  Robert is saying that Kip is not adventurous at all, “not in the least” we might say .

Paula says, “I’ve never thought of Kip as being upt ight.”  “Uptight” (uptight – one word) is a good word to know, it means to be tense,  but also to be wanting to control everything.  It’s definitely a negative way  of describing someone.  If you say, “Oh, he’s really uptight,” usually that means he’s too conservative, he’s too restricted in what he will allow himself to do.  It ’s almost always used as a criticism of someone.  Notice that Paula thinks tha t because he isn’t adventurous he must be uptight.  That’s not necessarily true, b ut that’s what Paula thinks.

Robert says, “No, he’s not uptight.  He’s just very  cautious.”  He’s just very careful, he doesn’t take a lot of risks.  Robert sa ys, “You’d never find him looking for an adrenaline rush or even a little novelty.”  “Adrenaline” (adrenaline) is a hormone, a special chemical in your body that gets released when something dangerous or exciting happens; it can cause you to perhaps start having your heart beat faster.  Adrenaline is something that ha ppens when people perhaps are faced with a dangerous situation or an exciting  situation.  A “rush” (rush) is

any sort of exciting feeling, any sort of emotion t hat you would feel when you are excited, usually a positive thing.  So, an “adrenal ine rush” would be a positive feeling you would have when something very exciting  happens.  “Novelty” (novelty) here means simply something that is new, something that is interesting. The word “novel” means new.  “Novel” can also be a book – a fiction book that you read, a long story.  But here, it means somethi ng that’s new.

Paula says, “You know what they say: opposites attr act.”  “To attract” means that something pulls something else toward it, like two parts of a magnet.  Well, the expression “opposites attract” means that two peopl e who may be very different in terms of their personality might be attracted to  each other, they may be romantically or become romantically interested in e ach other.  It’s an old expression, the idea that sometimes people who are very different from each other are attracted to each other.  I don’t know if  this is true.  I suppose you could find something different in almost every couple – e very husband and wife or every romantic relationship – and say, “Oh, look.  See, they’re opposite.”  But, there are things that you’re always going to have d ifferent from your romantic partner, so I’m not sure that’s necessarily true.  But, that’s expression: “opposites attract.”  It was also a terrible song by Paula Abd ul back in the 1980s, but that’s another – another, uh, episode!

Robert says, “If that’s true (if it’s true that opp osites attract), then in their case, polar opposites attract!”  There’s another expressi on, for something to be a “polar (polar) opposite,” that means that two things are a s different from each other as they possibly can be.  They’re not just opposite, t hey’re extreme opposites, they’re “polar opposites.”  You can think of the No rth Pole and the South Pole in opposite ends of the Earth, or two poles of a magne t.  Well, “polar opposites” are extreme opposites, things that are very different.  Robert is making a little joke. He’s saying not only are Kip and Sheri opposites, t hey’re polar opposites.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paula:  Did you get an invitation to Kip and Sheri’ s wedding?

Robert:  Yeah, I did.  I’m still trying to wrap my head around the two of them getting married.  Never in my wildest dreams would I put those two together.  It boggles my mind that they’re in the least compatibl e.

Paula:  What do you mean?

Robert:  Sheri is really adventurous and definitely  a thrill-seeker.

Paula:  Maybe she’s mellowed over the years.

Robert:  I don’t think so, and Kip is the opposite.   He’s always toed the line and I don’t think he has an adventurous bone in his body.

Paula:  I’ve never thought of Kip as being uptight.

Robert:  No, he’s not uptight.  He’s just very caut ious.  You’d never find him looking for an adrenaline rush or even a little nov elty.

Paula:  You know what they say: opposites attract.

Robert:  If that’s true, then in their case, polar opposites attract!

Sometimes it boggles my mind just how wonderful our  scripts are here on ESL Podcast; that’s because they’re written by the amaz ing Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Dealing With the Heat

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 799: Dealing With the Heat.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 799.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in – you guessed it – Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there, become a memb er of ESL Podcast; help support this podcast.  Keep us going!

This episode is about dealing with or handling the heat, when it gets very hot outside.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jolene:  I’m sweating like a pig.  When is this hea t wave going to end?

Eric:  I’ve no idea, but I’m not moving a muscle un til it does.  Hand me that pitcher of iced tea, would you?

Jolene:  Get it yourself.  I’m not moving until it drops below 80 degrees.

Eric:  It’s not the temperature.  It’s the humidity .  It’s not even the dog days of summer yet and it’s scorching outside.

Jolene:  It’s scorching inside, too.  Why can’t tha t fan move any faster?  Remind me why we moved into an apartment with no air condi tioner?

Eric:  We couldn’t afford an apartment with an air conditioner.  We were lucky to get this place.

Jolene:  I don’t feel so lucky right now.  My legs are stuck to this chair and I’ve sweated through my clothes.

Eric:  We could buy a portable air conditioner.

Jolene:  We can?

Eric:  Yeah, but you’d have to get up.

Jolene:  Ugh, let’s do it tomorrow.

[end of dialogue]

This episode is entitled – has the title of – “Deal ing With the Heat.”  “To deal (deal) with (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to manage or to handle, to react to something in a certain way.  This is deali ng with the heat, when the temperature gets very high.

Jolene – who is not high, but is apparently hot – s ays, “I’m sweating like a pig.” “To sweat” (sweat) means you have liquid leaving yo ur body, because your body is so hot so there is what feels like water on your  skin.  Many people sweat a lot when it gets hot.  I have a friend who sweats a lot , even like when it’s 75 degrees; I mean it’s kind of strange.  But anyway, “to sweat” means to have this water on your body – this liquid that comes out of your body when it gets very hot.  “Sweat” also has other meanings in English; t ake a look at our Learning Guide for those.  Jolene says, “When is this heat w ave going to end?”  A “heat wave” (wave – two words) is a period of time, usual ly a couple of days, maybe a week, when the temperature seems very hot, when it’ s hotter than usual.  In the summertime we often have heat waves here in Los Ang eles, where it gets very hot for maybe a week or so.  Doesn’t happen all tha t often, but it does happen.

Eric says, “I’ve no idea (I have no idea when this heat wave is going to end he means), but I’m not moving a muscle until it does.”   “To not move a muscle” means not to move, not to get up, not to move your body, because it’s so hot – that’s the idea.  Eric says, “Hand me (or give me) that pitcher of iced tea, would you?”  A “pitcher” is a large glass or plastic cont ainer that we use to put liquid in. “Pitcher” (pitcher) is something we would use for b eer or tea or some other sort of usually cold liquid.

Eric says he wants some iced tea, some tea that has  ice in it.  Jolene, however, is not interested in helping Eric; she says, “Get it yourself.  I’m not moving until it (the temperature) drops below 80 degrees.”  “To dro p” means to go lower. “Drop” has a couple of other meanings in English as  well; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.  Here it means for the te mperature to go down; in this case, to go below 80 degrees.  A “degree” here mean s a unit of measurement of temperature.  In the United States, we use the Fahr enheit scale; in most other countries the Celsius scale is used.

Eric says, “It’s not the temperature.  It’s the hum idity.”  He’s saying the reason it’s so uncomfortable outside or uncomfortable where the y are is because of the humidity, not because of the temperature.  “Humidit y” is how much moisture –

how much liquid is in the air – how much water is i n the air.  “Temperature” refers to how hot or cold it is.  So, you could have a ver y high temperature but not very much humidity.  It could be very dry out; there’s n ot very much water in the air. Places like Phoenix, Arizona, or anywhere in a dese rt, has very high temperatures but also very dry weather, so it’s wha t we would call a “dry heat,” there’s not a lot humidity.  Some places have both heat and humidity, states like Florida for example, in the southeast part of the U nited States, and there when it gets hot it gets very uncomfortable because there’s  also a lot of water in the air. This is actually sort of an old expression: “It’s n ot the heat, it’s the humidity.”  Eric says, “It’s not the temperature.  It’s the humidity ,” but there’s a more common way of saying that.  “It’s not the heat, it’s the h umidity,” meaning the real problem is not that it’s hot out, but that there’s so much water in the air.

Eric says, “It’s not even the dog days of summer ye t and it’s scorching outside.” “The dog days of summer” is an expression used to d escribe the hottest days of the year in the summertime.  Usually in the United States, that’s sometime in July or August.  The phrase is sort of associated with t he time where it’s so hot that you can’t really do anything else, so it might not be a very exciting time of year because it’s so hot.  The dog days of summer would be days where it’s so hot you can’t really have a lot of fun.

Eric says, “it’s scorching outside.”  When we say s omething is “scorching” (scorching) we mean it’s extremely hot.  Jolene say s, “It’s scorching inside, too (meaning inside of the house).  Why can’t that fan move any faster?”  A “fan” (fan) here means a small machine that moves air aro und; it blows air in a little circle that is supposed to help make you cooler.  J olene says, “Remind me why we moved into an apartment with no air conditioner? ”  An “air conditioner” is a machine that produces cold air during times when it ’s hot outside.  Jolene says, “Remind me.”  Literally, this means help me remembe r something, but in the way that she’s using it she’s really sort of complainin g.  She’s wondering why we did something that perhaps wasn’t very intelligent, was n’t a very good idea.  “Remind me why we moved into an apartment with no air condi tioning.  The “remind me” means I think we made a mistake; she’s saying that we made a mistake.

Eric answers her; he says, “We couldn’t afford an a partment with an air conditioner.”  “To afford” means to have enough mon ey.  Eric says that he and Jolene could not afford an apartment with an air co nditioner.  “We were lucky to get this place,” he says.  Jolene says, “I don’t fe el so lucky right now.  My legs are stuck to this chair and I’ve sweated through my  clothes.”  “To be stuck” (stuck) means to be attached to something else, oft en so that you can’t move it or not move it very easily.  Because Jolene is swea ting so much she’s stuck to her chair; she can’t move because the water is stic king to her skin and to the

chair.  Jolene says that she’s sweated through her clothes.  “To sweat through” means that you’ve been sweating so much your clothe s are now wet.  Your shirt and your pants are wet because of your sweat.  “Wet  from sweat,” we might say.

Eric says, “We could buy a portable air conditioner .”  Something that is “portable” (portable) is something you can move easily from on e place to another.  Eric says that they could buy a portable air conditioner .  Air conditioners usually are either in a window or they’re part of the building or the house where you live; they’re part of the way that the house or apartment  is built, you don’t have to buy a separate machine.  But it is possible to buy a se parate portable air conditioner you can just move from one room to another.

Jolene says, “We can?”  Eric says, “Yeah, but we’d have to get up,” meaning we’d have to leave our seats and actually go somewh ere.  Jolene says, “Ugh, let’s do it tomorrow.”  She’s so tired, she’s so ho t, she doesn’t want to get up and get the portable air conditioner today.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jolene:  I’m sweating like a pig.  When is this hea t wave going to end?

Eric:  I’ve no idea, but I’m not moving a muscle un til it does.  Hand me that pitcher of iced tea, would you?

Jolene:  Get it yourself.  I’m not moving until it drops below 80 degrees.

Eric:  It’s not the temperature.  It’s the humidity .  It’s not even the dog days of summer yet and it’s scorching outside.

Jolene:  It’s scorching inside, too.  Why can’t tha t fan move any faster?  Remind me why we moved into an apartment with no air condi tioner?

# Advertising Jobs on the Internet

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 800: Advertising Jobs on the Internet.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 800.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Eight hundred, I feel so old!

This 800 th  ESL Podcast has, like all of our current episodes,  a Learning Guide, where you can get the transcript for the episode as  well as vocabulary definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, culture n otes, and comprehension questions.  Go to our website at eslpod.com to beco me a member and to download the Learning Guide.

This episode is a dialogue between Wendy and Pedro about advertising a job on the Internet.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Wendy:  I’ve just heard that you’re not going to us e a recruitment agency to fill the new position.

Pedro:  No, I’m not.  There are so many Internet jo b boards out there that I think we can find good candidates without using headhunte rs.

Wendy:  But headhunters do a good job of weeding ou t people who don’t have the right experience or qualifications.

Pedro:  Yes, but they also charge a large commissio n.  I’m going to post an ad on a few major job boards to see what happens.  Mos t of them don’t charge a listing fee so there’s no harm in trying.

Wendy:  I predict you’re going to be flooded with a pplications, and it’s going to take a lot of time to separate the good from the bad.

[end of dialogue]

Wendy begins our dialogue by saying to Pedro, “I ju st heard that you’re not going to use a recruitment agency to fill the new positio n.”  “To recruit” means to find someone to do a job or to become a member of an org anization.  So, a “recruitment agency” is a company that goes out and  finds people for you to hire, people who would be qualified to work in a position  that you need to fill.  When we use the verb “to fill” (fill) when talking about  jobs we mean to hire someone for a particular job, to find someone to work for your company.  So, we might talk about “filling a position” – the “position” is the job.  “To fill it” is to find someone who you will hire – who you will employ – to work a t that job.

Pedro says, “No, I’m not.”  I’m not going to use a recruitment agency to fill the new position.  He says, “There are so many Internet  job boards out there that I think we can find good candidates without using hea dhunters.”  A “job board” is a collection of different jobs and their descriptions .  It’s actually more technically a place where you advertise jobs.  In the old days, b efore the Internet, sometimes companies – and I know the government often did thi s – they would put new job announcements on a physical board in some building,  and you could go down and look at the board and look at the new, we would  call them, “job postings,” because “to post” means to place a piece of paper o r an announcement in a place that other people can see it, as on a big boa rd or wall.  You could go and look at these job postings on a job board, which wa s a physical place in a building that you could go and visit.  Well nowadays, we talk about job boards on the Internet, we mean websites where you can go and  look for new jobs, because they have descriptions of new jobs placed o r posted there.

Pedro says that there are so many Internet job boar ds “out there,” meaning in existence, “that I think we can find good candidate s without using headhunters.” A “candidate” (candidate) is a person who you are t hinking about hiring for a job, or a person who wants to be considered for the job that you are hiring for.  A “headhunter” is a person whose job it is to find a good person for the job you’re looking for.  A lot of times big companies don’t wa nt to go through the time of trying to find a good candidate to fill a position,  so they’ll hire a recruitment

agency, and the people in the agency will go out an d “hunt,” or look for “heads,” people who could work for that company.  Many times  these are people who are already working at other companies.  The headhunter  will approach them – will call them and say, “Hey, would you like to work for  this company over here?” That’s what a headhunter does; he or she is a recru iter, a person who goes out and finds people for jobs.

Wendy says, “But headhunters do a good job of weedi ng out people who don’t have the right experience or qualifications.”  “To weed (weed) out (someone)” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to eliminate or get  rid of the least desirable members of a large group of items, to only keep the  best ones.  “We’re going to weed out all of the bad or not qualified candidates .”  Sometimes we call them “applicants.”  People who apply for a job are peopl e who want to be hired for a job, and so from the verb “to apply” we get the noun “applicant.”  So we’re going to weed out the bad or unqualified applicants, or u nqualified candidates.  “To weed out” means to get rid of the bad ones, and kee p the good ones to look at those more closely.  “Weed” has a lot of different meanings in English – and I mean a lot of different meanings!  Take a look at o ur Learning Guide for some of those.

So, Wendy is concerned because she thinks the headh unters would do a better job of weeding people out who don’t have the right qualifications – the right abilities or skills.  Pedro says, “Yes, but headhun ters also charge a large commission.”  “They charge” means they make you pay , you have to pay them a certain amount of money.  We call the amount of money that they get sometimes a “commission.”  A “commission” is a fee or a price  that you pay someone to do some sort of service.  It’s often a percentage of s ome other value.  For example, if the person’s first year salary is, I don’t know,  50,000 dollars the headhunter may get a one percent fee or a three percent fee, m eaning that you have to pay them one percent of their first year salary.  I don ’t know exactly what the percentages are, but that would be an example of a commission.  If you sell a car at a car dealership – a place that sells new and us ed cars – the salesperson – you – would get a commission.  You would get a perc entage, so if you sell a more expensive car you get more money because you’r e being what we would say “paid on commission,” meaning you get a percent age of the amount that you sell.  So 10 percent, obviously, would be more mone y if you sold a 100,000-dollar car than if you sold a 50,000-dollar car.  I’ve nev er owned a 50,000-dollar car, certainly not a 100,000-dollar car, more like a 15, 000-dollar car, that’s – that’s my kind of car!

Anyway, Pedro says that he’s going to post an ad on  a few major, or important, job boards to see what happens.  “To post,” I menti oned earlier, means to place

something somewhere.  An “ad” is short for an adver tisement.  It’s an announcement that asks you to buy something or, in this case, to apply for a job. Pedro says that most of the job boards don’t charge  a listing fee so there’s no harm in trying.  A “fee” is a price that you pay for something.  A “listing fee” is the amount of money you have to pay to post your announ cement or your message in a certain place; in this case, on the website.  The expression “there’s no harm in trying” is used to show that you may not be doing something that is going to be successful, but it doesn’t matter because there’s no reason not to do it; there’s no price or no cost associated with it.  If something good happens, good; if something doesn’t it’s no big deal, it doesn’t matt er because it didn’t cost you anything or there’s no bad thing that will happen i f you do this thing.  That’s what “harm” is; “harm” is a negative consequence of some thing, something bad that happens.  Pedro says, “there’s no harm in trying,” meaning, again, it’s okay, even if it doesn’t work we haven’t lost anything.

Wendy says, “I predict” – I believe this will happe n in the future – “I predict you’re going to be flooded with applications.”  “To be flo oded (flooded) with (something)” means to receive a lot of something, more than you can handle, more than you can take care of.  “Applications” are forms or docu ments or emails from people who want the job you are advertising, who are expre ssing interest in the job, who are applicants, who are potential candidates for the job.  Wendy says, “it’s going to take a lot of time to separate the good from the  bad,” meaning the good applications or good candidates from the bad applic ations.

Pedro says, “That’s where you come in.”  This expre ssion, “that’s where you come in,” or “that’s where I come in” or “that’s wh ere he comes in,” is used to identify what another person’s job will be in a cer tain project that you’re describing.  So for example, I have a lot of essays  to grade.  I’m a teacher; I’m a professor; I have a lot of papers I have to look at .  And so I say to my teaching assistant, the person who is helping me teach the class, I say, “Well, I have all these papers to grade, and that’s where you come in ,” meaning you’re going to do the work.  Pedro is telling Wendy that she’s going to go through these applications and weed out the bad ones.

Wendy says, “What do you mean?”  Pedro says, “You a re my assistant, aren’t you?”  Wendy says, “Yes.”  “And your job is to assi st me, right?” Pedro says. Wendy says, “Yes.”  Pedro says, “Good.  Roll up you r sleeves and get ready for a busy week!”  “To roll (roll) up your sleeves (sle eves)” means to prepare to work very hard.  Your “sleeves” are the parts of your shirt or jacket that cover your arms.  So if you’re going to roll them up, you’re g oing to pull them back so that it’s up, maybe halfway up your arm.  The idea is th at when you’re going to work really hard on something you may need to roll up yo ur sleeves, you may need to

put your sleeves back so that your hands are free, your arms are free to work very hard.  The expression in general means to prep are to work very hard, and that’s what Wendy is going to have to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Wendy:  I just heard that you’re not going to use a  recruitment agency to fill the new position.

Pedro:  No, I’m not.  There are so many Internet jo b boards out there that I think we can find good candidates without using headhunte rs.

Wendy:  But headhunters do a good job of weeding ou t people who don’t have the right experience or qualifications.

Pedro:  Yes, but they also charge a large commissio n.  I’m going to post an ad on a few major job boards to see what happens.  Mos t of them don’t charge a listing fee so there’s no harm in trying.

Wendy:  I predict you’re going to be flooded with a pplications, and it’s going to take a lot of time to separate the good from the bad.

Pedro:  That’s where you come in.

Wendy:  What do you mean?

Pedro:  You are my assistant, aren’t you?

Wendy:  Yes.

Pedro:  And your job is to assist me, right?

Wendy:  Yes.

Pedro:  Good.  Roll up your sleeves and get ready f or a busy week!
