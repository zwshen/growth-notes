Problem</a>

</h1>

<p>
The famous mathematician Hardy relates the following episode with the
(now also famous) Indian mathematician Ramanujan:

<p>
<em> I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had
 ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to
 me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable
 omen. "No," he replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the
 smallest number expressible as the sum of two positive cubes in two different
 ways." </em>

<p>
Your objective is to print <em>cab numbers</em>
in a given range, [<img
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="962img1.png"
 ALT="$n1$">; <img
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="962img1.png"
 ALT="$n1$">+<img
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="962img2.png"
 ALT="$rg$">], 
specified by its lower limit, <img
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="962img1.png"
 ALT="$n1$">, and the size of
the interval, <img
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="962img2.png"
 ALT="$rg$">. A number is a <em>cab number</em> if it can be
expressed as the sum of two positive cubes, in at least two different
ways. 


<p>

<h1><a NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">

Input</a>
</h1>
Input contains several test cases. For each test case, you are given two numbers in two rows, 
the lower limit <img
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="962img1.png"
 ALT="$n1$"> and the range we
are interested in, <img
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="962img2.png"
 ALT="$rg$">. The lower limit is between 1 and 1000000000 (1E+9).
The range is between 1 and 100000. EOF indicates the end of the input.

<p>

<h1><a NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Output</a>
</h1>

For each test case, you should output a list of <em>cab numbers</em>, 
in the specified range. The numbers
should be separated by newlines. If there is
no cab number in the range, 
you should output one single line with the word <em>None</em>.
