On this episode, we learn all about how to keep – t hat is, how to store – food. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lee: Wow, what are we going to do with all these le ftovers?

Sarah: Let’s store them in different containers and  we can each take some to work to share. We won’t be able to eat all of this ourselves, and I don’t want it to go to waste.

Lee: Okay, I’ll get some plastic containers and san dwich bags for the cookies.

Sarah: Can you also grab some wax paper, too? We’ll  need to put some between each brownie so they don’t stick together.

Lee: We’re not going to have enough plastic contain ers. How about wrapping up some of this food in Saran wrap or aluminum foil?

Sarah: Great idea. I think I have some freezer bags , too. We might as well freeze a couple of pieces of cake to eat later.

Lee: I wish we could vacuum seal them and store mor e pieces. That cake was really good!

Sarah: I know. I could eat three pieces in one sitt ing.

Lee: Hmm. On second thought, for the sake of our wa istlines, maybe that wouldn’t be such a good idea.

Our dialogue today is all about storing, or keeping , food. It begins with Lee saying to Sarah, “Wow, what are we going to do with  all these leftovers?” “Leftovers” (leftovers) refers to food that was ser ved at a meal, such as at dinner, but that nobody ate. Usually leftovers, if there is  a lot of food, are kept to be eaten later. Of course, you don’t want to throw awa y good food. So, leftovers would be food that was prepared for one meal, wasn’ t eaten, and is then stored to be eaten at a later time. “To store,” as a verb,  means to keep something to use in the future, to put away something to use later.

Sarah says, “Let’s store them,” meaning the leftove rs, “in different containers.” A “container” (container) is a box that is used to st ore something. You could have a plastic container, which is very common in kitchens  in the United States. Plastic containers are often used to store leftovers. Sarah  says, “We can take some to work to share.” She’s referring here to the leftove rs. They can take some of the leftovers to work in order to give to other people to eat. She says, “We won’t be able to eat all of this ourselves, and I don’t want  it to go to waste.”

“To go to waste” (waste) means that it will not be used and will therefore have to be thrown away. The word “waste” is often used to r efer to junk or garbage or simply something that you’re not going to use anymo re and that you are going to get rid of or throw way. “To let something go to wa ste” means to not eat something, in this case, or use something, and ther efore it will have to be thrown away because, of course, food won’t last forever. E ventually the food will change in such a way that you can no longer eat it.

Lee says, “Okay, I’ll get some plastic containers a nd sandwich bags for the cookies.” “Plastic” (plastic) is a material that we  use to make all sorts of things, including containers (I mentioned earlier about how  popular plastic containers are in American kitchens). Well, plastic is the materia l that is used for all sorts of things nowadays. It can be a soft material or it ca n be a very hard material. “Sandwich bags” are small plastic bags that are use d to put, well, sandwiches in, or small amounts of food.

You don’t have to put a sandwich in a sandwich bag.  You can put any sort of food inside of one. A sandwich bag is usually about  a half a quart, let’s say, in size. It’s not that big. Maybe three or four inches  by four or five inches, something like that. Sarah says, “Can you also grab some wax paper, too?” “Wax (wax) paper” is paper that has a little bit of wax on it that’s used for wrapping up food or for using especially with “baking” – when you cook food inside of an oven.

“Wax” is a substance that we normally associate wit h candles; most candles are made out of wax. But “wax paper” is a special kind of paper that is used either in cooking or in storing food. Sarah says, “We need to  put some” – meaning some wax paper – “between each brownie so they don’t sti ck together.” One common use of wax paper is to use it to separate different  pieces of food that you want to separate later on.

A “brownie” is a small chocolate sweet that is quit e popular with my wife, for example, made from typically sugar, butter, flour, and chocolate. Usually we use a little bit of egg when making a brownie as well. Lee says, “We’re not going to have enough plastic containers,” meaning we have mo re food than we have containers to store it in. “How about wrapping up s ome of this food in Saran wrap or aluminum foil?”

“To wrap (wrap) up” is a two-word phrasal verb mean ing to package something, to put something in a container in order to either use it later or to move it from one place to another. If you give someone a gift, y ou usually wrap it with what is called “wrapping paper” (such as a birthday gift or  a gift for, say, Christmas). “To wrap up,” as a phrasal verb, means to put something  around the object – in this case, the food – in order to transport it or to sto re it.

Lee talks about two different kinds of materials th at could be used to wrap up food. The first is “Saran (Saran) wrap.” Saran wrap  is a thin, clear piece of plastic that is used for wrapping up food. The important th ing about Saran wrap is that it sticks very easily to plastic and to itself. So you  can put Saran wrap around something and it will stay wrapped – it won’t come apart like, for example, a piece of regular paper.

“Aluminum foil” (foil) is a thin piece of a flexibl e metal called “aluminum” – at least, it’s made with aluminum in it. Typically it’ s silver in color and is used, again, to wrap food up. Almost every American kitchen will  have both Saran wrap and aluminum foil for storing things, for wrapping thin gs up.

Sarah says, “Great idea. I think I have some freeze r bags, too.” A “freezer” (freezer) is a place where you keep things frozen, of course. That would be below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. A “freezer bag” is a s pecial kind of plastic bag that usually is a little thicker than a sandwich bag and  a little bigger in size, but you can use to put food into and then store in the free zer.

Sarah says, “We might as well freeze a couple of pi eces of cake to eat later.” The expression “might as well” is used to make a sugges tion or to agree with another person’s suggestion, but not with a lot of exciteme nt or enthusiasm. You’re

saying, “Well, yes. We should do this,” but you’re not that excited about it. If you don’t do it, it won’t be a big deal. Sarah tells Le e that they “might as well freeze a couple pieces of cake to eat later.”

Lee says, “I wish we could vacuum seal them and sto re more pieces. That cake was really good.” “To vacuum (vacuum) seal” somethi ng is to put it in a special kind of plastic package, usually, and remove all or  most of the air from the package. This is often done with food in order to e nsure – to make sure – that it doesn’t spoil, that it keeps fresh, that you can us e it later on. Some people own special machine that will create vacuum seals aroun d food so that you can have a better system of storing it. I don’t have one, my self.

Sarah says, “I know,” agreeing with Lee’s assessmen t of the cake as being really good. “I could eat three pieces in one sitting.” Sa rah says the cake is so good that she could eat three parts of the cake, three p ieces of the cake, “in one sitting.” “In one sitting” (sitting) means at once,  or at one time without taking a break. Sarah is saying she could sit down and have one piece of cake and then another piece of cake and then another piece of cak e, all at one time.

Lee says, “Hmm,” indicating that he’s thinking abou t something. “On second thought” – thinking about it more carefully – “for the sake of our waistlines, maybe that wouldn’t be such a good idea.” Lee is sa ying that maybe the suggestion of freezing more cake is not a good idea . Why? Because he’s worried about his and Sarah’s waistlines. Your “waist” (wai st) – notice the different spelling from an identically sounding word “waste,”  as in “to go to waste” – refers to a part of your body that is above your hips and below your ribs.

So basically, when you put on a pair of pants, the pants go up to your “waistline.” That’s the line that would indicate where your wais t is located. Usually when you are measuring your waistline, you are measuring a p art of your body that is just above your hips. Your “hips” are at the tops of you r legs – where your top of your body, what we would call your “torso” (torso), is j oined to your legs. That’s the waist area, and the waistline would be, in this cas e, an indication of how fat you are or how skinny you are.

If you’re worried about your waistline, you’re worr ied about getting too fat and gaining too much weight, and that’s what Lee is ref erring to. He’s saying that perhaps we shouldn’t keep this cake because if we e at it, we’ll become fat. And that, in fact, happens quite a bit when people eat too much cake, bread, pasta, sugar – all the good things in life.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
