This episode is a dialogue between Angelica and Cor ey about what is always bad news, a plane crash – when a plane falls down o ut of the sky. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Angelica: So the book I’m writing starts with a pla ne crash.

Corey: What caused it?

Angelica: It doesn’t matter. That’s not part of the  story.

Corey: But characters have backstories, so you shou ld have a backstory for the plane crash.

Angelica: Okay, the plane crashed because of mechan ical failure, or better yet, pilot error.

Corey: What happened? Was it because the pilot misr ead the instruments or had a problem navigating?

Angelica: I don’t know.

Corey: Maybe he or she was incapacitated due to an illness. What kind of illness?

Angelica: Forget it. Let’s say instead that it happ ened because of an act of God.

Corey: Like a lightning strike? That’s not very lik ely.

Angelica: Okay, how about some problem with the fli ght crew that caused the cabin to depressurize and the plane to go into a ta ilspin.

Corey: What was the problem with the fight crew?

Angelica: It doesn’t matter!

Corey: Maybe a member of the flight crew was a hija cker and it was an act of terrorism.

Angelica: Okay, let’s say that’s what happened. Hap py?

Corey: But wait! Who was the terrorist? What were h is aims and what was his cause?

Angelica: You know what? I think you should put tha t in your book!

Angelica says to Corey, “So the book I’m writing st arts with a plane crash.” Notice Angelica begins the sentence with the word “ so.” “So” has become in English, in many cases nowadays, the same as “um” o r “well” or other, what we call, “filler words” – words people use to begin a sentence that don’t really have any specific meaning. Angelica could have just said , “The book I’m writing starts with a plane crash.” “Plane” (plane) refers to a ma chine that flies in the air. A “plane” usually has two, what we call, “wings” (win gs) which are like arms that extend or go out from the side of the plane.

Now, what you don’t want to happen if you are in a plane is a “crash” (crash). A “crash” is when a plane falls out of the sky or hit s something, and usually bad things follow – bad things happen when that happens  to a plane, when it crashes. The verb “to crash” (crash) is used when a ny kind of vehicle like a plane or a car hits something that it’s not supposed to. In this case, a “plane crash” refers to when a plane usually hits the ground at a  very fast speed and explodes or is damaged in some way. Angelica is writing a bo ok about a plane crash.

Corey asks, “What caused it?” meaning “Why did the plane crash?” The “cause” (cause) of something is the reason something happen ed. Angelica says, “It doesn’t matter,” meaning it’s not important. “That’ s not part of the story,” she says. Corey says, however, that the “characters hav e back stories, so you should have a backstory for the plane crash.” The word “ba ckstory” (backstory) refers to

the information about a character or someone in a b ook, play, movie, or TV show before they appear in the story.

So it’s, if you will, the history of that character , of that person in the story, before the story begins. Now why is backstory important? W ell, because in order to understand a story, every character, every person i n the story, needs to have some sort of history, some sort of reason why they do what they do or why they are in the story, and so the backstory is the story  of the characters, of the people in a story, before the story begins. I hope that ma kes sense.

“Backstory” is one of those words that gets used a lot here in Los Angeles, where of course many of the movies and television shows a re written – often at some of the cafés I go to. Every time I go to a café here i n Los Angeles, there’s usually someone working on a “script” (script). A script is  the dialogue, or what the people say, in a movie or a TV show.

Corey is saying that the plane crash needs to have a backstory. There needs to be a reason for it that is somehow part of the stor y or the book that Angelica is writing. Angelica says, “Okay, the plane crashed be cause of mechanical failure, or better yet, pilot error.” “Mechanical” (mechanic al) refers to something in a machine or something related to a machine. “Failure ” (failure) is when something goes wrong, when there’s a problem with something. “Mechanical failure” would be when something goes wrong with some part of the plane.

Angelica says, “The plane crashed because of mechan ical failure.” But then she comes up with another reason: “Or better yet,” she says, “pilot error.” The phrase “better yet” (yet) is used when you have a better i dea than the one you just mentioned. In this case, Angelica first says the pl ane crashed because of mechanical failure, and then she thinks of a better  reason. So she says, “better yet, pilot (pilot) error (error).”

The “pilot” is the person who is in charge of or wh o is guiding the plane, usually in the front of the plane. There are often two peop le in front of the plane, the “pilot” and what we call the “copilot” (copilot). T he copilot is the person who helps the pilot fly the plane, or who flies the plane if the pilot is not able to. “Error” (error) is when something goes wrong, or in this ca se when a person makes a mistake – when a person “errs” (errs). So, “pilot e rror” would be when a pilot makes a mistake, which of course we don’t want to h appen.

Corey says, “What happened? Was it because the pilo t misread the instruments or had a problem navigating?” Corey is trying to fi nd out more about why Angelica’s pilot made a mistake in her book. One re ason could be that the pilot

“misread” (misread). “To misread” (the past tense i s spelled the same but pronounced differently – “misread”) means to read o r look at something but not do it carefully, do it in such a way that you make a mistake.

“Instruments” refer to things on the airplane, in t his case, that indicate or show how the plane is doing – how high the plane is flyi ng, what direction the plane is flying in, and so forth. So, if a pilot “misreads” the instruments on the plane, the pilot is not looking carefully enough and getting t he wrong information, if you will, from the instruments, or not the correct informatio n. Corey also suggests that perhaps the pilot had a problem “navigating.” “To n avigate” (navigate) means to determine which direction you are going in a car, b oat, or a plane.

Angelica doesn’t have an answer to Corey. She says,  “I don’t know.” She doesn’t know, of course, because she’s just inventing these  things as she’s talking. She’s just making them up, which of course is what all au thors, all writers do, but Angelica hasn’t thought about it very carefully. Co rey then says, “Maybe he or she,” referring to the pilot, “was incapacitated du e to illness.” “To be incapacitated” (incapacitated) means to be unable t o use your body or perhaps your brain because you are either sick or injured.

If you are “incapacitated due to an accident,” beca use of an accident, you may be unable to walk, for example. You may have broken  your legs. That would be a case of being “incapacitated” – unable to do what y ou normally do. “Capacitated” comes from the word “capability,” which is “able to  do something.” So, “incapacitated” is “not able to do something.”

Angelica isn’t interested in this discussion. She s ays, “Let’s say instead,” in place of the reason she’s already given, “that it happene d” – that is, the plane crashed – “because of an act of God.” The phrase “act of Go d” usually refers to an event that people have no control over, that wasn’t cause d by anything human beings can do or have done, such as a flood or an earthqua ke or a hurricane. These are also sometimes called “natural disasters” – things that happen that are not caused by human beings.

Corey says, “Like a lightning strike?” He’s giving an example of an “act of God,” and one of those examples is a “lightning (lightnin g) strike (strike).” “Lightning” refers to an exchange of electricity either within clouds above in the sky, or between the earth and a cloud. Usually there’s a lo ud sound which we call “thunder” (thunder) that you hear after lightning. “Lightning” is usually indicated by a bright flash of light. Corey says a lightning strike is not a very likely or probable thing that would cause a plane crash.

Angelica then changes her mind again. She says, “Ok ay, how about some problem with the flight crew that caused the cabin to depressurize and the plane to go into a tailspin.” The “flight crew” (crew) re fers to the people who work on the airplane – not just the pilots but also the people in the back part of the plane who are giving you drinks and making sure everyone stay s in his or her seat. The “cabin” (cabin) refers to the main part of the plan e where everyone sits. The cabin is where most people in the plane sit. The very front of the plane where the pilots are is  usually called the “cockpit” (cockpit).

So, you have the “cabin,” which is where everyone s its other than the pilots, who are in the “cockpit” in the front of the plane. If the cabin “depressurizes,” it loses the pressure that is normally inside of a plane tha t allows you to be able to breathe in the plane. When a plane goes up very hig h in the sky, it has to be pressurized in order to allow people inside of the cabin to breathe normally, but if it “depressurizes,” that can cause the plane to cra sh.

One way a plane can crash is to go into a “tailspin ” (tailspin). A tailspin is when a plane falls from the sky down to the ground, often by spinning around in a circle. Angelica suggests that the plane crashed because the flight crew did something to cause the cabin to depressurize and the plane we nt into a tailspin. Corey says, “What was the problem with the flight crew?” Angeli ca is getting impatient. She says, “It doesn’t matter!” meaning it’s not importa nt. She said that already, of course, earlier in the dialogue.

Corey then comes up with another possible reason for the plane to crash. He says, “Maybe a member of the flight crew was a hija cker and it was an act of terrorism.” A “hijacker” (hijacker) is a person who  uses violence or some other threat to take control, usually of an airplane, in order to do something bad – sometimes to get money, other times to escape from the authorities (people who may want to arrest that person), or sometimes to ca use damage with the plane itself. An “act of terrorism” refers to any violenc e that is done in order to make people afraid or to try to achieve some sort of pol itical or military goal. We are all sadly aware of acts of terrorism nowadays.

Angelica says, “Okay, let’s say that’s what happene d. Happy?” meaning “Are you happy now that I have taken your reason as the back story for the plane crash?” Corey apparently is not happy. He says, “But wait! Who is the terrorist? What were his aims” – that is, what was he trying to acc omplish, what was he trying to do – “and what was his cause?” meaning what was his  political motivation for doing what he was doing.

 Angelica says, “You know what? I think you should p ut that in your book!” Angelica is telling Corey that he should write his own book and he can put all of that information, all of these reasons, into his ow n book, and he should stop trying to make Angelica think of reasons for the pl ane crash for her book.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
