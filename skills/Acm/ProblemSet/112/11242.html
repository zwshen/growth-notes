A racing bicycle is driven by a chain connecting two sprockets.
Sprockets are grouped into two clusters:  the front cluster 
(typically consisting of 2 or 3 sprockets) and the rear cluster
(typically consisting of between 5 and 10 sprockets).  At any
time the chain connects one of the front sprockets to one
of the rear sprockets.  The drive ratio -- the ratio of the
angular velocity of the pedals to that of the wheels -- is
n:m where n is the number of teeth on the rear sprocket and
m is the number of teeth on the front sprocket.
Two drive ratios  d<sub>1</sub>&lt;d<sub>2</sub> are adjacent
if there is no other drive ratio  d<sub>1</sub>&lt;d<sub>3</sub>&lt;d<sub>2</sub>.
The <i>spread</i> between a pair of drive ratios d<sub>1</sub>&lt;d<sub>2</sub> is
their quotient:  d<sub>2</sub>/d<sub>1</sub>.
You are to compute the maximum spread between two adjacent
drive ratios achieved by a particular pair of front and
rear clusters.
<p>
Input consists of several test cases, followed by a line containing 0.
Each test case is specified by the following input:
<ul>
<li>f:  the number of sprockets in the front cluster;
<li>r:  the number of sprockets in the rear cluster;
<li>f integers, each giving the number of teeth on one of the gears in the front cluster;
<li>r integers, each giving the number of teeth on one of the gears in the rear cluster.
</ul>
You may assume that no cluster has more than 10 sprockets and
that no gear has fewer than 10 or more than 100 teeth.
<p>
For each test case, output the maximum spread rounded
to two decimal places.
