This episode is called “Buying Glasses.”  We’re going to li sten to a dialogue between Alice and Pierre talking about someone who nee ds to buy some eyeglasses.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alice:  Ooh, look at these!  Don’t I look great?  I’ve always wanted sunglasses like these.

Pierre:  You’re supposed to be here helping me pick ou t frames for my new bifocals.

Alice:  I don’t know why you won’t get progressives.  Tha t’s what everybody is getting these days.

Pierre:  I’ve always had bifocals and that’s what I’m go ing to get.

Alice:  Are you going to get metal, plastic, or rimless f rames?

Pierre:  I’m not sure.  The optician said that with my prescription, I could get any kind.

Alice:  Okay, try these.  How do they feel?

Pierre:  I like the way the hinges move, but they’re to o small for my head.  Hey, these are nice.  I think I’ll go with these.

 Alice:  There’s no accounting for taste!  Okay, but what a bout the lenses?  There are so many options.  You can get ones that reduce glare,  ones that darken automatically, ones with anti-scratch coating…

Pierre:  I want to keep it nice and simple.  I don’t want any of those options.

Alice:  How about these for a backup pair?  They’re desi gner frames.

Pierre:  Give me those.  I should have known better th an to let you tag along. What was I thinking?!

Alice says to Pierre, “Ooh, look at these!  Don’t I look g reat?  I’ve always wanted sunglasses like these.”  “Don’t I look great?” of course, me ans I look great in these, don’t I, asking for the other person to agree.  Alice says that she’s always wanted sunglasses like these.  “Sunglasses” are glasses we use t o protect our eyes from very bright sunshine.

Pierre says, “You’re supposed to be here helping me pick o ut frames for my new bifocals.”  Pierre is saying that Alice is supposed to be h elping him pick out frames.  “Frames” are the metal or plastic part of your  glasses that hold in what we call the “lenses,” the things that you see through, m ade of glass or plastic. The frames can be metal or plastic, and they go behind y our ear so that they stay up – so that they stay in place.

Pierre needs to get bifocals.  “Bifocals” are glasses that have two sections with a small line separating them.  The largest section is for se eing distance; that is, seeing things that are far away.  And, bifocals typically have reading glasses, or a reading section in the glasses.  That’s a smaller sectio n of the lens which you use to read.  So, you can have one pair of glasses to do t wo different things. “Bi,” of course, means two.  I have bifocals, so I can see f ar, when I’m driving for example, and I also can see close up when I’m reading.

Alice says to Pierre, “I don’t know why you won’t get prog ressives.” “Progressives” is a special kind of glasses that have two or t hree sections.  There is a section on the top that helps you see far away, a secti on in the middle of the lens that helps you see a medium distance – not too far, not too close, and then there’s a section that helps you see things close, for exa mple when you’re reading.  The difference is that progressives don’t have a little line that separates the different parts of the lens, whereas a bifocal wou ld.  “Progressive” has a

 couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Alice says, “everybody is getting progressives these days (nowada ys).”  Pierre says, “I’ve always had bifocals and that’s what I’m going t o get.”  Alice asks him, “Are you going to get metal, plastic, or rimless frames? ”  “Metal” is something that is hard; a material made of iron, steel, aluminu m, those would all be metals. Silver, gold, and nickel are also metals.  “Plastic” is a st rong material that is made by taking petroleum (oil) and making it into a hard ob ject.  “Rimless glasses” are glasses that don’t have any edges.  The lens – remember t he lens is the part of the glasses that you see out of – that you look out of –  they are attached to the frames, but there is not any plastic or metal around the  actual glass or plastic lenses, so it looks like you just have these two lenses sitting  in front of your eyes. The “rim” (rim) of the glasses are the parts that go ar ound the lens – the edge of the lenses.  “Rimless” would be without a rim, and that ’s what rimless glasses are.

Well, Pierre says, “I’m not sure.  The optician said that  with my prescription, I could get any kind (I could get frames that are metal, p lastic, or rimless).”  The “optician” is the person who makes the glasses, puts the gl asses together, and helps people put on the glasses.  Usually if you are goin g to have your eyes checked, you go to a doctor called an “optometrist,” but i f you are just buying glasses, then you would go to an optician.  The optician is not a doctor; it is a person who knows about how glasses are made and helps you se lect a pair and put them on your face.  When you have your eyes examined b y the optometrist and they determine you need glasses, you are given somethin g called a “prescription,” which is a piece of paper where the doct or writes down what kind of glasses you need.  We use that same word if a doctor is giving you some sort of drug; they would write down the name of the medici ne.  That’s your “prescription,” it’s the piece of paper that has that i nformation, usually with the doctor’s signature, that you then bring in order to ge t your glasses or your drugs.

Alice says, “Okay, try these.  How do they feel?”  Pierre sa ys, “I like the way the hinges move, but they’re too small for my head.”  A “hin ge” (hinge) is a small piece of metal that connects two larger pieces of wood,  plastic, or metal.  If you have a door in your house, there are at least two hinge s.  The door opens and closes, but there’s a metal plate that connects the door to the wall, and that allows you to open the door.  So the hinge opens and cl oses; it’s flexible.  Your glasses have hinges – if you have glasses – that connect the lens part of the glasses – the lens part of the frame with the pieces of t he frame that go on either side of your head and behind your ears.  So, Pierre like s the hinges on the pair of glasses that Alice showed him, but he says they’re too small  for his head.

 Obviously, he has a very big head!  “Hinge” has a couple of  meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Pierre says, “Hey, these are nice.  I’ll go with these,” meaning I’ll select these. Alice says, “There’s no accounting for taste!”  The expression  “there’s no accounting for taste” is used to show that you don’t like  another person’s choice of style or fashion.  To say “there’s no accounting for” m eans there’s no way to explain.  So, everyone has different tastes – a different  sense of style and fashion.

Alice doesn’t like Pierre’s taste; she obviously doesn’t like the pair of glasses that Pierre is trying on.  Alice says, “Okay, but what about the  lenses?” the clear, plastic, or glass pieces that you see through.  You also ca ll that clear piece of plastic or glass in a camera a lens.  Alice says, “There are  so many options.  You can get lenses that reduce glare, ones that darken auto matically, ones with anti- scratch coating.”  “Glare” (glare) is a bright light tha t is reflected off of a piece of glass or plastic.  If you have glasses that reduce glare – t hey make it less, that means you won’t have that problem with the bright like reflecting off the glass or the plastic.  It’s also possible to get lenses that darken a utomatically, so instead of having a pair of glasses that you use inside the house and another pair of sunglasses that you use outside, you can get lenses that will  automatically darken when you go outside into the light.  I had these  for a few years when I was in high school, but they were rather inconvenient beca use it takes a while for the lenses to darken and to brighten up – to un-darken , so they weren’t very convenient in my opinion.  Lenses can also have anti-scratch co ating.  A “scratch” is when you make a mark on a piece of glass or pla stic that you don’t want; you can also scratch, for example the back of a watch o r the front of a watch.  “Coating” is something that goes over something e lse, usually to protect it.  So, “anti-scratch coating” is a special chemical they p ut over the glass – over the lenses that prevents it from getting scratched.

Pierre says however, “I want to keep it nice and simple,” meaning very simple.  “I don’t want any of those options.”  Alice says, “How about these for a backup pair?  They’re designer frames.”  Something that “backs u p” something else is something that you use in case the first thing doesn’t wo rk or the first thing doesn’t operate properly.  If you have a computer, you should also have another external disk drive or some sort of online service that backs up your files.  Notice it can be used as a verb as well: “to backup.”  I back up  my files every day on an external hard drive.  “Backup pair” refers to a pair of glasses that you use in case your first ones break or you have a problem with them.

 Alice is looking at a pair of designer frames.  “Designer ” means that they are made by a company; they’re usually of a certain style or shap e and they’re usually more expensive.  So if you buy a dress made and desi gned by Versace, for example, or you buy something made by Prada, these are designer products; they are things that have a very special and unique sort of design to them.

Pierre says, “Give me those.  I should have known better th an to let you tag along.  What was I thinking?!”  “To tag” (tag) – some would pronounce it “tag,” but in my Minnesota accent it’s “tag” – “to tag along” means to go with someone somewhere they’re going even though you are not invited  initially or the person is going even if you don’t go with them.  So, if your old er brother is going to the movies you may say, “Can I tag along?” meaning can I go wi th you, you didn’t invite me but I’d like to go.  In this case, Alice tags al ong with Pierre to buy some glasses.  Pierre is wishing that he never invited her to co me with him.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
