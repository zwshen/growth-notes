On this episode, we’re going to listen to Angela an d Juan talk about children who get hurt playing sports. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Angela: Wait! I need to put sunscreen on Davy befor e he goes to the game.

Juan: It’s not sunny today. He doesn’t need sunscre en.

Angela: And here are four water bottles to make sur e he stays hydrated and doesn’t get heatstroke.

Juan: One of the other parents is bringing drinks f or the kids. It’s fine. We don’t need that.

Angela: Make sure Davy warms up and cools down befo re and after the game. I don’t want him to strain or sprain anything.

Juan: The coach makes sure they do that. Are you do ne?

Angela: And here’s a first-aid kit in case he skins  his knee or gets any other scrapes. We don’t want to risk infection.

Juan: The reason we signed up Davy for organized sp orts is that all of this is taken care of. There’s even a certified athletic tr ainer at each game, one of the parents.

Angela: But the other kids can be so rough. He come s home with bruises all the time. I can’t stand seeing him hurt.

Juan: Do you want to come to the game? You can see for yourself that everything is fine.

Angela: How can I watch Davy running into danger? I ’d want to run onto the field and save him.

Juan: You’re right. It’s better that you stay here.  If you did that, your son would never live it down!

[end of dialogue]

Angela begins our dialogue by saying, “Wait! I need  to put sunscreen on Davy before he goes to the game.” Davy, we learn, is a c hild. Angela wants to put “sunscreen” (sunscreen) on him. Sunscreen is a crea m or a liquid that you put on your skin to prevent getting sunburnt – to prevent sunburn, the redness of your skin that is caused by too much sun. People like me , who come from a northern European climate originally (my ancestors, anyway),  have to be very careful about sunscreen because I, like many of my fellow I rishmen, often get sunburnt when we go out and stay in the sun too long.

Juan says, however, “It’s not sunny today. He doesn ’t need sunscreen.” Juan says the sun isn’t even shining today. You don’t ha ve to worry about that. Angela, however, continues, “And here are four wate r bottles to make sure he stays hydrated and doesn’t get heatstroke.” “To be hydrated” (hydrated) means to have enough water so that you don’t get sick.

“Heatstroke” (stroke) is a dangerous medical condit ion caused by the human body getting too hot, and that can happen if you are out in the sun and if you’re not drinking water – at least, that’s what Angela t hinks. Juan says, “One of the other parents is bringing drinks for the kids.” In other words, Davy doesn’t need to bring his own water. One of the other parents wi ll bring water.

Angela says, “Make sure Davy warms up and cools dow n before and after the game.” What Angela means here is that she wants Dav y to warm up before the game and cool down after the game. “To warm up” her e refers to gradually increasing your physical activity before exercising  or playing some sort of sport. Many athletes – people who play sports – warm up be fore the main activity or the main thing they are doing in their exercising or in  their sporting activity.

“To cool down” is to gradually decrease your physic al activity when you have finished exercising or playing a sport. Angela expl ains, “I don’t want him to strain or sprain anything.” “To strain” (strain) means to stretch a muscle so far that you hurt it. You might actually even “tear” (tear) the muscle, which is basically ripping the muscle or causing the muscle to break in some w ay.

“To sprain” (sprain) means to stretch not a muscle,  but what’s called a “ligament.” A “ligament” (ligament) is a tissue, a part of your  body, that connects bones. Juan says, “The coach makes sure they do that.” The “coa ch” (coach) is the person whose job it is to help an athlete or a team perfor m well and ultimately to win the game that the team or the person is playing.

I can never hear the word “coach” without thinking of my father. The reason is this: my father was a gym teacher, a physical educa tion teacher. He was the teacher in school that taught the kids games and he lped them participate in sporting events. Well, he taught in a somewhat smal l school, a special school, and he was known by all of the children and the adu lts in the school simply as “Coach.” That’s what they called him. They didn’t s ay “Mr. McQuillan.” They said “Coach.”

I remember as a child going to his school with him one day and hearing the teachers address him, or talk to him, with the name  “Coach.” “Hey, Coach. How is it going today?” “How are you doing, Coach?” I t hought, “Why are they calling my father ‘Coach’?” But that’s what they called him  for the 34 years that he taught in the St. Paul public schools. But back to our story.

Juan says to Angela, “Are you done?” meaning “Have you finished giving me things and instructing me?” He wants to get going to take Davy to his game. Angela, however, is not finished. She says, “And he re’s a first-aid kit in case he skins his knee or gets any other scrapes. We don’t want to risk infection.” A “first- aid (aid) kit (kit)” is a small box that has basic medical supplies in it. It’s something that you would have at a sporting event o r a game like this in case you needed to take care of any small medical issues .

One of the things that might happen in a sporting g ame would be “skinning your knee.” “To skin (skin) your knee (knee)” is to caus e the skin around or near your knee to break and to “bleed” (bleed). “To bleed” is  to allow blood or to have blood come out of your body. Angela is worried that littl e Davy is going to skin his knee or get another kind of “scrape” (scrape). A scrape is also an injury to your skin. We might also call it a “cut” or a “scratch” that is caused by having the skin rub up against or touch a sharp surface or object.

Angela says, “We don’t want to risk infection.” “To  risk” something is to take the chance that something bad will happen. The bad thin g in this case is an “infection” (infection). An infection is when there  is something in your body that is causing you pain or making you ill.

Juan says, “The reason we signed up Davy for organi zed sports is that all of this is taken care of.” Juan is saying to Angela that th ey “signed Davy up,” meaning they agreed to have Davy participate in this activi ty, because “all of this is taken care of,” meaning all of these problems that Angela  is worried about will be taken care of by the organization that is running this pa rticular sporting activity.

“Organized sports” refers to athletic activity, usu ally involving teens, that is coordinated and organized by some organizations, so me group of people. Juan says, “There’s even a certified athletic trainer at  each game, one of the parents.” A “certified athletic trainer” (trainer) would be s omeone who has some medical knowledge or qualifications that would be sufficien t to take care of minor injuries and problems that might happen to one of the player s in the game.

Angela is not convinced. She says, “But the other k ids can be so rough.” “To be rough” (rough) means to, in this case, play a physi cal activity or participate in a physical activity that might cause someone to get h urt. Really, it means to play in such a way or in such a manner that would result in  someone getting hurt. It can cause people to get injured or hurt – even killed s ometimes.

Angela continues, “He comes home with bruises all the time. I can’t stand seeing him hurt.” “Bruises” (bruises) are temporary discol ored areas on your skin, usually circles of purple or dark green that are ca used by someone hitting himself or someone getting hit, more likely by another pers on. If, for example, I take my hand and close it up into a ball called a “fist” an d hit you hard, it might cause a bruise. Later on, your skin may turn a different co lor, a dark color.

Angela is complaining that Davy often comes home fr om these games with bruises. Juan says, “Do you want to come to the gam e? You can see for yourself that everything is fine.” Angela says, “How can I w atch Davy running into danger? I’d want to run out onto the field and save  him.” Angela says she can’t go to the game and watch Davy because if she did, s he would go out and try to protect her son during the game. Juan then says, “Y ou’re right. It’s better that you stay here. If you did that,” meaning if you went to  the game and tried to protect Davy, “your son will never live it down.”

“To live (live) something down” means to have somet hing embarrassing happen to you and then try to continue on with your normal  life – when you hope other

people have finally forgotten about this embarrassi ng moment that you have. Usually when we use this expression, it’s with the word “never.” “I will never live that down.” That means that you did something embar rassing or something embarrassing happened to you that everyone will alw ays remember. No one will forget.

Now of course, most people do forget, and we usuall y worry about our embarrassing moments more than we should. What Juan  means here in the dialogue is that if Angela, Davy’s mother, would go  to a game and do what she said she might do, which is run out onto the playin g field to protect her son, her son would never live that down. Her son would alway s be embarrassed by what his mother had done.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
