<H1 align="center">Re-connecting Computer Sites</H1>
</font>

<P align="justify"> 

Consider the problem of selecting a set <i>T</i> of high-speed lines for 
connecting <i>N</i> computer sites, from a universe of <i>M</i>
high-speed lines each connecting a pair of computer sites. Each
high-speed line has a given monthly cost, and the objective is to
minimize the total cost of connecting the <i>N</i> computer sites,
where the total cost is the sum of the cost of each line included in
set <i>T</i>. Consider further that this problem has been solved
earlier for the set of <i>N</i> computer sites and <i>M</i> high-speed
lines, but that a few <i>K</i> new high-speed lines have recently
become available. <p>

<P align="justify"> 
Your objective is to compute the new set <i>T'</i> that may yield a
cost lower than the original set <i>T</i>, due to the additional
<i>K</i> new high-speed lines and when <i>M+K</i> high-speed lines are
available.

<P align="justify">
<b>
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.
Consecutive test cases are separated by a single blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>
 
The input is organized as  follows:
<ul>
  <li> A line containing the number <i>N</i> of computer sites, with
  <i>1 <= N <= 1000000</i>, and where each computer site is referred
  by a number <i>i</i>, <i>1 <= i <= N</i>.

  <li> The set <i>T</i> of previously chosen high-speed lines,
  consisting of <i>N-1</i> lines, each describing a high-speed line,
  and containing the numbers of the two computer sites the line
  connects and the monthly cost of using this line. All costs are
  integers.

  <li> A line containing the number <i>K</i> of new additional lines,
  <i>1 <= K <= 10</i>.

  <li> <i>K</i> lines, each describing a new high-speed line, and
  containing the numbers of the two computer sites the line connects
  and the monthly cost of using this line. All costs are integers.

  <li> A line containing the number <i>M</i> of originally available
  high-speed lines, with <i>N-1 <= M <= N (N-1) / 2</i>.

  <li> <i>M</i> lines, each describing one of the originally available
  high-speed lines, and containing the numbers of the two computer
  sites the line connects and the monthly cost of using this line. All
  costs are integers.
</ul>


<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>


<P align="justify">
The output file must have one line containing the original cost of
connecting the <i>N</i> computer sites with <i>M</i> high-speed lines
and another line containing the new cost of connecting the <i>N</i>
computer sites with <i>M+K</i> high-speed lines. If the new cost
equals the original cost, the same value is written twice.
