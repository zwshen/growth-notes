This episode is going to be a dialogue between Jogi  and Deborah about having to deal with, or have an interaction with, a large organization. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jogi: I knew when we got this government contract t hat it would be a two-edged sword.

Deborah: How so?

Jogi: I’m grateful for the work, but having to jump  through hoops of the government’s bureaucracy has me pulling my hair out .

Deborah: What’s wrong now?

Jogi: You know that all of our documents have to be  submitted in triplicate. I anticipated that and had done everything to the let ter, or so I thought.

Deborah: I know. I helped you prepare those documen ts. What’s the problem?

Jogi: The documents were sent back to us because th ey say we didn’t follow some of the reporting regulations. But the verbiage  in the regulations is so convoluted that I had to interpret them to the best  of my ability. I thought I had done everything right.

Deborah: Didn’t they tell you what they thought was  done wrong when they returned the documents?

Jogi: All I got was a form letter with no specifics .

Deborah: I suggest calling the office responsible f or reviewing the documents and asking someone there.

Jogi: You don’t think I’ve tried? Each time I think  I have the right department and leave a voicemail message, either I don’t hear back  or I get palmed off on another office. I can’t get a straight answer to an y of my questions. I never expected this much red tape.

Deborah: So I see what you mean about that two-edge d sword.

Jogi: I can think of one good use for that sword ri ght now – to put me out of my misery!

This episode is called “Dealing with Bureaucracy.” “Bureaucracy” is a large, usually complicated organizational system, or compl icated and complex organization that has a lot of different requiremen ts, often involving what we call “paperwork” – filling out forms, submitting documen ts, that sort of thing.

Almost every government has a large bureaucracy, a complicated system of offices and departments and “bureaus,” which is jus t another name for a division of the government. We can also have a bureaucracy i n a large company, but usually we associate it with the government and wit h “inefficiency” – with not being a very fast or efficient way to do something.

This dialogue is about dealing with bureaucracy, an d it begins with Jogi saying, “I knew when I got this government contract that it wo uld be a two-edged sword.” A “contract” is a legal agreement, an official agreem ent, between two people or two organizations, each promising to do something for t he other.

Jogi has a contract with the government, but he cal ls it a “two-edged sword.” “Two-edged” (edged) refers to a knife or some sharp  object that is sharp on both sides. A “sword” (sword) is like a large knife that  you would use to fight someone or kill someone. The meaning of the phrase, however , is that this is a situation that has some advantages and some disadvantages – s ome good things and some bad things.

Having a government contract is, according to Jogi,  “a two-edged sword,” meaning there are good things about it and there are bad things about it.

Deborah says, “How so?” “How so?” means “How is it a two-edged sword?” in this case. We use this question “How so?” when we want someone to give us a more detailed explanation. Jogi does that. He says,  “I’m grateful” – I’m thankful – “for the work, but having to jump through hoops of the government’s bureaucracy has me pulling my hair out.”

The phrase “to jump through hoops” (hoops) means to  have to do many different small, often difficult tasks that don’t seem to hav e any real purpose, but that are required to get what you want. Government agencies and offices often require that you fill out lots of forms. You give them this  piece of paper, you give them this piece of information – it seems like they’re a sking you to do a lot of little things that don’t seem necessary.

This would be “jumping through hoops” – having to f ulfill or go through a lot of different requirements in order to get what you wan t. A “hoop” is a circular piece of metal or wood that can be used for lots of diffe rent things. We have what’s called a “basketball hoop,” which is the place wher e you throw the ball through – it’s the round circle that the basketball has to go  through in order to score a point. I’m guessing this phrase comes from the activity th at you might see at a circus, for example, where they have dogs or other small an imals that jump through the circle. They have to jump through these hoops as pa rt of the activity that is supposed to be entertaining, I guess. That’s just a  guess. I’m not sure if that’s exactly where we get this expression, but that woul d make sense. The important thing is that it refers to having to do a lot of sm all, often seemingly unnecessary things in order to get what you want.

Jogi is talking about jumping through the hoops of the government’s bureaucracy. This has him “pulling his hair out.” “ To pull your hair out” means to be very frustrated, to be very annoyed. You’re so f rustrated, you’re so mad at a certain situation, that you pull on the hair of you r head with your hand so hard that you pull it out.

Of course, you’re not actually pulling out your hai r, although I used to teach high school here in the United States – high school stud ents between the ages of 14 and 18 – and I used to have a lot of hair, and now if you see a photograph of me, or a video, you will see that I don’t have any hair . That’s because teaching high school caused me to pull my hair out, it was so fru strating. That’s not true. I like teaching high school, for a while.

In our episode, Jogi doesn’t like having to jump th rough the hoops of the government’s bureaucracy. Deborah says, “What’s wro ng now?” Jogi says, “You know that all of our documents have to be submitted  in triplicate.” “Triplicate”

(triplicate) means three copies of the document. “T ri-” as a prefix means three. So, three copies of every document have to be submi tted to the government.

Jogi says, “I anticipated that and had done everyth ing to the letter, or so I thought.” Jogi says he “anticipated that.” He knew that was going to happen, and so he had a plan for it. He thought he had “done ev erything to the letter.” “To the letter” here means exactly, precisely, the exact wa y the government wanted him to do it. But at the end of the sentence he says, “ So I thought,” meaning that’s what I thought, but obviously that isn’t true.

Deborah says, “I know. I helped you prepare those d ocuments. What’s the problem?” Jogi says, “The documents were sent back to us” – were returned to us – “because they,” meaning the government, “they say we didn’t follow some of the reporting regulations” – some of the rules – “b ut the verbiage in the regulations is so convoluted that I had to interpre t them to the best of my ability.”

“Verbiage” (verbiage) refers to a lot of words, too  many words, that are often confusing or unclear. It’s a negative way of descri bing, in this case, some sort of official document that has lots of different langua ge that doesn’t make a lot of sense. This is something you will often see in a le gal document. That’s why we have lawyers – so that they can charge you a lot of  money to tell you what it means.

In the case of Jogi, the regulations are, according  to him, “convoluted,” or at least the language that the regulations are expressed in is convoluted. “Convoluted” (convoluted) means very complicated, very complex, very difficult to understand. Jogi is trying to interpret, trying to understand, these regulations to the best of his ability. If you say you do something “to the best of your ability,” you mean you’re doing it as best as you can, as well as you can.

Deborah says, “Didn’t they tell you what they thoug ht was done wrong when they returned the documents?” That is, didn’t the govern ment say where you did this wrong and this wrong and this wrong? Jogi says, “Al l I got” – the only thing I received – “was a form letter with no specifics.” A  “form (form) letter” is a letter that is written usually by a government agency or a  large company that is sent to a lot of different people with a similar problem. I t’s not specifically written for you. It’s a letter they use for lots of different people  who have whatever problem you have.

Deborah says, “I suggest calling the office respons ible for reviewing,” or looking at, “the documents and asking someone there.” Debor ah says well, just call them up. Of course, that doesn’t often work with the gov ernment. Jogi says, “You don’t

think I tried?” meaning I’ve already tried that. I’ ve already done that, of course. Jogi says, “Each time I think I have the right” – t he correct – “department and leave a voicemail message, either I don’t hear back  or I get palmed off on another office.”

Jogi calls what he thinks is the correct office. He  leaves a message, but then he doesn’t hear back. “To hear back” means to receive a response from your message – either your email or your telephone messa ge. The phrase “to be palmed (palmed) off” means that you are passed to a nother person or department. For example, if you go and ask someone a question in a government office and the person says to you, “Oh n o, you have to go to that office,” you’re being “palmed off.” You’re being ha nded to another department.

One of the meanings of this expression is that the person with whom you speak originally doesn’t really want to deal with you, do esn’t want to handle the problem, so they’re going to give you to someone el se because they don’t want to do the work. That could be one reason why you are “palmed off.” “Palm” (palm) is the part of your hand that is between you r wrist and your fingers – the inside part of your hand.

Jogi says, “I can’t get a straight answer to any of  my questions.” A “straight (straight) answer” is a clear, direct, honest answe r. Jogi can’t get a straight answer to any of his questions. He then says, “I ne ver expected this much red tape.” The expression “red tape” means a lot of rul es and regulations that have to be followed that are required by usually a governme nt organization. These are often considered unnecessary or even silly regulati ons that you have to follow, rules that somebody created that don’t really have any good purpose.

Deborah says, “So, I see what you mean about that t wo-edged sword.” Deborah is saying that she understands why Jogi described h is government contract as a “two-edged sword,” with pluses and minuses. Jogi sa ys, “I can think of one good use for that sword right now – to put me out of my misery.”

Remember we said a sword is basically a weapon that  you can use to cut or kill someone. The expression “to put someone out of his misery” (misery) means to kill someone as an act of kindness, someone who’s s uffering. If you have a dog that’s very sick, you might want to put the dog out  of its misery. “Misery” is suffering, is pain, so you’re trying to stop the do g from suffering.

Here, of course, Jogi is joking. He doesn’t really want to kill himself. He just wants to no longer suffer the pain of dealing with a bureaucracy.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
