[start of dialogue]

Julianna: Ha ha! The wicked witch is dead!

Hugo: What are you talking about?

Julianna: Bettina is stepping down as chairperson o f the committee. I thought this day would never come.

Hugo: That’s a big surprise. I never thought I’d li ve to see the day when Bettina would willingly give up her position.

Julianna: It wasn’t her choice exactly. The rest of  the committee forced her out, saying they couldn’t work with her anymore. Oh how the mighty have fallen!

Hugo: But I thought she had the support of the high er-ups and they wanted her in the position.

Julianna: Well, she’s somehow fallen from grace and  they can’t wait to see the back of her. It’s nice to see her get her comeuppan ce – finally!

Hugo: Maybe we’re not getting the full story. Maybe  she had personal reasons for leaving.

Julianna: Whatever the reason, we’ll be rid of her once and for all. Hallelujah!

Hugo: How do you know the next chairperson won’t be  worse?

Julianna: Bite your tongue!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Julianna saying, “Ha ha! T he wicked witch is dead!” The “wicked (wicked) witch (witch)” is a reference to a famous movie from the 1930’s called The Wizard of Oz . In the movie, there was an evil or bad character who was called the “Wicked Witch.” A “witch” is a w oman who is said to have magical powers. “To be wicked” means to be bad. It' s an old word for someone who is bad.

So, a “wicked witch” would be an evil witch, in thi s case, an evil woman. Now, one of the lines in the movie, I don't want to tell  you what happens at the end of the movie, but one of the lines in the movie is “Th e wicked witch is dead!” We're guessing that Julianna is referring to someone who is not a witch, and is probably not dead, but in this case, is no longer in their p osition. And that's what Hugo asks her about.

Hugo says “What are you talking about?” Julianna sa ys, “Bettina is stepping down as chairperson of the committee.” “To step dow n” is a two-word phrasal verb, meaning to voluntarily leave your position. Y ou could be the president of a company and then decide to “step down,” to resign, to leave your position.

Julianna says that “Bettina is stepping down as cha irperson of the committee.” We’re not sure what the committee is, but the Betti na is the chairperson. Since Bettina is a woman, we could also call her the “cha irwoman.” Julianna says, “I thought this day would never come.” That expression , “I thought this day would never come,” means you have difficulty believing th at something has actually happened. You wanted it to happen for a very long t ime and now it happens, and you're surprised.

Hugo says, “That's a big surprise. I never thought I'd live to see the day when Bettina would willingly give up her position.” The expression, “I never thought I'd live to see the day,” is similar to the previous ex pression, “I thought this day would never come.” You're saying that you are very surprised that something has actually happened because, again, you were waiting for it for a long time and now it has happened.

Hugo says that he never thought he'd see the day wh en Bettina would willingly, that is, voluntarily, not like being forced, give u p her position. “To give up something” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to de cide no longer to use it, or to stop using something. “I'm going to give up drin king coffee in the mornings.”

I'm going to stop drinking coffee in the mornings. When we use the verb that way, there is this notion of a sacrifice. I'm going to s acrifice voluntarily and give up a certain activity. Here, it means basically to no lo nger be in a position, to resign, to step down.

Julianna says, “It wasn't her choice exactly.” That  means it wasn't voluntary – completely, anyway. That's what Julianna means when  she says, “It wasn't her choice exactly.” “The rest of the committee” – the other members of the committee – “forced her out, saying they couldn't w ork with her anymore.” “To force someone out” is to make someone leave a posit ion either in business or in politics, or in, perhaps, some other position of au thority.

When a politician is forced out of office, he is ma de to resign or leave his position by people who don't want him there. Bettina was for ced out of her position as chairwoman of the committee. Julianna says, “Oh, ho w the mighty have fallen!” This is an old expression that refers to a verse or  a sentence in the Bible describing how someone who was very strong and powe rful suddenly loses their power. “To fall” here means to no longer be powerfu l, to no longer be in your position. “Mighty” (mighty) describes someone who i s powerful, who is strong. So, the expression, “Oh, how the mighty have fallen ” means that someone who is very powerful is now suddenly not powerful.

Hugo says, “But I thought she had the support of the higher-ups.” The expression “the higher-ups” refers to people who are at the to p of an organization in terms of the management, the people who are the leaders or t he bosses. Those of the “higher-ups.” Hugo says he thought Bettina had the support of the higher-ups, of the bosses, and that they wanted her in the positio n.

Julianna says, “Well, she's somehow fallen from gra ce and they can't wait to see the back of her.” “To fall from grace” is to do som ething that makes other people unhappy with you. Another way of saying this would be “to fall out of favor” (favor). “To fall from grace,” or “to fall out of f avor,” is to be in a high position, or a position where you are respected and everyone likes  you, to a position where you do something bad, and now nobody likes you, and  perhaps you've lost your power or your position.

Julianna says that the “higher-ups” – the bosses – “can't wait to see the back of her.” When you “can't wait to” do something, you ve ry much want to do it. You are eager to do it. You want to do it right away, i f possible. In this case, the bosses can't wait to see the back of Bettina. “To s ee the back of someone” means to want to see someone leave. If someone leav es, they turn around and walk away from you and what do you see? You see the  back of that person. So,

the expression “they can't wait to see the back of her” means they are very eager for her to leave. They want her to leave as soon as  possible.

Julianna says, “It's nice to see her get her comeup pance – finally!” This is a somewhat unusual word, “comeuppance” (comeuppance).  “Comeuppance” is a punishment for something that you did wrong. It's s omething that you deserve because you've been doing something wrong, and ther efore need to be punished. It's typically used in referring to peopl e who think they are superior to everyone else, who think they're better than everyo ne else, and then they do something wrong and they lose their power, or they “fall from grace,” we might say. That would be getting your “comeuppance.” You have some sort of punishment for doing something wrong after having t hought that you were better than everyone else.

Hugo says, “Maybe we're not getting the full story. ” The “full story” here means the entire truth, the entire story, everything that  could be known about the situation. Hugo says, “Maybe she had personal reaso ns for leaving.” “Personal reasons” would be perhaps some problem with her fam ily, or she was sick, or something like that, something that was not related  to her job performance.

Julianna says, “Whatever the reason, we’ll be rid o f her once and for all.” “To be rid (rid) of someone” means to no longer have someo ne, or it could also be used to mean to no longer have something, especially som ething that you don't like. “We are now rid of the neighbor next door who had a  loud, barking dog.” The neighbor moved out, left, and now we are “rid of” t hem. We no longer have to have them next to us.

“Once and for all” means finally and completely. We  use this phrase when something has happened that you have been waiting f or, or anticipating, for a long time, and that is now complete and over – “onc e and for all.” Julianna says, “We’ll be rid of Bettina once and for all. Halleluj ah!” “Hallelujah” (hallelujah) is an old phrase, an old word to express joy, happiness, when something very good happens. You'll often see this word used in a relig ious context. “Hallelujah” is wonderful, great, that's what Juilianna means by it .

Hugo says, “How do you know the next chairperson wo n't be worse?” – in other words, the person who comes after Bettina could be worse than Bettina. Julianna says, “Bite your tongue.” That expression, “bite (b ite) your tongue,” means “Stop talking immediately.” We say this when someone is s aying something bad that we don't want to hear, or someone is predicting som ething bad that will happen, and you don't want them to talk about it anymore be cause you don't want it to happen. The phrase can also be used simply to mean to be quiet, to not say

something, even though you could say something. “I' m going to bite my tongue when my sister-in-law comes over.” I'm not going to  say the things I want to say that might make her angry, or might make my wife an gry. That's more important.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
