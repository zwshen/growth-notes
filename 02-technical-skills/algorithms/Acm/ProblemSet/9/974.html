Shri Dattathreya Ramachandra Kaprekar was an Indian mathematician,
whose name is associated with a number of concepts in number theory.
He was born in Dahanu, near Mumbai, in India. Even as a small child, he was already
interested in numbers.

<p>Among his numerous contributions are the so called <i>Kaprekar numbers</i>.
These are non-negative integer numbers such that the representation of their square
can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again. For example,
55 is a <i>Kaprekar number</i>, because 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025, which can be split
into 30 and 25, and 30 + 25 = 55. There is one special rule: both
parts of this sum must be positive. This means that, for example, 10 is
not a <i>Kaprekar number</i>, even when 10^2 = 100 and 10+0=10 (but
the second part of the sum is zero - not positive).

 
<h2><font color=blue>The Problem</font></h2>

<p>
Given a range of numbers, your task is to discover and print all <i>Kaprekar
numbers</i> within that range.


<h2><font color=blue>Input</font></h2>

<p>
The first line of input contains a single number
<b>N</b>, representing the number of test cases that follow (<i>1 &le;
N &le; 1000</i>).

<p>
Than follow exactly <i>N</i> lines (one for each test case),
each one containing two
positive integers separated by a single space: <b>INF</b> and <b>SUP</b> (<i>2 &le; INF

&le; SUP &le 40000</i>),
indicating that the range to consider is the number interval <i>[INF,SUP]</i>
(this means that the limits are included in the interval to consider).

<h2><font color=blue>Output</font></h2>

<p>For each test case you should start by printing a line in the
format <tt><b>case #NUM</b></tt> where <i>NUM</i> is the test case
number (starting in one).


<p>Then, you must print all the <i>Kaprekar numbers</i> that appear in
the respective range, in ascending order, one per line. If there are no <i>Kaprekar
numbers</i> in the specified interval, you should print <tt><b>no
kaprekar numbers</b></tt>.

<p>There should also be a blank line between test cases.

<p>See the sample output for an example.
