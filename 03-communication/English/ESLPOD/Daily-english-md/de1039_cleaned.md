On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Mario and Leah about buying a new car. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Mario: I’d like to test drive the new Racer.  

Leah: Sure, all prospective buyers can take one of our cars for a test drive. May I see your driver’s license? 

Mario: Here it is.  

Leah: Okay, come with me. Why don’t you get into th e driver’s seat and I’ll get into the passenger seat? All right, please buckle u p and you can drive it around the block.  

Mario: I think I may need to drive it a little fart her to get a feel for the car.  

Leah: That’s fine, but you’ll need to slow down! 

Mario: Slow down? How will I know if this car is ri ght for my driving style if I don’t put the pedal to the metal and put it through its p aces? 

Leah: I understand you want to get a complete drivi ng experience, but unless you stop driving recklessly, we’ll need to return to th e car lot.  

Mario: You call this reckless? This isn’t reckless.  It’s how I always drive. If you don’t hear the tires screeching, you’re not driving  a car the way it should be driven. 

Leah: Well, an interesting way of looking at it. Uh , I think we’d better head back to the car lot. I’m feeling a little nauseous. 

Mario: Let me guess. You’ve never ridden in a car d riven by a racecar driver before. 

Leah: That’s right.  

Mario: Then this is your lucky day! 

[end of dialogue] 

Mario says to Leah, “I’d like to test drive the new  Racer.” The “Racer” is a name of a car, an imaginary car. Mario wants to test dri ve the car. “To test drive” is to drive a car that you’re thinking of buying, a car t hat someone is selling. You want to see if you like the car before you buy it, so yo u take it for a test drive – or, to use the verb, you “test drive the car.” The word “t est” in English in this case means to try something – to do something in prepara tion, often, for something else. We also use the word “test” when we are talki ng about giving someone an examination in school, for example.  

Leah says, “Sure, all prospective buyers can take o ne of our cars for a test drive.” Leah works for the place that sells these c ars. We call that place a “car lot” – or, if they sell new cars, we call it a “dea lership.” Leah says that “all prospective buyers can take one of our cars for a t est drive.” A “prospective (prospective) buyer” is a possible or potential buy er. We can talk about a “prospective student” – someone who isn’t a student  yet, but might be a student in the future. It’s possible.  

Leah then asks Mario, “May I see your driver’s lice nse?” Your “driver’s license” (license) is a small card given by, in the United S tates, the state government that gives you permission to drive a car. Here in the U. S. we don’t have a national driver’s license. Each state or territory issues, o r gives you, a driver’s license. Now normally, the driver’s license allows you to dr ive anywhere in the United States, even outside of your own state.  

However, if you move from one state to another, you  often have to take another driving test in order to get a driver’s license fro m a different state. The reason for  

that is that states have slightly different rules a bout driving, although most of the rules are the same. Mario says, “Here it is.” He’s giving Leah his driver’s license. Leah says, “Okay, come with me. Why don’t you get i nto the driver’s seat and I’ll get into the passenger seat.” The “seat” (seat) is where you sit in a car. The “driver’s seat” is, in an American car, on the left -hand side of the car. That’s where the driver sits, who controls the car.  

All the other seats in the car are called “passenge r seats.” A “passenger” (passenger) is any person who is riding in the car who is not the driver. You could also be a passenger on a train or a passenger  on a boat. You could be a passenger on an airplane. As long as you’re not the  one controlling the vehicle, you are a passenger. Although on an airplane, there  are other people on the airplane who are not controlling the airplane. We w ould not call them “passengers,” typically; they would be members of t he airline staff. But back to our story.  

Leah is telling Mario to “get into the driver’s sea t.” Notice we use that phrasal verb “to get into” for getting into a seat, for sit ting down in the seat. Leah says, “All right, please buckle up and you can drive it a round the block.” “To buckle (buckle) up” means to put your seatbelt on. A “seat  belt” is a strap, a piece of material, that holds your body into the seat of the  car in case there’s an accident.  

In the United States, I believe in every state – I could be wrong – there are laws that require you to wear a seatbelt, especially if you are in the front of the car. In California, you are required to wear a seatbelt in any of the seats in the car, the driver’s seat or a passenger seat. If you don’t wea r your seatbelt, you can get fined. You can get what we would call a “ticket” fr om the police. You’ll have to pay money and maybe even go to jail – although you probably won’t go to jail if you don’t buckle up, but you’ll definitely get a ti cket from the police.  

Leah tells Mario he can drive “around the block.” A  “block” (block) is a square or rectangular area that is surrounded by four streets . Mario says, “I think I may need to drive it a little farther to get a feel for  the car.” “Farther” (farther) means at a great distance, or involving a large distance. “F arther” is used for physical distances. Mario is saying that he may need to driv e the car more than just around the block in order to “get a feel for the ca r.” “To get a feel (feel) for” something means to become familiar with something, to understand what something is like.  

Mario is saying that he needs to drive the car for a longer period of time or for a longer distance in order to really see if he likes the car not. That’s what he means here. Leah says, “That’s fine, but you’ll need to s low down.” She’s telling Mario  

not to drive so fast. Mario says, “Slow down?” He’s  confused. “How will I know if this car is right for my driving style if I don’t p ut the pedal to the metal and put it through its paces?”  

Mario is asking how he can know if this is the righ t car for him, if this is the right car for his “driving style,” if he doesn’t “put the  pedal to the metal.” Your “driving style” is the way that you like to drive. Some peop le drive fast. Some people drive slow. Some people drive like idiots, such as here i n Los Angeles. The driving style of Mario is to go fast. That’s what he means by the expression “put the pedal (pedal) to the metal (metal).” “To put the pe dal to the metal” is an old expression meaning to drive a car really fast.  

The “pedal” is the thing that your foot steps on in  order to make the car go faster. The “metal” would be the car itself – the metal of the car, I suppose. “To put the pedal to the metal” means to drive really fast. Mar io wants to do this in order “to put the car through its paces” (paces). “To put som ething through its paces” means to use the machine or whatever it is that you r testing at the maximum capacity to determine the limits of what it can do.   

So, if you are putting a car through its paces, you  would want to drive the car very fast, or perhaps you would want to go around i n circles to see how well the car handles, how well it drives, going around in ci rcles. In general, to put something through its paces means to test it to see  how much it can do of whatever it is the thing is supposed to do. If I wa s going to put my computer through its paces, I might, for example run a bunch  of different programs at the same time and see how quickly or how slowly the pro grams operated.  

Leah is a little worried here. She says, “I underst and you want to get a complete driving experience, but unless you stop driving rec klessly, we’ll need to return to the car lot.” “To drive recklessly” (recklessly) me ans to drive without being careful – carelessly, dangerously. The “car lot” is the pla ce where the cars are kept, where they are parked. Mario says, “You call this r eckless?” “You call” is an expression we use to mean “Are you saying that this  is something?” Mario’s asking Leah if she considers the way he is driving to be reckless. Obviously, Mario doesn’t.  

In fact, he says, “This isn’t reckless. It’s how I always drive. If you don’t hear the tires screeching, you’re not driving a car the way it should be driven.” “Tires” (tires) are the pieces of rubber that go around the  wheel on the car. The verb “to screech” (screech) means to make a very loud, high pitched sound. This would be an example of a tire screeching. Mario says if y ou don’t hear the tires  

screeching, you’re not driving a car correctly. Of course, most people would say just the opposite – that you driving the car too fa st.  

Leah says, “Well, an interesting way of looking at it.” She’s trying to be polite because, of course, Mario is a prospective buyer of  this car. She doesn’t want to make him angry, but she also doesn’t want to die. S he says, “Uh, I think we’d better head back,” meaning return, “to the car lot.  I’m feeling a little nauseous.” If you feel “nauseous” (nauseous), you feel as though you might vomit, or throw up. Your stomach is not right and you feel sick.  

Mario says, “Let me guess. You’ve never ridden in a  car driven by a race car driver before?” A “race car driver” is someone who drives cars very quickly in a competition such as the Indianapolis 500 or other c ar competitions where people drive cars very fast. Leah says, “That’s right.” Ma rio says, “Then this is your lucky day.” Mario thinks it’s a good thing for Leah to be  driving with him, and Leah does not agree.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Mario: I’d like to test drive the new Racer.  

Leah: Sure, all prospective buyers can take one of our cars for a test drive. May I see your driver’s license?
