This episode is a dialogue between Elizabeth and Si dney about breaking your arm or your leg – sounds painful. Let’s get started .

[start of dialogue]

Elizabeth: We need to get you to the hospital right  now!

Sidney: I took a tumble, that’s all. It’s nothing –  just a little pain in my elbow and leg.

Elizabeth: Your arm is twisted in an odd angle and you’re limping. You could have broken bones.

Sidney: In the past, I’ve had a compound fracture i n my ankle and a stress fracture in my wrist, and they both hurt a lot more  than this. I’m sure it’s nothing serious.

Elizabeth: Look how your arm is swelling up. It alm ost looks deformed. And you still can’t put weight on your leg.

Sidney: The last thing I need right now is to get a  splint or a cast. I have to get to work.

Elizabeth: You can’t work in the shape you’re in. W hy don’t you let me take you to the emergency room to get treated?

Sidney: I’ll just take a couple of painkillers and walk it off.

Elizabeth: You mean limp it off. Well, in the end, it’s your arm, it’s your leg, and it’s your funeral!

Elizabeth begins our dialogue by shouting or yellin g, “We need to get you to the hospital right now!” Sidney says, however, “I took a tumble, that’s all.” Elizabeth thinks that Sidney needs to go to the hospital imme diately but Sidney doesn’t agree. He says he “just took a tumble” (tumble). “T o take a tumble” is another way of saying “to fall down” – to go from standing to being on the ground accidentally.

Sidney says, “It’s nothing – just a little pain in my elbow and leg.” Your “elbow” (elbow) is that part of your arm that connects the top part of your arm to the bottom part of your arm – your “upper arm,” we woul d call it – to your lower arm. Elizabeth says, “Your arm is twisted in an odd angl e and you’re limping.” “To be twisted” (twisted) means to have two parts of somet hing turned in opposite directions. In this case, I suppose it would mean t hat one part of your arm is not in the direction it should be. It’s twisted.

Elizabeth says the arm is “twisted in an odd,” or u nusual or strange, “angle” (angle). An “angle” is technically the number of de grees between two straight lines. So, the corner of a room is a, usually, 90-d egree angle. There are 360 degrees in a circle. If you have a square room or a  rectangular room, the corners of the room have 90-degree angles. Elizabeth says t he arm “is twisted in an odd angle” – an angle it should not be at. “And,” she s ays, “you’re limping.” “To limp” (limp) means to walk in an uneven way so that you a re putting more of your weight on one leg versus the other.

Elizabeth says, “You could have broken bones” (bone s). Your “bones,” of course, are those hard substances in your body that support  your body. All the bones in your body make up what’s called your “skeleton” (sk eleton). You have bones in your arms. You have bones in your legs. You have bo nes in your ears, even. Sidney says, “In the past, I’ve had a compound frac ture in my ankle and a stress fracture in my wrist, and they both hurt a lot more  than this. I’m sure it’s nothing serious.”

Sidney is saying that he has broken his bones befor e, and when that happened, it caused a lot more pain than what he is experienc ing right now, and therefore he thinks he has not broken any bones. He mentions a “compound (compound) fracture (fracture).” A “fracture” is when there is  a break in the bone – when the bone is broken. A “compound fracture” is when the b one is broken into one or

more pieces and often the bone comes out through the skin. I know, it sounds pretty awful, doesn’t it? Well, it is.

Apparently Sidney had a compound fracture in his an kle. Your “ankle” (ankle) is that part of your foot that connects the foot to the lower leg. Sidney also had a “stress (stress) fracture” in his “wrist” (wrist). Your “wrist” connects your hand to your lower arm. A “stress fracture” is less serious  than a compound fracture. It’s basically a crack or a line in the bone that is oft en caused by using the bone in a certain way over time that causes it to form a smal l crack or line.

Elizabeth says, “Look how your arm is swelling up.”  “To swell” (swell) means to get bigger, to get larger. The verb, the phrasal ve rb, “to swell up” means for a part of your body to become very large, usually bec ause you have hurt it. Your body naturally tries to protect parts that have bee n hurt, and one consequence, one result of, say, breaking a bone may be that the  parts around the bone swell up.

Elizabeth says that his arm, Sidney’s arm, “looks d eformed.” “Deformed” (deformed) means not having a normal shape, especia lly when we’re talking about some part of the human body. Elizabeth says, “And you still can’t put weight on your leg.” “To put weight (weight) on you r leg” means to walk or stand as you would normally, so that part of the weight of your body is being supported by your leg or legs.

Sidney says, “The last thing I need right now,” mea ning something that I definitely do not want, “is to get a splint or a ca st.” When you hurt your arm, especially if you break your arm or your leg, you m ay get a “splint” (splint). A splint is usually made with one or two hard objects  that cannot bend that are placed next to or around a broken bone so that you don’t or can’t move your arm and leg and damage or hurt your arm or leg even mor e.

A “cast” (cast) has a similar function or purpose. A “cast” is when the doctor puts an object that surrounds your arm or your leg – usu ally it’s made nowadays of a special material called “fiberglass,” though it use d to be made more commonly with something called “plaster” (plaster). If you b reak an arm or a leg, you will often have the arm or leg put in a cast so you don’ t move it, to give your body time to “heal” (heal). “To heal” means to get bette r, to recover. Sidney doesn’t want a splint or a cast because he has to get to wo rk.

Elizabeth says, “You can’t work in the shape you’re  in.” “Shape” (shape) here refers not to the form or look of something, but ra ther to the health or physical condition of the body. Elizabeth says, “Why don’t y ou let me take you to the

emergency room to get treated?” The “emergency room ” is a special place in a hospital where you go when there is something wrong  with you that needs to be taken care of immediately. So, if you fall down and  break your leg, the first place you will go to is the emergency room of a hospital so that the doctors can help you.

An “emergency room” is sometimes called by its init ials: the “ER.” “To get treated” (treated) means to get help from a doctor or a nurse. Sidney says, “I’ll just take a couple of painkillers and walk it off.”  Sidney doesn’t want to go to the hospital. He just wants to “take,” or swallow, “a c ouple of painkillers.” “Painkillers” are pills usually that you take, that you swallow, that help you with the pain that you are experiencing. It’s a pretty logical name for the drug, “painkiller.” It kills, or stops, the pain.

Sidney says he just wants “to walk it off.” “To wal k it off” means to use your legs even though they are in pain. We use this expressio n when you hurt your legs in some way but it isn’t serious. Athletes, for exampl e, will sometimes hurt their legs during a game but they don’t stop and go to a hospi tal. They just walk around a little until it feels better, until the pain dies d own or goes away. Elizabeth then says to Sidney, “You mean limp it off,” meaning he isn’t just going to walk it off – he’s going to have to limp because his leg is hurt so badly.

“Well,” she says, “in the end” – meaning if we exam ine the situation and try to come to a conclusion – “it’s your arm, it’s your le g, and it’s your funeral.” The expression “It’s your funeral” (funeral) is used to  tell someone that he or she is responsible for the bad things that will happen bec ause of his or her bad decisions. A “funeral” is a ceremony, an event you have when someone dies.

Elizabeth is making a joke here. That expression – “It’s your funeral” – is said somewhat jokingly to someone who we think is making  a bad decision. We’re saying well, you’re making this bad decision, but y ou are the one who is going to suffer the consequences. You are the one who will b e hurt by your bad decision, including perhaps even dying. That’s why Elizabeth says, “It’s your arm, it’s your leg, and it’s your funeral.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Elizabeth: Your arm is twisted in an odd angle and you’re limping. You could have broken bones.
