This episode is a dialogue between Lauren and Yves about making or producing things automatically, with machines. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Lauren: Wow, that was an impressive demonstration o f how robots can be used in production. I think that we need robots like tho se to automate some of the functions in our factories.

Yves: I admit the demonstration was eye-opening, bu t I don’t think the technology is there yet to allow us to replace peop le with robots.

Lauren: No, not for many of the functions, but we c ould have them do some of the more routine and hazardous tasks.

Yves: You mean have them work alongside our current  workers? I’m not sure how our workers would take it. Wouldn’t the robots get in the way?

Lauren: Not with their sophisticated sensors, which  allow them to avoid other people or machines.

Yves: I don’t know. Introducing automation would be  tricky.

Lauren: What’s important is that they’ll increase p roduction and reduce accidents. The demonstration showed how easy it is to program one of those robots, even when fine calibration is required.

Yves: I’m thinking of the people in the factories. Wouldn’t we have a riot on our hands if we tried to replace people with robots?

Lauren: It’s the wave of the future.

Yves: So you wouldn’t object to a robot replacing y ou?

Lauren: Me? They’ll never replace me with a robot. I’m indispensable.

Yves: Just like the typewriter?

Our dialogue begins with Lauren saying, “Wow, that was an impressive demonstration of how robots can be used in producti on.” If something is “impressive,” it’s something that we think is very good. It makes an impression on us. It makes us remember it. A “robot” (robot) is a  machine that performs some action, often an action that a human being would do . Robots are often associated with, oh, I don’t know, characters such as R2D2 in Star Wars. That might be considered a robot. The word “production” means man ufacturing – the process of making, building, or creating something.

Lauren says, “I think that we need robots like thos e to automate some of the functions in our factories.” The verb “to automate”  (automate) means to do something that doesn’t require your involvement or the involvement of a human being. We have another very common term, “automatic ally” – an adverb meaning that something is done by a machine or by a compute r that doesn’t require anyone to go and do anything. It just happens. “To automate” is the verb from which we get the adverb “automatically” or the adje ctive “automatic.”

Lauren thinks that her company should get some of t hese robots to automate some of the functions, some of the things that are done in their factories. A “factory” (factory) is a place where things are bui lt – physical things typically like cars or, I don’t know, computers, bookshelves. Actu ally, I did my own bookshelves. I ordered a set of bookshelves from a company, and they send you the wood, right? And then you have to paint the woo d yourself and then put them together. And they look really nice, I think. They’ re in my office. You should come and see them someday.

Anyway, a factory is a place where things are made and then sold to people already put together. (Real men put their own books helves together, you see.) Yves, who is a man – there’s also an English name E ve (Eve), which is a

woman’s name, but here it’s a man’s name because it ’s (Yves) – Yves says, “I admit the demonstration was eye-opening.” When we s ay something is “eye (eye) – opening,” we mean that it provides you info rmation, sometimes surprising information, that you didn’t know before – informat ion that makes you realize the importance of something. It could be something good  or something bad.

Yves says this demonstration, whatever they saw, wa s “eye-opening,” but he doesn’t think “the technology is there yet to allow  us to replace people with robots.” If we say something “isn’t there (there) y et,” we mean it isn’t advanced enough or it hasn’t developed enough to be useful. In this case, it’s not developed enough to allow Yves and Lauren to replac e people with robots, to have robots doing the jobs of humans. Lauren says, “No, not for many of the functions, but we could have them do some of the mo re routine and hazardous tasks.”

Something that is “routine” (routine) is something that happens in the same way over and over again, typically without changing. We  might use also the adjective “repetitive.” “Repetitive” comes from the verb “to repeat” (repeat), which means to do something again – a second, third, fourth, and f ifth time and so forth. “Hazardous” (hazardous) comes from the word “hazard ,” which means danger.

So, something that is hazardous is something that i s dangerous, that could hurt you or perhaps even kill you. We use this word “haz ardous” sometimes with chemicals – liquid or other substances that might b e dangerous. Hazardous chemicals would be chemicals that could hurt you or  even kill you. Here, we’re talking about hazardous tasks – things that you do.  Yves says, “You mean have them work alongside our current workers?” “Alongsid e” (alongside) means next to.

Yves is asking Lauren if she thinks the company sho uld have the robots working next to or alongside the workers, the human workers  they have now. He says, “I’m not sure how our workers would take it.” Here,  the expression “take it” means how they would accept it, how they would reac t to it. He asks, “Wouldn’t the robots get in the way?” If something “gets in t he way,” it prevents you from doing something you would otherwise do. It’s what w e would call an “obstacle” (obstacle).

An “obstacle” is something that gets in your way, t hat prevents you from doing what you want to do. It’s some difficulty you have to overcome, perhaps. Lauren says, “Not with their sophisticated sensors which a llow them,” meaning the robots, “to avoid other people or machines.” A “sen sor” (sensor) is a machine

that is able to measure something. It might be temp erature. It might be distance. It might be some other physical characteristic that  is important.

Usually sensors are put on things so that some othe r action happens when a certain thing is detected. So, you might have a tem perature sensor for example in, I don’t know, your oven, where you cook things,  and when it reaches a certain temperature, the oven may turn off. That’s one poss ible use of a sensor. Lauren says the robots have sensors that will detect wheth er they are close to other people or other machines and therefore not get in t he way.

Yves says, “I don’t know. Introducing automation wo uld be tricky.” Something that’s “tricky” (tricky) is something that’s diffic ult, something that would require very careful planning or very careful implementatio n. When you actually have to do it, you have to be careful how it’s done. Lauren  says, “What’s important is that they’ll” – meaning the robots – “they’ll increase p roduction and reduce or lower the number of accidents. The demonstration showed h ow easy it is to program one of those robots, even when fine calibration is required.”

“To program” (program) something means to give it i nstructions – specifically, to give a computer or a machine instructions. We all k now about “computer programming,” which of course is necessary for the machines that we call “computers” to operate. More recently, people have started using the word “coding” (coding) to refer to computer programming because the language, if you will, that computer programming is written in is ca lled “code” (code). Lauren says that these robots can be programmed even when fine calibration is required.

“Calibration” (calibration) is the process of makin g sure that a machine is accurate in what it is doing. For example, if you a re going to weigh something, if you want to see how much something weighs, you use something in English called a “scale” (scale). But the scale has to be c alibrated. You have to make sure that the scale is giving you the correct numbe r, the correct amount. What Lauren is talking about is calibrating robots to ma ke sure that they’re accurate and do exactly what they’re supposed to do.

Yves says, “I’m thinking of the people in the facto ries. Wouldn’t we have a riot on our hands if we tried to replace people with robots ?” A “riot” (riot) is a violent protest. The expression “on our hands” means someth ing that is your responsibility and that you have to deal with. Usua lly it’s something negative that happens, something bad that happens, and you have t o deal with it. You have to take care of it. Usually because it’s your responsi bility. Yves is worried that if they put computers – or rather, robots – into the factor ies, they would have a riot on their hands. The workers would protest.

 Lauren says, however, “It’s the wave of the future. ” This expression, “the wave (wave) of the future,” means that it is something t hat will be very common in the near future – within a year or two, or perhaps with in ten years. “The wave of the future” is the way things are going. It’s something  that will be common in the future, even though it’s not very common right now.  Yves says, “So you wouldn’t object to a robot replacing you?” “To object (objec t) to” something is a phrasal verb meaning to disagree with someone or something,  to say something is a bad idea.

Yves is asking Lauren if a robot could replace her,  if she would think that’s a bad idea, the way she is proposing to replace workers w ith robots. Lauren says, “Me? They’ll never replace me with a robot. I’m indispen sable.” Something that is “indispensable” (indispensable) is something that i s necessary, something that is required. The opposite would be “dispensable.” If s omething is dispensable, you don’t need it. You can get rid of it. If it’s indis pensable, it is not dispensable; you must have it. Lauren thinks she’s indispensable.

Yves then gives her a comparison, “Just like the ty pewriter?” A “typewriter,” for those young ones out there who don’t know, is a mac hine that we used to use back before computers and are still used in some pl aces, of course, that you don’t need to plug in. Well, I guess you can plug i n electric typewriters, but basically they’re machines used for putting ink mar ks on paper. Instead of having a printer, we had things called a “typewriter.”

I’m joking, of course. Most of you probably remembe r typewriters, but typewriters are no longer used as much as they used to be, and that’s the joke that Yves is making here. Lauren think she’s indispensable, but people thought typewriters would be indispensable, and now they are in fact, f or the most part, dispensable. Although I actually have an old typewriter sitting on my desk, so someday when we don’t have any power here in Los Angeles, I’ll s till be able to type on my typewriter.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Our scriptwriter is indispensable. We couldn’t live  without her. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse. Will a robot someday  be able to do her job? I don’t think so. She’s just that good.
