<P>
Write a program that will compare two texts. The two texts are assumed do be
different versions of the same text. Three different things can happen to a text between two versions:
<P>
<UL><LI> Text could be deleted<LI> Text could be inserted<LI> Text could be changed
</UL>
<P>
Any combination of the three can occur at once. A move, for example will look as a deletion at one place and an insert at another. You should
list all changes that happened from the old to the new version.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The input file contains several datasets, each containing two lines with <TT>text1</TT> and <TT>text2</TT> strings.
They contain the two versions of
the text to compare. String <TT>text2</TT> should be regarded as the older version, and string <TT>text1</TT> as the newer.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The outputfile contain all deletions, insertions
and changes that happended to the text between the two versions
in the following format:
<P>
<UL><LI> deletion: Position of the first character deleted,
the word ``<TT>deleted</TT>'' and the number
of characters deleted and the text that has been deleted.<LI> insertion: Position of the first character of the text inserted,
the word ``<TT>inserted</TT>''
since the last version, the number of characters inserted an the text inserted.<LI> change: Position of the first character changed,
the word ``<TT>changed</TT>'', the number of
characters changed, the original text and what it has been changed to.
</UL>
<P>
The position of the first character always refers to the position in
the <I>older</I> version (i.e.
the position within <TT>text2</TT>). The first character in a file
is numbered zero (0). The
program should <I>not</I> be case-sensitive. Print a blank line after each dataset.
