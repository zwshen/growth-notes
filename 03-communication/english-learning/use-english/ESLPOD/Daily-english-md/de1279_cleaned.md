This episode is a dialogue about making food for pe ople who can’t eat certain things, who have what we would call “dietary restri ctions.” Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Gemma: I think we should have a bake sale. We’ll ra ise lots of money for our school. 

Sebastian: A bake sale sounds good, but it’s too mu ch trouble. 

Gemma: How much trouble can it be to bake a few coo kies and cakes? 

Sebastian: It’s not as simple as that. We have to b e careful selling baked goods to people with dietary restrictions. 

Gemma: Like what? 

Sebastian: Some people have ethical concerns. Vegan s, for example, don’t want any animal products in their food. 

Gemma: Like eggs and milk? 

Sebastian: That’s right. And other people have medi cal problems or conditions. Diabetics, for instance, want their baked goods mad e with sugar substitutes, and people who are lactose intolerant want dairy substi tutes. 

Gemma: No sugar? No dairy? 

Sebastian: And there is a whole slew of allergies t o consider, like people who have celiac disease, those who can’t eat gluten, an d those who are allergic to wheat or peanuts.  

 Gemma: Wow, when did life get so complicated? How a bout a rummage sale instead? 

Sebastian: Good idea. 

[end of dialogue] 

Gemma begins our dialogue by saying to Sebastian, “ I think we should have a bake sale.” A “bake (bake) sale (sale)” is when peo ple get together and bake individual cakes and other things that they then br ing and sell, well, in order to raise money or get money for an organization such a s a school or a church. A lot of schools and churches have bake sales where indiv idual members of that organization each make something at home and then b ring it to the school or the church and sell it to people in order to get money for that organization. 

Gemma says, “We’ll raise,” meaning we’ll get, “lots  of money for our school.” Sebastian says, “A bake sale sounds good, but it’s too much trouble,” meaning it’s too difficult. It will cause too many problems . Gemma says, “How much trouble can it be to bake a few cookies and cakes?”  A “cookie” (cookie) is a small, usually round, flat dessert that is typicall y made with some kind of dough – flour and water combined together and then cooked, with other things of course. Cookies are sometimes hard, sometimes soft, but usu ally small enough that you can pick it up and eat it with your hand.  

A “cake” (cake) is a larger dessert, or thing that you would eat after a meal as something sweet, that is usually cut up into smalle r pieces so you can eat it. A cake is usually eight or 10 inches around, or it co uld be a big square cake like you would have at someone’s birthday party. Cake of ten has what is called “frosting” (frosting) on top of it. Frosting is a s weet, colored usually, layer of some sort of butter cream or other sweet spread that goe s on top of the cake.  

Sebastian says, “It’s not as simple as that.” Gemma  thinks it won’t be difficult to have this bake sale. Sebastian disagrees. He says, “We have to be careful selling baked goods to people with dietary restrict ions.” “Baked (baked) goods (goods)” refers to any kind of sweet food that is b aked in an “oven” (oven). An oven is where you put food to cook it, to make it w arm. An oven is basically a warm box that is heated.  

“Dietary” (dietary) refers to food – the things you  eat. A “restriction” is something that you cannot do, a limitation on what you can, i n this case, eat. So, “dietary restrictions” would be things that for whatever rea son, often a medical reason,  

you cannot eat. I, for example, cannot eat “shellfi sh” – things such as shrimp and crab, because I have an allergy. If I eat it, my bo dy reacts in a bad way. That’s a dietary restriction I have, which is too bad becaus e I really love shrimp and crab, but a few years ago I started having a reaction to that food, I’m not sure why, and now that’s one of my dietary restrictions.  

Gemma asks what sort of dietary restrictions they w ould have to worry about for their bake sale. Sebastian then begins by saying, “ Some people have ethical concerns.” “Ethical” (ethical) refers to what you t hink is right or wrong, what you believe is morally correct. Sebastian is talking ab out dietary restrictions not for someone’s health, but because of what someone might  believe, their ethics.  

He says, “Vegans,” for example, don’t want any anim al product in their food.” A “vegan” (vegan) is a person who does not eat or use  any animal products. No meat. No eggs. No milk. In many cases, no honey. Th at would be things that a vegan would not eat or not want to eat. It might no t be for an ethical concern, however, but for some vegans that’s probably true. Gemma then says, “Like eggs and milk?” Sebastian says, “That’s right.” Tho se are things a vegan would not eat.  

He continues, “And other people have medical proble ms or conditions. Diabetics, for instance, want their baked goods made with suga r substitutes, and people who are lactose intolerant want dairy substitutes.”  A “diabetic” (diabetic) is someone who has a disease called “diabetes,” which relates to the blood sugar and insulin in their body – chemicals in their body  that have to be regulated because of the disease.  

One of the things that diabetics usually avoid is s ugar, and therefore, they would want “sugar substitutes.” A “substitute” (substitut e) is when you replace one thing with another thing. I used to put sugar in my coffe e. Now I don’t. Now I use a “sugar substitute,” something that makes the coffee  sweet but isn’t sugar, although that might kill me also. I don’t know, but  I’m still going to drink my coffee.  

Diabetics want sugar substitutes. People who are “l actose (lactose) intolerant (intolerant)” want “dairy (dairy) substitutes.” “La ctose” is a kind of sugar that is found in milk. “Milk” is an example of a “dairy pro duct.” The word “dairy” means related to or made from milk. In the U.S., that’s u sually milk that comes from a cow. A “cow” is an animal that goes “Moo, moo.” You  know what I’m talking about, right? So, if you are “lactose intolerant,” you cannot have milk or dairy products because that bothers your stomach and give s you a bad reaction. There  

are lots of people who are lactose intolerant, who cannot drink a lot of milk or dairy because it makes them sick. 

Gemma then says, “No sugar? No dairy?” Sebastian co ntinues, “And there is a whole slew of allergies to consider.” A “slew” (sle w) of something is a large number of something. A “slew of allergies” (allergi es) would be many different allergies, or kinds of conditions that make someone  feel sick after they eat, touch, or smell something. An “allergy” is a condit ion in which your body reacts negatively to something that it is near or somethin g that you eat. I have an allergy to shellfish to shrimp. When I eat it, I start to l ook like a shrimp – my skin turns red.  

In addition to allergies, there are some people, pr obably a smaller number than is actually reported in the news, who have what is cal led “celiac disease.” “Celiac (Celiac) disease” is a medical condition which caus es people who eat certain kinds of wheat, barley, rye, or similar grains to e xperience negative effects such as pain in their stomach. People who have celiac di sease usually can’t eat anything that contains “gluten” (gluten). “Gluten” is a certain substance, what’s called a “protein” (protein), that is found in many  kinds of grain. It’s very difficult to make a lot of baked goods such as bread and cake wi thout having gluten in it. 

Sebastian also mentions people who are “allergic to  wheat (wheat) or peanuts (peanuts).” “Wheat” is a kind of plant that is ofte n used in a different form in baking and cooking. “Flour” (flour) is often made f rom wheat. You take the wheat and you grind it, or you make it into what is essen tially a powder, and that powder is mixed with water or some other liquid to make what is called “dough” (dough). You put that dough in the oven and it bake s, and you get wonderful bread and cake and other things.  

“Peanuts” is one kind of nut that is quite popular in the United States. I don’t like peanuts, myself, because I didn’t grow up eating pe anuts. Why? My older brothers are allergic to peanuts. They have an alle rgy to peanuts. When they eat peanuts, they have a negative reaction just like wh en I eat shrimp. I don’t really like peanuts. Many Americans love a product made fr om peanuts called “peanut butter,” but I have never had peanut butter because  I didn’t grow up eating peanuts and I don’t really like the taste. It’s alm ost un-American not to like peanut butter, but I do not.  

Anyway, back to our story. Gemma says, “Wow, when d id life get so complicated?” “When did things become so difficult? ” is what she’s saying. She then says, “How about a rummage sale, instead?” Ins tead of having a bake sale, Gemma suggests a “rummage (rummage) sale.” A rummag e sale is when people  

bring not baked goods from their houses, but things  they don’t want – chairs, electronics, dishes, books. They bring all of these  things to the church or the school and they sell those instead of cakes and coo kies. That’s a “rummage sale.”  

Sometimes people will call these a “garage sale” ev en though the sale isn’t done in a garage. In British English, they sometimes ref er to a “boot (boot) sale.” The “boot” is the back part of your car. The idea being  that you would go somewhere and put things in the back of your car and then ope n up the back of the car so people could see what you are selling and you could  sell it from there. The “boot” in the United States, on a car, is called the “trun k” (trunk).  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
