Hank begins by asking Svetlana, “What’s that for?” meaning “Why do you have that?” Svetlana says, “This costume?” A “costume” ( costume) refers to clothing that you wear so that you look like a different per son. People wear costumes, for example, on Halloween. They dress up or they put on  clothing to make them look like someone else. Little children may put on costu me to make them look like Superman or someone from Star Wars. I don’t know. I  don’t know what kids wear nowadays for costumes at Halloween.

Svetlana says that she’s planning a publicity stunt  “to get our stores more business.” “Publicity” (publicity) is attention tha t you get, especially from newspapers, magazines, radio stations, television s tations, and so forth. “Publicity” refers to attention you get from what w e would call the “media” (media), which refers to all the different ways peo ple get their information. Nowadays, that would include the Internet. A “stunt ” (stunt) is some action or some event that people do just to get attention. A “publicity stunt” is something a business or a person would do so that everybody els e pays attention to them. Usually, it involves fooling or tricking people int o believing something that isn’t true. That doesn’t always happen but that’s one kin d of publicity stunt.

Svetlana says she’s doing a publicity stunt “to get  our store more business.” “Business” here means more money, more people buyin g from us. Hank says, “You think that dressing up as a giant banana will get our store more business?” “To dress up as” means to wear a costume, to put on  special clothing. The verb “to dress up” usually means to put on nice clothes,  like you’re going to a nice dinner or a wedding, for example. “Dressing up as” means you’re putting on clothes like a costume, to pretend like you are a d ifferent person.

Svetlana says, “We need to get media coverage for t he grand opening of our store and attract as much attention as possible.” “ Media,” we’ve already talked about, refers to television, newspapers, and so for th. “Coverage” (coverage) means when these media sources – the newspapers, the magazines – write stories or have stories about you on their programs . If someone says, “There wasn’t a lot of coverage about the election this we ek,” they mean there weren’t very many stories in the newspapers or in the magaz ines or on television about that topic. “Coverage” refers to the amount that the news media is paying attention and talking about something.

 A “grand opening” is a big celebration, a big event  when a business opens up a new store or simply opens up their first store. Gra nd openings often have some sort of celebration attached to them or connected t o them. Sometimes you’ll have the mayor or the governor come to celebrate this op ening of a new business or of a new location for your business. Usually, the gove rnor doesn’t come to those sorts of things. Well, it’s possible.

Svetlana wants to get media coverage for the grand opening of their store and attract as much attention as possible. “To attract”  means to pull something toward yourself or, more generally, to cause someon e to become interested in you. That’s why we have the adjective “attractive.”  A woman who is attractive attracts men. Men become interested in her and walk  toward her and she, of course, turns around and walks in the other directi on. I guess that just happens to me.

“Attention” (attention) is a measure of how much pe ople are noticing someone or something. How much people are focused on a certain  thing or a certain person. “To attract attention,” then, is to get people to p ay attention, to look at you, to notice what you are doing.

Svetlana says that she’ll be on hand to give “sound  bites and organize photo ops.” The expression “to be on hand” means to be pr esent, to be there, to be available and ready in case someone wants, in this case, to talk to you. It’s an expression we would use mostly in business, talking  about someone who is going to be at a certain event.

A “sound bite” (bite) is a short phrase, sentence, or paragraph with some interesting information that is used, typically, in  a news story. You might have a politician who wants to get attention and he knows that typically, on television, you only have maybe 10 or 15 seconds. He will come up with some phrase, some expression that people will remember that will  summarize all of his ideas and arguments. That’s what a sound bite is. It’s a short quote, really, from someone about some situation in the news.

A “photo op” (op) is short for a “photo opportunity .” It’s a situation or an event that photographers like to come to or people from televi sion stations come to, to take pictures of something. Here in Hollywood, in Los An geles, every week there’s typically a new movie that is opening and they have  a celebration where they invite photographers, television stations to come a nd take pictures of the stars of the movie. This is a photo op – an opportunity for someone to have their photograph taken.

 Hank says, “How does a giant banana tie in to our s tore?” Remember Svetlana is going to dress up as a giant banana. Hank wants to know how this “ties into” their store. “To tie (tie) into something” means to relat e to, to be connected to something. Svetlana says, “It doesn’t.” It does not  tie into our store directly. “But trust me, it’ll get noticed.” People will notice us .

Hank says, “I was thinking of a traditional marketi ng campaign, more along the lines of holding a contest or a giveaway. And I don ’t see how a giant banana is going to get media attention.” A “marketing campaig n” is an effort to get people familiar with your product or your service. It’s a term we use in business to talk about making people aware that you exist. “Along the lines of” is an expression meaning related to or similar to. Hank was thinking  of a traditional marketing campaign, more along the lines of holding a contest  or a giveaway. He wants a marketing campaign that’s similar to something such  as holding, or having a contest or a giveaway. A “contest” is typically a c ompetition where people try to win something based either on luck or on something that they do. A “giveaway” (giveaway) – one word – is a noun referring to some thing that people are given for free, often by an organization that is trying t o market their product or service, to promote, to get people to pay attention to their  product or service.

Hank says, “I don’t see how a giant banana is going  to get media attention.” “Media attention” is the same as publicity. Svetlan a says, “The person in the giant banana costume will skydive into the parking lot of the store.” “To skydive” (skydive) means to jump out of an airplane and then  with, what we would call a “parachute,” to come down to the ground and land on  the ground – without dying, that’s the idea. The giant banana then, is going to  jump out of an airplane. It’s going to skydive into the parking lot of the store.  That’s how Svetlana will get people to pay attention to the giant banana.

Hank says, “What idiot have you convinced to do tha t?” He thinks this is a stupid idea and only a stupid person would agree to do it.  Svetlana says, “Well, that’s actually why I’m here.” What she’s saying is that s he wants Hank to be the person who dresses up in the giant banana and dives  out of the plane – skydives out of the plane.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a norm al speed.
