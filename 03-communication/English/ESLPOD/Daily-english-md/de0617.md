This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 617.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You probably know that, but d id you know that you can download a Learning Guide for this episode?  You d id?  Oh, all right!

Well, this episode is a dialogue between Tim and Jan ab out buying things that you would need in your bathroom.  We all need bathroo ms, and there are things you need to buy for them.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jan:  We’re almost done.  We just need to get some bat hroom supplies for Kimberly.

Tim:  Okay, here are some towels, a bathmat and a bath room scale.  Don’t forget the cleaning supplies.  She’ll need some rubber gloves, d isinfectant, bowl cleaner, and a plunger.

Jan:  All right.  We have all that.  Where are you go ing?

Tim:  She’ll need a soap dish and a toothbrush holder .  She’ll need a trashcan, too.

Jan:  Okay, I think we’re all done.  Kimberly is moving in to an apartment with college roommates, not starting her own bathroom suppl y store.  Let’s not go overboard.

Tim:  I just need to get a couple more things.

Jan:  What?

Tim:  I’m buying her 10 packages of toilet paper and 20  boxes of Kleenex.  She’ll be living on her own for the first time and she’ll nee d all that.

 Jan:  Ten packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Kleen ex?!  She can shop for herself, you know.  You don’t need to buy her a six-month  supply.

Tim:  Clearly you don’t know college students.  They’ll go  through that in a week!

Jan begins our dialogue by saying, “We’re almost done,” meaning we’re almost finished; we’ve almost completed our job – our task.  “We  just need to get some bathroom supplies for Kimberly.”  “Supply” (supply) is som ething that you need to do a particular activity or for a particular purpose.  So  if you are going to climb a mountain, you would probably need certain supplies such as food, water, clothing – I hope!

Well, these supplies that Jan and Tim are buying are for Kimberly’s bathroom. Kimberly is, I guess, their daughter.  Tim says, “Okay, he re are some towels, a bathmat and a bathroom scale.”  A “towel” is a large piece of fabric, something that absorbs water and you use it to dry yourself or to d ry something else.  Most towels are made of what we would call cloth; you could a lso have towels made of paper – paper towels, but for the bathroom you probab ly aren’t going to use paper towels.  A “bathmat” (bathmat – one word) is som ething you put on the ground in front of your shower or your bathtub, which i s where you wash yourself. The bathmat helps prevent the floor from getting wet from the water that would, of course, come off of you if you took a shower or a bat h.  A “bathroom scale” (scale) is something you put on the floor, you stand on it , and it tells you how much you weigh – that is, how many pounds or how many kilo s.  I personally like to weigh myself in kilos because it’s always a smaller number  than pounds!

Tim says, “Don’t forget the cleaning supplies,” the thing s you would need to clean a bathroom.  He says that Kimberly will need some rubber  gloves, disinfectant, bowl cleaner, and a plunger.  “Gloves” are things you pu t on your hands that cover your fingers and your hand.  “Rubber gloves” are gl oves made either from a plant or artificially, we would say synthetically.  Rubbe r is what you usually see on tires; tires are made of rubber – tires for your car.   Well, this is rubber gloves to keep your hands dry.  The other things that Tim thin ks they need to buy include disinfectant.  “Disinfectant” (disinfectant) is typi cally a liquid cleaning product, something that will kill bacteria – will kill things that might harm you.  To disinfect something is to remove the bacteria – the germs (germs) that might be on that surface, things that could make you sick.  A bowl cl eaner is also recommended by Tim.  The “bowl” here refers to the to ilet bowl, so a “bowl cleaner” is cleaner that will clean the inside of a toi let.  Finally, he recommends a

 plunger, which is not a cleaning supply.  A “plunger” (p lunger) is something that has a long, typically wooden stick, and at the end of the stick is a round piece of rubber, and you use this if you have a toilet that is no t flushing – that is, the water is not taking away what’s inside the toilet bowl.  You u se a plunger to create pressure to push what is preventing the water from leavi ng the toilet bowl out into the pipes, which take the water from the toilet bowl down into your city’s sewer system.  A “sewer” (sewer) is a system of pipes that take dirt y water away from your house.

So, that’s what a plunger is, and Tim thinks that Kimbe rly needs one.  Jan says, “All right.  We have all that.  Where are you going? ”  Tim says, “She’ll need a soap dish and a toothbrush holder.”  You can buy soap for  your bathroom that is a liquid.  You can also buy a solid form of soap, what w e would call a bar (bar) of soap, but you need a place to put the bar of soap so that it doesn’t slide around – it doesn’t move around.  That little container is calle d a “soap dish.”  “Dish” like you use for food, but this is one for soap.  A “toothbru sh” is what you use to clean your teeth; “tooth” is the singular of “teeth.”  A “t oothbrush holder” is a place to put your toothbrush.  Usually it’s something that has hole s in it that you can put a toothbrush in so that it will hold it – a toothbrush h older.  Tim also says that she’ll need a trashcan.  “Trash” (trash) is another word for g arbage, things that you are throwing away that you don’t want anymore.  A “trashca n” is where you put that garbage – those things.

Jan says, “Okay, I think we’re all done (we’re all finish ed).  Kimberly is moving into an apartment with college roommates,” people tha t she went to college with; her “roommates” are sharing the apartment.  “She’s no t starting her own bathroom supply store,” Jan says.  She’s joking; she thinks T im is buying too many things.  She says, “Let’s not go overboard.”  The e xpression “to go overboard” (overboard – one word) means to do too much of something, to go to an extreme about something, to do too much.

Tim says, “I just need to get a couple more things (I ju st need to get two or three, maybe four things).”  Jan says, “What?”  Tim says, “I’m buyin g her 10 packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Kleenex.”  “Toilet pap er” is soft paper that you use when you are going to the bathroom, when you are usin g the toilet – I think you know how that works!  “Kleenex” (Kleenex) is technically a t ype of what we would otherwise call tissues or facial tissues, but this particular  company’s product has become so popular that people just call facial tissues Klee nex even if it isn’t made by that company.  It’s what you use, for example, if you are going to blow your nose, or if you need to wipe your eyes after you’ve b een crying, then you would want to have some Kleenex.  Notice we typically say “b oxes of Kleenex.”

 We sometimes refer to the toilet paper as “rolls of toi let paper” because the paper is wrapped around in a circle.

Tim says that Kimberly will be living on her own for the  first time and she’ll need all that – all of those things.  “To live on your own” means to live outside of your family’s house, to live by yourself without any relatives.  I t can also mean without any roommates, although that isn’t what Tim means here .

Jan says, “Ten packages of toilet paper and 20 boxes of Klee nex?!  She can shop for herself, you know (she can buy things for herself) .”  She says, “You don’t need to buy her a six-month supply.”  That is, eno ugh toilet paper for six months.  Tim says, “Clearly you don’t know college students.   They’ll go through that in a week!”  So it seems that Kim is still in colleg e; I said before she was living with people she went – past tense – to college with.  But I guess she’s still in college because Tim says that Jan doesn’t know college stud ents.  She doesn’t have experience – information about them.  Tim says, “They’ll go through that in a week!”  “To go through (something)” is a two -word phrasal verb meaning to use all of something so that there is nothing left.   If you work in an office and you have to print out a lot of letters and reports, you will go through a lot of paper – you will use up a lot of paper.  “Go through” has som e other meanings in English, and those can be found in the Learning Guide .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

We try to make sure our scripts don’t go overboard with to o much vocabulary, and that’s thanks to our wonderful scriptwriter Dr. Lucy T se.
