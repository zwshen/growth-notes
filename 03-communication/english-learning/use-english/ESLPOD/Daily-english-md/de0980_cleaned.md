This episode is a dialogue between Wanda and George  about living in another country after you retire. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Wanda: I just heard the news. You’re moving to McQu illanland? 

George: I am. I’ve decided to retire abroad. 

Wanda: Why? 

George: It makes a lot of sense for people with a f ixed income. Social Security will only go so far here, but the cost of living is  much lower in other countries, including McQuillanland. I can live it up at a frac tion of the cost of living modestly here. 

Wanda: But you’re moving away from all of your frie nds and family. 

George: I can stay in touch remotely, and there is an American expat community there so I can make new friends. I am a little worr ied about learning the language and adjusting to life abroad, but I’ll be living a simpler life there and there’ll be less stress. 

Wanda: But sometimes things aren’t so reliable when  you live abroad. 

George: Like what? 

Wanda: I’ve heard that the Internet services can be  unreliable and power outages are common in McQuillanland. Are you sure y ou want to put down stakes in a foreign country? 

George: What do I have to lose? I already have my r esidency visa and a condo on the beach waiting for me. The real question is: when are you going to take the plunge?

Our dialogue begins with Wanda saying to George, “I  just heard the news” – I just received this information. “You’re moving to M cQuillanland?” George says, “I am. I’ve decided to retire abroad.” “To retire” (re tire) is to stop working, usually later in your life when you already have enough mon ey and you no longer have to work anymore. “Abroad” (abroad) is a term we use  to describe other countries – another country, not your own country. If you tra vel abroad, you go to different countries when you travel. If you retire abroad, yo u go to live in a different country after you’ve finished your work.  

Wanda says, “Why?” George says, “It makes a lot of sense for people with a fixed income.” “It makes a lot of sense” (sense) me ans it is logical. It is something that seems reasonable. “Fixed income” describes a s ituation where you only receive a certain amount of money each month, usual ly because you have retired and are not getting money from a job.  

You are instead getting money perhaps from what we would call a “pension” (pension), where a company or the government gives you money every month when you retire, or you have invested money – you h ave put your money in things like stocks and bonds and other ways of earn ing money with your money – and are taking money each month from that money you  have invested. That’s a “fixed income.” “Fixed” (fixed) means you don’t cha nge it. Once it’s established, once it is determined, it doesn’t change.  

“Social Security,” George says, “will only go so fa r here, but the cost of living is much lower in other countries, including McQuillanl and.” “Social Security” is the name of the U.S. government program that gives mone y to people who are old, who have worked their entire life, and now need mon ey to live on. Social Security also gives money to people who are disabled – that is, they don’t have the full use of their body for some reason, perhaps they hav e a disease or an illness, and they need help because they can’t work.  

Normally, Social Security refers to people who have  worked and have given the government money throughout their life, and now get  that money or some of that money back from the government. Often it’s more mon ey than they gave to the government. That’s one of the problems with our Soc ial Security system. But, this dialogue is simply saying that the money that a ret ired person gets from this government program called Social Security will only  go so far. That expression, “to only go so far,” means that it is limited. Real ly, it means it’s not enough. It’s less than what you really need.  

George says, “The cost of living is much lower in o ther countries.” The “cost of living” refers to the amount of money you need to s pend each month in order to live. That would include your rent for your apartme nt, your food, your transportation, your health insurance, your movies,  your Coca-Cola – all of these things could be part of your cost of living. George  says, “The cost of living is much lower” – is less – “in other countries.” This is something that a lot of American retirees realize, and for that reason they  decide to move to another country where it doesn’t cost as much money to live .  

The majority of people, of course, don’t move to an other country after they retire, but there are some people who decide that this is a  good option for them. George says, “I can live it up at a fraction of the cost o f living modestly here.” The expression “to live it up” means to live in a very enjoyable and fun way by spending usually lots of money. If you want to go o ut every night, and have a drink at a bar, and see a movie, and eat at a very nice restaurant, you would need to spend a lot of money, in a city like Los An geles, to be able to do that.  

But if you move to another country where things are  cheaper, where the cost of living is lower, you can still have a good time. Yo u can live it up, but not have to pay very much money to do it. The expression “at a fraction (fraction) of the cost” means at a much lower price, much more cheaply. A “ fraction” is something like one-half or one-third or one-fifth. It is less than  one. So, if it’s at a fraction of the cost, it is at a much lower cost to you.  

George says he “can live it up at a fraction of the  cost of living modestly here.” So, he’s telling you what cost he’s comparing this to. He’s comparing it to the cost of living it up here in the United States. He says that even living modestly here is more expensive than living it up in another  country. “Modestly” (modestly) here means without very much or not very much. “To live modestly” or “to spend modestly” is to use enough money so that you can li ve, but not live well. You don’t have a nice new car or a beautiful house. You  may live in a small apartment with a small car or no car at all. That would be li ving modestly.  

Wanda says, “But you’re moving away from all of you r friends and family.” George says, “I can stay in touch” – I can stay in contact with, I can communicate with these people – “remotely, and there is an Amer ican expat community there so I can make new friends.” “Remotely” (remotely) m eans from a faraway place, from a long distance away. We talk about people wor king “remotely.” That usually means that instead of going to an office bu ilding where the company’s headquarters are, they work at their home or in ano ther city.  

George says that in McQuillanland, “there is an Ame rican expat community.” “Expat” (expat) is a short form of the word “expatr iate.” An “expatriate” is a person who lives in another country, often for a lo ng time while working in that country. The person isn’t a visitor. They are livin g in the country, sometimes to work, but sometimes as what we would call a “retire e” (retiree), which is a person who has retired.  

George says, “I am a little worried about learning the language and adjusting to life abroad, but I’ll be living a simpler life and there there’ll be less stress.” “To adjust to something” is to get used to something, t o adapt to something, we might say. George is worried about learning the language of McQuillanland and adjusting to life in another country, but he says h e’ll be living a simpler life – a less complicated, less stressful life –in McQuillan land.  

Wanda says, “But sometimes things aren’t so reliabl e when you live abroad.” “To be reliable” means you can depend on them. You can count on them. George says, “Like what?” Wanda says, “I’ve heard that the  Internet services can be unreliable and power outages are common in McQuilla nland.” A “power outage” (outage) is a period of time when you don’t have el ectricity. In some countries, it may happen that the electricity is only on during c ertain hours of the day. That would be what Wanda is talking about here.  

She says, “Are you sure you want to put down stakes  in a foreign country?” The expression “to put down stakes” (stakes) means to s elect a new place to live, to select a location where you are going to live. When  I left Minnesota, I put down stakes in Los Angeles. This is where I decided I wa s going to live. George says, “What do I have to lose?” This is a common expressi on meaning there is no bad thing that can happen to me – there’s no negative c onsequence of doing this.  

George says, “I already have my residency visa and a condo on the beach waiting for me.” “Residency” (residency) refers to living permanently in a certain place. A “visa” (visa) here means permission to ent er a country and to stay in that country. So, a “residency visa” refers to official permission from the country for you to go and live there. Not all countries, of cou rse, will allow you to come and  

just live in their country for the rest of your lif e. But McQuillanland is different. They’ll take anyone who wants to go.  

George says he has his “residency visa and a condo on the beach.” A “condo” is a condominium. It’s a kind of apartment that you ow n instead of rent. Although, you can buy a condominium and then rent it to anoth er person, of course. George says, “The real question is” – the most impo rtant question is – “when are you going to take the plunge?” “To take the plunge”  (plunge) is to start something that is difficult or challenging, especially if you  are unsure about it or nervous about it.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
