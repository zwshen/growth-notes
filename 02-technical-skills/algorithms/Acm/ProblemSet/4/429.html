<P>
A common word puzzle found in many newspapers and magazines is the <EM>word
transformation.</EM>  By taking a starting word and successively altering a single
letter to make a new word, one can build a sequence of words which changes the
original word to a given end word.  For instance, the word ``<TT>spice</TT>'' can be transformed in four steps to the word ``<TT>stock</TT>'' according to the following
sequence:   <TT>spice, slice, slick, stick, stock.</TT>  Each successive
word differs from the previous word in only a single character position while
the word length remains the same.
<P>
<P>
Given a dictionary of words from which to make transformations, plus a list of
starting and ending words, your team is to write a program to determine the
number of steps in the shortest possible transformation.

<P>
The first line of the input is an integer N, indicating the number of test set
that your correct program should test followed by a blank line. Each test set will have two sections.  The first section will be
the dictionary of available words with one word per line, terminated by a line
containing an asterisk (<TT>*</TT>) rather than a word. There can be up to 200 words in the dictionary; all words will be alphabetic and in lower case, and no word will be longer than ten characters.  Words can appear in the dictionary in any order.
<P>
Following the dictionary are pairs of words, one pair per line, with the words
in the pair separated by a single space.  These pairs represent the starting
and ending words in a transformation. All pairs are guaranteed to have a transformation using the
dictionary given.  The starting and ending words will appear in the
dictionary.
<P>
Two consecutive input set will separated by a blank line.
<P>
The output should contain one line per word pair for each test set, and must include the
starting word, the ending word, and the number of steps in the shortest
possible transformation, separated by single spaces. Two consecutive output set
will be separated by a blank line.
