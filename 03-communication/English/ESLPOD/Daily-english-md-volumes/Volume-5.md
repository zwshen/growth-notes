Brett:  It is, isn’t it?  I know you were a little worried about me moving out and into a house with five roommates.  But as you can see, this is a nice place.  Let me give you a tour.  Mom:  Oh, okay.  Isn’t it a little cramped in the house with six people?  Brett:  No way!  Come on.  I’ll show you the rest of the house.  Let’s go this way to the kitchen.  Watch out for that hole in the floor.  I don’t want you to trip.  And don’t worry about the “Do Not Cross – Police Line” tape.  It’s just a joke.  Mom:  This is the kitchen?  Why are all of your dishes on the floor?  What do you keep in your cupboards?  Brett:  Be careful opening them!  We’re short on closet space so some of the guys keep their clothes and shoes in them.

The topic for this episode is buying things for your childr en that they will need for school.  We’ll go over some common vocabulary for things th at you would use in school.  We’ll listen to a dialogue between Svetlana a nd Quinn.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Svetlana:  Tomorrow is the first day of junior high.  Are you ready?

Quinn:  Sure, it’s not that big a deal.  I already p ut some supplies in my new backpack.

Svetlana:  Let’s see.  You have some folders, a three-rin g binder, and a pen.  Is that all you’re bringing to school?

Quinn:  I don’t have my books yet.  I’ll get those tomor row morning.  What else do I need?  I’m not in the second grade.  I don’t nee d things like glue, crayons, and construction paper.

Svetlana:  No, but you’re missing a lot of stuff.  I shou ld know.  You have a pen, but no pencils.  You have no erasers or highlighters.  You have a three-ring binder, but you don’t have any ruled paper or a noteb ook.

Quinn:  I don’t need all of that stuff on the first d ay!

Svetlana:  You want to be prepared, don’t you?  Where  are your index cards? Don’t you have a calculator?  You’ll need it for your ma th class.

Quinn:  Are you kidding me?!  If I carry all of that pl us my books, who will carry me to class?

 [end of dialogue]

Let me begin by explaining a little bit about the tit le for this episode, “Buying Back-to-School Supplies.”  We could just say, “Buying School Supplies.”  We say here “Back-to-School” to emphasize that these are child ren who went to school last year and are going to school again this year; they are what we might call “continuing students.”  Each August, all of the stores hav e Back-to-School sales, things that they are selling parents and students, things that they will need for school – new clothing for example, new school supplies, et c.

Our dialogue begins with Svetlana saying, “Tomorrow is the first day of junior high.  Are you ready?”  “Junior high” is sometimes called “middle school.”  In the United States, we have most schools divided into “elementa ry,” which is grades one, two, three, four, five, and usually six.  We have “m iddle school,” which is typically grades seven and eight, or six, seven, and eight.   This used to be called, when I was in school, “junior high,” and in some places it is.  Some people call it “middle school,” some people call it “junior high.”  the grades after that – 9, 10, 11, and 12 – are called “senior high.”  Every city in the  United States is a little different.  It sounds strange, but every city – every local a rea has its own school organization, but generally speaking, junior high is for  those children who are ages 12, 13, maybe 14.

Quinn says that he is ready; he says, “Sure, it’s not that b ig a deal,” meaning it’s not that important or it’s not that big of a change f or him to worry about.  He says, “I already put some supplies in my new backpack.”  “Supplie s” is a general word for things that you need to have to do something.  You  may need supplies to build a house; you’ll need supplies to run your office – you’ll need all sorts of things.  That general term is called “supplies,” thing s you use in order to accomplish another task.  A “backpack” (one word) is a thick cl oth bag; usually it has many pockets.  These are used by school children and by col lege students to carry their books and their school supplies.  They’re call ed a “backpack.”  You can also have a backpack if you are, for example, going camp ing.  You have a big bag, basically, on the back of your shoulders that you use for all of your clothing, your sleeping bag, and so forth.

Svetlana says, “Let’s see.  You have some folders, a three- ring binder, and a pen.”  A “folder” is a large piece of thick paper, like  cardboard, that is folded so that you can put papers inside of it.  A “three-ring b inder” is a large piece of plastic that looks like a book.  It has three metal rings – three circles – inside of it that you can use to put paper into, and hold paper.  I t’s called a “three-ring

 binder.”  A “pen,” you probably know, is a small tool we  use for writing.  Usually it has a liquid inside, which we call “ink” (ink).

Quinn says, “I don’t have my books yet.”  Svetlana asks him, “I s that all you’re bringing to school?” meaning are you bringing anything else, and Quinn answers, “I don’t have my books yet.  I’ll get those tomorrow morn ing.  What else do I need?”  He says, “I’m not in the second grade.”  Rememb er, he’s in junior high, so he’s in sixth, seventh, or eighth grade.  He says, “I do n’t need things like glue, crayons, and construction paper.”  These are three things t hat you might buy for a child in elementary school – a younger child.  “Glue” is a white or clear liquid that you use to make things stick together.  Children oft en use glue in making projects at school, making things – young children do.  A “ crayon” is a long piece of colored wax, basically.  It’s similar to a pen or a pen cil; it’s used by children to draw things on a piece of paper.  Finally, “construction paper” are large thick pieces of usually colored paper that children use for thin gs like their art projects at school; again, something you would find in an eleme ntary school for younger children.  The word “construction” has a couple of diff erent meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanatio ns.

Talking about crayons, there was, and still is, a maker of crayons here in the United States called Crayola (Crayola).  And this company made different sets of crayons: you had a very small set that had eight colors, the n you could get a 16- color set, and, I think, the biggest was a 64-color set.  Of course, all the children wanted to have the 64-color set; my parents just got me the eight-color set.  It’s something that I still think about, many years later!

Svetlana, whose name I’m sure I’m going to mispronounce at least once during this dialogue, says, “No (you don’t need those things), b ut you’re missing a lot of stuff (a lot of things).  I should know,” she says, meani ng I have the experience or the intelligence to know something.  “You have a pen,  but no pencils.”  A “pencil” is like a pen, except it uses something called “graphite”  instead of ink; usually it’s made of wood.  With a pencil, you can easily erase the ma rks that you make; you can get rid of them with something called an “eraser,” which is a small piece of rubber or plastic, often in the color pink here in the U.S., that’s used to remove the marks you make with your pencil.  Many pencils have an eraser on the opposite end, the end that you don’t use to write wit h.

So, Svetlana says that Quinn has no erasers or highlighter s.  A “highlighter” is a pen that has a very bright, very easy to see color, and you can take it and you can put this pen on a piece of paper to mark a certain se ction, to write over those words, but you can still see the words underneath the c olor.  The verb is “to highlight,” to put a line over the words so that peopl e will see them more easily.

 She continues, “You have a three-ring binder, but you d on’t have any ruled paper or a notebook.”  “Ruled paper” (ruled) is paper that has “horizontal” lines, from side to side, that indicate where you should write.  Rul ed paper is used in many – perhaps most schools to help children and adults to write more clearly.  A “notebook” is a small book of paper that you can write  on.  It’s blank; that is it doesn’t have anything on it other than the lines usually.   In a notebook, you can take a page out one at a time, and the rest of the p ages stay in the notebook.

Quinn say, “I don’t need all of that stuff on the first  day!”  His friend says, “You want to be prepared, don’t you?  Where are your inde x cards?”  An “index card” is a small piece of thick paper, usually three inches by five inches, and it has blue lines on it.  It’s white paper with blue lines that you  use to write down pieces of information on.  They’re useful in that you can organize  your index cards if you are taking notes on a particular subject.  This is what te achers always tell their students to do, although I never, myself, actually used ind ex cards that way, and I don’t know anyone who did.  Some students use index card s to try to memorize things, to study certain facts for example.  This is usually a pretty inefficient way of learning something for the long-term, but it will  help you pass the test.

She also says, “Don’t you have a calculator?”  A “calculator”  is a small electronic machine that adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, does oth er mathematical operations.  “You’ll need it for your math class,” she sa ys.

Quinn says, “Are you kidding me?!” meaning “are you joking  with me?”  “If I carry all of that plus (or in addition to) my books, who will  carry me  to class?” suggesting that that’s too much, that it’s so heavy that he  won’t be able to carry it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Svetlana:  Tomorrow is the first day of junior high.  Are you ready?

Quinn:  Sure, it’s not that big a deal.  I already p ut some supplies in my new backpack.

Svetlana:  Let’s see.  You have some folders, a three-rin g binder, and a pen.  Is that all you’re bringing to school?

 Quinn:  I don’t have my books yet.  I’ll get those tomor row morning.  What else do I need?  I’m not in the second grade.  I don’t nee d things like glue, crayons, and construction paper.

Svetlana:  No, but you’re missing a lot of stuff.  I shou ld know.  You have a pen, but no pencils.  You have no erasers or highlighters.  You have a three-ring binder, but you don’t have any ruled paper or a noteb ook.

Quinn:  I don’t need all of that stuff on the first d ay!

Svetlana:  You want to be prepared, don’t you?  Where  are your index cards? Don’t you have a calculator?  You’ll need it for your ma th class.

Quinn:  Are you kidding me?!  If I carry all of that pl us my books, who will carry me to class?

# Understanding Drug Labels

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 03: Understanding Drug Labels.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 403.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  Download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample se ntences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Understanding Drug Labels.”  It’s a dialogue between Bernie and Gloria about some typical vocabulary that you  will find if you are looking at medication; that is, drugs.  This can be very i mportant, especially if you are in an English-speaking country and need to takes some d rugs that you buy, so let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bernie:  Oh, I’m in so much pain!  Where is the medicat ion we got from the pharmacy?

Gloria:  It’s right here, but we need to read the la bel first.  Okay, these are the active ingredients and they seem okay.  This warning says th at we need to watch out for any allergic reactions.  It also says to ask your docto r before using it if you have heart problems.

Bernie:  I don’t.  Can you just give me the medication ?

Gloria:  I’m checking to make sure the seal under the c ap isn’t broken, just to be on the safe side.  I also need to read the dosage info rmation so you’ll know how much to take.  It says, “Adults (12 years or older): Two t ablets every four hours; do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 hours.”

Bernie:  That’s fine.  That’s fine.  Where is the pre scription medication from my doctor?

Gloria:  Here it is.  This one has several warnings.  It says that it may cause drowsiness or dizziness.  It also says, “This drug may impair you r ability to drive.”

 Bernie:  I don’t plan to drive today or any day soon.  N ow will you please give me my medication?

Gloria:  I will as soon as I get this childproof cap of f.

Bernie:  I may be dead by then!

[end of dialogue]

We’re talking, in this episode, about drug labels.  A “ label” is a small piece of paper, usually that is put on the medicine bottle – the  container where the medicine is kept.  The label has writing on it that give s you the name of the product, in this case, the drug.  You can also have labels on cans, things that have food inside of them, and so forth.  “Label” is a g eneral term for a little piece of paper that tells you what is inside something.

Bernie begins by saying, “Oh, I’m in so much pain (I’m in  a lot of pain)!  Where is the medication we got from the pharmacy?” he asks.  “Medi cation” is just another word for medicine or drugs.  It’s a liquid or a pill t hat you would, perhaps, “swallow,” or put into your body to make you feel bette r.  A “pharmacy” is a store that sells medicine and other drugs; we sometimes call it a “drugstore.”  The two terms, “pharmacy” and “drugstore” in the U.S. are used “interchangeably,” meaning you can use one for the other; it doesn’t matte r.  Some people call a pharmacy only that part of the store, or only a story tha t sells drugs that you need a prescription for.  A “prescription” is basically permission  from a doctor that says you can take this drug.

Gloria says, “It’s right here, but we need to read the label first.  Okay,” she says, “these are the active ingredients and they seem okay.”  The  “active ingredients” are the things that you put into a drug that actually m akes you healthier – that makes you better.  Drugs sometimes have other ingredient s that are used, but the active ingredients are the most important ones.  An “ingredient” is what you use to make something else, usually something you eat.  So , you can talk about the ingredients of a salad, which would be lettuce, tom atoes, etc.

Gloria says, “This warning says that we need to watch out for any allergic reactions.”  A “warning” is a statement describing some da nger, something bad that might happen.  It’s letting you know that there m ight be a problem and yet you need to be careful.  To “watch out for” something means to make sure something doesn’t happen, usually something dangerous to make that it sure doesn’t happen, or to be looking for this bad thing.  For example, “Watch out for

 the cars on the street,” you might say to a child crossing the street.  “Watch out for” means look for something, in this case, something that could be dangerous.

The “allergic reactions” are things that the body does w hen it is exposed to certain kinds of chemicals or other things; it’s a bad thin g that happens to the body.  Some people have allergic reactions to, for exampl e, the drug penicillin. Their body doesn’t like the drug, and so they will have  this reaction.  Maybe their skin will turn red or they’ll have difficulty breathing; these are allergic reactions. “Allergic” comes from the word “allergy” (allergy), whi ch are things that bother you, often causing you to sneeze or to have difficulty breat hing, for example.

The dialogue continues by Gloria saying the label “also s ays to ask your doctor before using it if you have heart problems.”  Some medi cines you can’t use because you have other medical conditions, so this would be  an example of that. Bernie says, “I don’t (I don’t have any heart problems).  Can you just give me the medication?”  Bernie, remember, is feeling pain so he wants the drug right away. Gloria, however, says, “I’m checking to make sure the seal  under the cap isn’t broken, just to be on the safe side.”  In medicine sold in the United States, there’s almost always a “seal” on the top of the bottle.  This i s a small piece of plastic that is put on the bottle so that nothing can be put in or nothing can be taken out. This is for safety reasons, so no one tries to hurt you by putting something in your medication that you don’t know about that is bad for you.  This, unfortunately, has happened in the past.  The “cap” is t he top of the bottle.  It’s also sometimes called a “lid,” depending on how it’s put  on the bottle.  But, a cap is usually something that you turn to take off, and then you can get inside of the bottle.  Both “seal” and “cap” have a couple of diffe rent meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional expla nations.

So, Gloria says she’s checking the seal under the cap to make sure it isn’t broken, meaning that someone hasn’t taken the seal off,  that someone hasn’t put something bad into the bottle.  She says she wants “to b e on the safe side.”  The expression “to be on the safe side” means that you are trying to make sure something bad doesn’t happen.  Even though it might no t be necessary to do this, you want to be safe; you want to be extra cautious – extra safe.

Gloria says, “I also need to read the dosage information  so you’ll know how much to take.”  The “dosage” (dosage) is how much medicine you  should take, and how often.  It may be one pill in the morning and on e pill in the afternoon; that would be the “dosage.”  The dosage says: “Adults (12 or older): Two tablets (two pills) every four hours; do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 ho urs.”  To “exceed” (exceed) means to do or to take more of something than yo u should.  So, if it

 says “do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 hours,” that means tha t you should not take more than 12 pills in one day.

Bernie says, “That’s fine.  That’s fine.  Where is the pr escription medication from my doctor?”  A “prescription,” we already know, is special m edicine the doctor gives you that you need the doctor’s permission for in orde r to buy.  Gloria says, “Here it is.”  She says, “This one has several warnings.  I t says that it may cause drowsiness or dizziness.”  Sometimes certain pills – certain m edications cause you to be “drowsy” (drowsy).  That’s just another word for  “sleepy,” feeling very tired.  “Dizziness” is a feeling that everything in the ro om is moving around you, usually in circles, when, in fact, nothing is moving.  Di zziness can cause you to fall down.

So, some drugs may cause dizziness, and you have to be careful .  Gloria says that the label on this bottle says, “This drug may impai r your ability to drive.”  To “impair” (impair) means to make something worse, or to  make something not work as well as it normally does.  If you say, “Her vision is impaired,” we mean she doesn’t see as well as she should.  So, the “drug ma y impair your ability to drive,” it may make you unable to drive as well as you shou ld.

Bernie says, “I don’t plan to drive today or any day soon.   Now will you please give me my medication?”  Gloria says, “I will (I will give  it to you) as soon as I get this childproof cap off.”  Something that is “childproo f” (one word) is a container that is designed to be difficult for a young child to open.  This is especially important for drugs.  We don’t want young children go ing into your room and opening up a pill bottle and hurting themselves by takin g this drug, so most drugs have a childproof top.  The joke is that the childproof top is often very difficult even for an adult to get off, and so some people compl ain about that.

Gloria is having difficulty getting the childproof cap of f.  Bernie says, “I may be dead by then!” meaning by the time you have the cap off it will be too late, I’ll be dead, because, of course, Bernie has been waiting all this time to get the pain medication.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Bernie:  Oh, I’m in so much pain!  Where is the medicat ion we got from the pharmacy?

 Gloria:  It’s right here, but we need to read the la bel first.  Okay, these are the active ingredients and they seem okay.  This warning says th at we need to watch out for any allergic reactions.  It also says to ask your docto r before using it if you have heart problems.

Bernie:  I don’t.  Can you just give me the medication ?

Gloria:  I’m checking to make sure the seal under the c ap isn’t broken, just to be on the safe side.  I also need to read the dosage info rmation so you’ll know how much to take.  It says, “Adults (12 years or older): Two t ablets every four hours; do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 hours.”

Bernie:  I may be dead by then!

# Delegating Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 04: Delegating Work.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 404.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Delegating Work.”  It’s a dialogu e between Anya and Estevan talking about how you give other people work whe n you are a boss or a manager.  It uses a lot of vocabulary that you might use i n talking about how you are giving other people work.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anya:  I don’t know how I’m going to get all of this w ork done before I go on vacation.

Estevan:  What you need to do is to delegate.  Stop bei ng a control freak and get other people to help you with your work.

Anya:  I’ve tried to delegate before, but I ended up having to redo the work myself.  It was no timesaver at all.  It definitely wasn ’t worth the trouble.

Estevan:  That’s because you have to delegate in the righ t way.  You can’t just assign a project to one of your employees.  You have to gi ve them explicit instructions and measurable goals.

Anya:  I did that.  I gave my employee detailed instructi ons and she still let me down.

Estevan:  I bet you didn’t ask her to report back to you p eriodically, did you?  To get results, you have to tell your employees to give you progress reports.  That way, you can make sure she’s on the right track.  See what I  mean?

Anya:  Okay, maybe you’re right.  I know one thing.  If I don’t get some help soon, I’ll be spending my vacation at my desk!

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Anya saying, “I don’t know how I’m going to get all of this work done before I go on vacation.”  Estevan says, “What you need to do is to delegate.”  To “delegate” means to give other peop le part of the work that you are supposed to do; asking other people, in other words,  to help you with your work – to give them things to do.

Estevan says, “Stop being a control freak and get other p eople to help you with your work.”  The expression “control freak” (freak) describe s a person who likes to be in control of everything, someone who doesn’t like other people helping them.  A control freak is usually considered a negative desc ription of someone, although some people say, “Well, I’m a control freak.  I  want everything to be done just the way I like it,” which means you have to do it all yourself, usually.

Anya says, “I’ve tried to delegate before, but I ended u p having to redo the work myself.”  To “end up” is a phrasal verb that means to be  in a certain situation after or because of other things that have happened, us ually things that you didn’t expect to happen.  So for example: “After studyin g to be a doctor for seven years, he ended up running a website instead.”  You wo uld expect after studying to be a doctor that he would eventually then become a d octor, but instead something unexpected happened: he ended up working as a  website operator.  I actually read a story in the newspaper the other day abou t a doctor who did just that.

Anya said she had to “redo,” meaning to do something a gain, usually it’s something that wasn’t done right in the first place.  S he had to redo the work herself.  She said, “It was no timesaver at all.”  A “t imesaver” (one word) is something that allows you to do something in less time t han usual.  For example, a washing machine is a timesaver; you don’t have to wash the clothes by hand. A microwave oven can be a timesaver; it takes less time to c ook something in the microwave than it does in a regular oven.  Of course, it usually doesn’t taste as good either, but that’s one of the “compromises,” that ’s one of the things we give up for something that saves us time.  Anya says, “It defini tely wasn’t worth the trouble.”  To be “worth the trouble” means to have b enefits or advantages that are greater than the work you needed to do something .  So for example, if it takes you five hours to make an apple pie, you may say, “Wel l, it wasn’t worth the trouble” – it wasn’t that good, it wasn’t worth m y time.  We might just say, simply, it wasn’t “worthwhile.”

Estevan says, “That’s because you have to delegate in the rig ht way,” in the correct manner.  “You can’t just assign a project to one of your employees,” he

 says.  To “assign,” here, means to tell someone to do some thing; it’s what a boss will do with his or her workers.  It’s what a teacher do es to his or her students: she assigns homework to her students.  I used to assign to m y students at the university when I taught there.  Of course, they never act ually did the homework, but I did assign them to do it!  “Assign” has a couple of  different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Estevan says, “You have to give (your employees) explicit instr uctions and measurable goals.”  Something that is “explicit” (explici t) is something that is clear, obvious, and easy to understand; something that i s very specific without anything being hidden or assumed.  To give someone “mea surable goals” means to give them an “objective,” something you want them to achieve or accomplish that can be measured – you know how they are doing on it.  Anything that is “measurable” is something that you know how big or small , or how much of that thing there is.  A “goal” is an objective, an “aim,” we  might say.

Estevan tells Anya that she has to give her employees explici t instructions and measurable goals.  Anya says, however, “I did that.  I gave  my employee detailed instructions and she let me down.”  To “let someone down ” is a phrasal verb meaning to disappoint someone, not to meet someone’s exp ectations.  “My students let me down when they handed in their homewor k” – it was not as good as I was hoping it would be.

Estevan says, “I bet you didn’t ask her to report back to you periodically, did you?”  To “report back” to someone means to give someone  information about how you are doing – how you are progressing, how much wo rk you are getting done.  To report back means to give someone an “update,”  recent, current information about how they are doing.  Estevan says that Anya probably didn’t ask her employee to report back to her periodically.  “Per iodically” means at a certain time, evenly spaced, for example every week or ev ery month or every two months; something happens on a regular schedule, you coul d say.  He says, “To get results, you have to tell your employees to give you progress reports.  To “get results” means to be able to do what you want to do, to  “meet your goals,” we would say.  A “progress report” is written or spoken infor mation about how you are doing, how well you are doing.  It’s similar to an  update – a “progress report,” how much have you done.  “That way,” Estevan says, if you ge t progress reports, “you can make sure she’s on the right track.”  To “be on the right track” (track) means to do something the correct way – the right way – to make progress on something and to be doing it correctly.  You’re not fin ished yet, but you are “making good progress,” we would say.  You are getting t hings done when you should be getting them done, and moving closer to your goal – your objective.

 Anya says, “Okay, maybe you’re right.  I know one thing.  I f I don’t get some help soon, I’ll be spending my vacation at my desk!”  Remember,  she’s going on vacation and she needs someone to help her with her work.   I feel this way all the time – except, I never get a vacation!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Anya:  I don’t know how I’m going to get all of this w ork done before I go on vacation.

Estevan:  What you need to do is to delegate.  Stop bei ng a control freak and get other people to help you with your work.

Anya:  I’ve tried to delegate before, but I ended up having to redo the work myself.  It was no timesaver at all.  It definitely wasn ’t worth the trouble.

Estevan:  That’s because you have to delegate in the righ t way.  You can’t just assign a project to one of your employees.  You have to gi ve them explicit instructions and measurable goals.

Anya:  I did that.  I gave my employee detailed instructi ons and she still let me down.

Estevan:  I bet you didn’t ask her to report back to you p eriodically, did you?  To get results, you have to tell your employees to give you progress reports.  That way, you can make sure she’s on the right track.  See what I  mean?

Anya:  Okay, maybe you’re right.  I know one thing.  If I don’t get some help soon, I’ll be spending my vacation at my desk!

# Buying Computer Accessories

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 05: Buying Computer Accessories.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 405.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

If you go to our website at eslpod.com you can download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definit ions, sample sentences using the vocabulary, additional definitions not discussed  on the episode, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and, if that weren’t eno ugh, a complete transcript of this episode.

This episode is called “Buying Computer Accessories.”  An “acce ssory” is something you buy that works with something else; it’s some thing that helps you or improves on another product.  This is going to be a d ialogue between Kevin and Ginger about buying things for your computer, so we’ ll have lots of vocabulary related to the computer.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ginger:  It’s really nice of you to come with me to buy m y computer.  This is the desktop I’m thinking about.

Kevin:  This is okay, but if I were you, I’d buy a laptop.   It’s more versatile.  You can travel with it.

Ginger:  I’m not sure about getting a laptop.  The screen is so small.

Kevin:  No problem.  You can get a separate monitor.  This is a good one.  You just need a connector and a cable to hook it up to your l aptop.  Here’s a monitor stand, too, so you can elevate it if you want to.

Ginger: The speakers on the laptop aren’t very loud.

Kevin:  You can get these great speakers.  You plug them into your laptop and the sound is amazing.

Ginger:  I’m not sure about the battery.

 Kevin:  It comes with a battery that lasts three to five h ours, but you can always buy a spare.  Of course, it comes with a power cord, too , so you can just plug it in if your battery runs low.

Ginger:  The keyboard is a little cramped, too.

Kevin:  That’s what a full-size keyboard is for.  You can buy a separate keyboard and mouse and attach them to your laptop.  It’ll be j ust like having a desktop.

Ginger:  Then why don’t I just buy a desktop?

Kevin:  If you do, you won’t be able to buy all of the se great accessories.  That’s half the fun of buying a new computer!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ginger saying, “It’s really nice  of you to come with me to buy my computer.  This is the desktop I’m thinking abou t.”  Ginger says, “This is the desktop.”  The “desktop,” here, refers to the deskto p computer, which is a computer that has a large machine and usually a separate “monitor,” the thing that you use to see what’s on your computer; it has a scre en that you look at.  A “desktop,” then, is a machine – a computer that is separat e, usually, from the monitor.

Kevin says, “This is okay (this desktop is okay), but if I were you, I’d buy a laptop.”  A “laptop” (laptop) is sometimes called a “n otebook” computer; it’s a small computer that you can fold up and put in a bag o r in a backpack.  Kevin says the laptop is “more versatile.”  “Versatile” (versati le) is something that has many different uses, something that can be used in diff erent ways.  You could say, “That person is versatile, she can do different things for her company.”

Kevin says you can travel with a laptop computer.  Ginger sa ys, “I’m not sure about getting a laptop.”  She’s says, “The screen is so smal l.”  The “screen” is the part of the computer monitor that you look at, as we me ntioned before.  Kevin says, “No problem.  You can get a separate monitor” – you  can get a separate piece of equipment that you can put on your desk that h as the screen on it.  “This is a good one,” Kevin says, “You just need a connector a nd a cable to hook it up to your laptop.”  A “connector” is something that helps yo u put one piece of electronic equipment together with something else.  A co nnector usually has holes in it, on one or both ends, and it plugs into som e electronic device.  A “cable” is the long piece of wire, usually covered in plast ic that connects two pieces of electronic equipment.  So, a cable will typical ly have a connector on

 both ends, one for one piece of equipment, the other  for the other piece of equipment.  To “hook something up” means to connect two things together, usually electronic things: “I hooked up my DVD player to my television” – I connected it so I could watch a DVD movie.

Kevin says, “Here’s a monitor stand, too, so you can elevate  it if you want to.”  To “elevate” means to raise, to make something higher, to m ove something up.  If you go into a large building, they’ll typically have somet hing called “elevators,” which is a noun, comes from the verb to “elevate,” means to go up, it takes you up into the building.  It’s a small box that “elevates, ” or goes up.  Kevin says that the monitor stand will elevate the computer monitor.  The “monitor stand” is a piece of plastic or metal that you can put a monitor on top of, so it’s a little higher up off your desk.  That’s a “monitor stand.”

Ginger says, “The speakers on the laptop aren’t very loud. ”  “Speakers” are parts of a radio or a computer or a television that we use to  listen to music, to people talking, to this podcast perhaps; you may have speakers.  Usua lly a speaker is something that more than one person can hear.  If it’s just one person putting it into their ears, those things are called “earbuds” or “h eadphones.”  But, a speaker is something that is meant for many different peo ple to hear.

So, Ginger is complaining that the speakers are too “sof t,” they’re not loud enough.  Kevin says, “You can get these great speakers.  Yo u plug them into your laptop and the sound is amazing.”  To “plug somethi ng into something else” is to connect a piece of electronic equipment to another piece of electronic equipment, or to some source of electricity.  For exampl e, if you have a computer you will plug it into the wall; you will get electricit y from your wall – from your electrical system in your house.  So, you can plug something  in to get electricity – to get power, or you can plug something in as a way of connecting two pieces of equipment.  Kevin is suggesting that Ginger can buy thes e speakers, and then plug them into her computer so she can have better sound .  She doesn’t have to use the speakers that are “built-in” to the laptop, tha t are part of the laptop frame – the laptop container or case, we would say.

Ginger says, “I’m not sure about the battery” (on the la ptop).  The “battery” is what stores electricity; it “stores,” or keeps, power so you can use something without having to plug it into the wall for electricit y.  Your cell phone has a battery; most laptop computers have a battery.

Kevin says the laptop “comes with a battery (meaning it is sold with a battery) that lasts (that will be good for) three to five hours (of use), but you can always buy a spare.”  A “spare” (spare) is an extra copy of somet hing – an extra piece of

 something, usually in case something that you have breaks an d you need another one right away.  For example in your car, if you  have a car, you may have a spare tire.  The “tire” is the part of the car t hat goes around the wheels and allows you to drive on a street.  A “spare tire” is a n extra tire; in case you have one tire that doesn’t work properly you can put on  the extra – the spare tire. So, you can have a spare battery for your laptop as well.   He says, “Of course, (the laptop) comes with a power cord, too, so you can just  plug it in if your battery runs low.”  A “power cord” is a long cable that connects your piece of electronics to the source of electricity in the wall.  So, you “plug  in” the power cord; it’s a cable that connects something to a wall where you have e lectricity.

Ginger then says, “The keyboard is a little cramped, too.”   The “keyboard” is the part of the computer that you type on, that has lette rs and numbers that you can hit.  We call those “keys.”  To say something is “cramped” me ans it is very close together, too close together.  You might say it’s “crowd ed.”  You might walk into a room and say, “It’s cramped in here.  It’s so small; ther e are too many people here.”  That is to be “cramped.”  Ginger says the keyboard  is cramped; it’s too small.  Kevin says you can buy a “full-sized,” a bigger, keybo ard and a mouse and attach them to your computer.

Ginger says, “Then why don’t I just buy a desktop?”  Kevin says, “If you do, you won’t be able to buy all these great accessories.  That’s half the fun of buying a new computer!”  When we say something is “half the fun, ” we mean that’s part of the excitement – that’s part of the fun of doing someth ing.  Kevin is suggesting that buying all these extra things is part of the fun of  buying a computer.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ginger:  It’s really nice of you to come with me to buy m y computer.  This is the desktop I’m thinking about.

Kevin:  This is okay, but if I were you, I’d buy a laptop.   It’s more versatile.  You can travel with it.

# Participating in Internet Discussion Groups

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 06: Participating in Internet Discussion Groups.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 406.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode. The Learning Guides contains all of the vocabulary, defi nitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions , cultural notes, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.  All that is on our website with our Learning Guides.

This episode is a conversation between Dale and Jessie talki ng about something which is very popular, Internet forums, or Internet discussi on groups.  I’ll talk about some vocabulary that you will commonly find when you are talking about these kinds of Internet groups.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Dale:  I didn’t know you read that forum.  What’s your  screen name?

Jessie:  It’s “jessiegirl,” but I don’t post very often.  I  like to lurk and follow the different threads, but I prefer to keep a low profile .

Dale:  Really?  I post all the time.  I just put my new  web address on my profile, and check this out.  It’s my new avatar.

Jessie:  That’s cool.  I’ve been trying to figure out how to upload a picture for my avatar.  Are there instructions in the FAQs?

Dale:  I’m not sure, but I can show you how to do it.  Have you been following the thread about the presidential campaign?

Jessie:  Yeah, I had been...until today.

Dale:  Why’s that?

Jessie:  I stopped reading when this one guy, “bigman,” st arted to flame everybody, saying that anyone who didn’t agree with him is an idiot.

 Dale:  Oh, really?

Jessie:  Yeah, he started posting replies, writing in all  caps and letting people have it.  He quoted people out of context and attacked them.  What a jerk!

Dale:  Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk.

Jessie:  Hey, what did you say your screen name is?

Dale:  Never mind.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Dale saying, “I didn’t know you  read that forum.  What’s your screen name?”  A “forum” is another name for an In ternet discussion group, where people write on a website and communicate about a particular topic.  Your “screen name” is usually a short name or a combination of letters and numbers that someone uses to identify him or herself.  Many peop le don’t want to use their real names, so they come up with these screen names that t hey use instead.

Jessie responds by saying, “It’s ‘jessiegirl,’” meaning her scre en name is “jessiegirl.”  She says, “I don’t post very often.”  To “po st means to put text, or photographs, or video, or something else on a website.  For example, I post to our blog – our ESL Podcast Blog about once a week.  You  can post a comment to our blog posts whenever you’d like.  The word “post” h as several different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Jessie says, “I like to lurk (lurk) and follow different th reads.”  To “lurk” (lurk) in a forum or a discussion group means that you go to the for um – you go to the website and you read what other people have written bu t you don’t participate yourself; you don’t post anything – any messages yourself.  T o lurk, in general, means to be sort of hiding so that no one can see you, bu t you’re observing. This is a case where we use that verb to mean you read, bu t you don’t reply – you don’t post.  A “thread” (thread) in an Internet f orum is a group of messages that are responses to each other; they’re a group of rel ated messages.  We can also use this word more generally, for example someone sa ys, “I don’t quite follow the thread of your conversation,” meaning I don ’t quite understand the meaning, how different things are connected to each oth er.  “Thread,” as a noun, is what you use in clothing to keep the clothing together  – to keep different parts of the clothing together.  For example, on a shirt the re are sleeves that go over

 the arms, and those are probably connected or attached to the rest of the shirt using thread.  But “thread,” here, means a group of co nnected messages.

Jessie says that she prefers to keep a low profile.  To “kee p a low profile” means to act in a way so that other people don’t pay very much attention to you – don’t notice you.  I’m going to keep a low profile – I’m going to make sure people don’t interest themselves in me.

Dale says, “Really?  I post all the time.  I just put my n ew web address on my profile, and check this out.  It’s my new avatar.”  So, Da le says he posts a lot; he put his new website – his web address on his profile.  A “profile” is a small collection of information about a person, or perhaps a company.  In many websites you can see other people’s profiles; you can see wha t they’ve said about themselves, perhaps their age, where they live, and  so forth.  An “avatar” (avatar) is a small picture that represents a person on a website, usually something that you create or you select.  And so, you’ll se e your name and then underneath you’ll see an avatar.  Most forums don’t req uire an avatar, but people like to put pictures of themselves or their cats or other  imaginary beings as their avatar.  I don’t think I’ve ever used an avatar, but it’ s popular among many people on Internet forums.

Jessie says, “That’s cool.  I’ve been trying to figure out ho w to upload a picture for my avatar.”  To “upload” means to transfer files fr om your computer to a website.  Jessie says, “Are there instructions in the FAQs (o r the frequently asked questions)?”  Most websites have an “FAQ,” or frequen tly asked questions page; it’s a list of the most common questions that peop le ask about a website or a product that is on the website, and it gives the answe rs.  It’s the first place you look on a website for help if there’s something you don ’t understand.

Dale says, “I’m not sure (I’m not sure if there are inst ructions in the FAQs), but I can show you how to do it.  Have you been following the  thread about the presidential campaign?”  Notice the use of the verb “fo llow” – to follow the thread. We said earlier that you could use that in a conversation : “I’m not following the threat of your conversation.”  We also use it in Intern et discussion groups.  To “follow a thread” means to be reading all of the messa ges about a particular topic that are related to each other.

Jessie says, “Yes, I had been (I was following it)...until today.”  Dale says, “Why’s that?” meaning what is the reason why.  Jessie says, “I sto pped reading when this one guy, (with the screen name) ‘bigman,’ started t o flame everybody, saying that anyone who didn’t agree with him is an idiot.”  This is what I think; of course, it’s what we all think, that we’re right about everyth ing!  To “flame” (flame) means

 to send a message or post a note that is considered rude, impolite, angry.  It’s a not very nice thing you say about someone else; often it’ s a personal attack on a person.  “Flame” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

So, Jessie stopped following this thread because there wa s someone who was flaming everybody.  Dale says, “Oh, really?”  Jessie says, “Yea h, he started posting replies, writing in all caps and letting people  have it.”  A “reply” is a response, an answer to a message.  “Caps” (caps) refers to ca pital letters, what we sometimes call “upper case” letters.  Usually you just u se caps, or a capital letter to begin a sentence or a name.  But if you typ e in all caps, many people on the Internet think that’s like shouting.  Instead of usi ng upper and lower case letters, you use all capital letters – all upper case let ters – all caps, it’s considered a little angry or impolite on an Internet f orum.  “To let people have it” – “to let someone have it” means to show someone that you are angry with him or her, usually by yelling or shouting.  “I let him ha ve it” means I shouted at him, I yelled at him, I told him I was angry.

Jessie says this person “quoted people out of context and att acked them.  What a jerk!”  To “quote” someone means to repeat what someo ne else has said; that’s very common on Internet forums.  “Out of context,” here, means taking information and eliminating, or leaving out the surro unding information, the information that tells you what it really means.  So, yo u take one small thing a person said and you remove it from the comments around it that would make it seems sensible or logical, and you use that quote to att ack someone, to imply that they have a different meaning.

Dale says, “Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk” – a bad guy.  Jessie says, “Hey, what did you say your screen name was?”  Jessie’s wondering what Dale’s screen name was, and Dale says, “Never mind.”   “Never mi nd” is a phrase used to show that something is not important and should be forgotten.  Of course, perhaps Dale is this “bigman,” this person who was flamin g other people, and he didn’t want to admit that to his friend Jessie.

I certainly hope you don’t flame anyone on your Interne t forums, if you participate in them.  I don’t generally participate in Internet f orums, but some people really love them and find they are a good way to connect to oth er people.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Dale:  I didn’t know you read that forum.  What’s your  screen name?

Jessie:  It’s “jessiegirl,” but I don’t post very often.  I  like to lurk and follow the different threads, but I prefer to keep a low profile .

Dale:  Really?  I post all the time.  I just put my new  web address on my profile, and check this out.  It’s my new avatar.

# Waiting for a Man or Woman to Call

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 07: Waiting for a Man or Woman to Call.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 407.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8 to 10 page guide we provide that will h elp you improve your English even faster.  You can also take a look at our ESL  Podcast Store, which has additional courses in English.

This episode is a dialogue between Lyla and George abou t waiting for someone you are romantically interested in to call you back on the telephone.  Certainly an experience most of us have had!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lyla:  Okay, here’s a hypothetical.  You ask a girl for her  number, but wait two weeks to call her.  What gives?

George:  Well, that depends.  Why?

Lyla:  Well, I met this guy two weeks ago at a party.  We  spent the entire evening talking and I thought we really hit it off.  We had a  lot of chemistry and we had a ton of things in common.  He asked for my number and he said he’d call me the next day.  And then, I didn’t hear hide nor hair of h im until yesterday, 10 days after we met.  How come?

George:  What did he say when he called?  What was his p athetic excuse?

Lyla:  I didn’t talk to him.  I wasn’t home and he lef t a voicemail message.  I haven’t called him back yet.

George:  Why don’t you just call him and find out?

Lyla:  He just called yesterday and I don’t want to seem d esperate.

George:  Oh, come on.  He probably just lost your number  and found it yesterday.

 Lyla:  That’s possible.

George:  Or he had to go out of town and just got ba ck.

Lyla:  I suppose.

George:  Or maybe he was nervous about calling you and ju st got up the nerve.

Lyla:  Do you really think so?

George:  Maybe.  Or maybe he’s playing hard to get or h e’s just not that into you.

Lyla:  Oh.

George:  But you won’t know if you don’t call him back.

Lyla:  I guess that’s true.

[end of dialogue]

We begin with Lyla saying to George, “Okay, here’s a hy pothetical.”  A “hypothetical” or “hypothetical situation” is a situation that could happen or might happen but has not actually happened, so it’s imaginary.   This is the hypothetical, or hypothetical situation Lyla gives to George: “You ask a  girl for her number (her telephone number), but wait two weeks to call her.”  “ Number” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

So, Lyla is saying what would happen if you asked a girl for her telephone number, and then waited two weeks to call her.  She sa ys, “What gives?” which is an informal expression when you want an explanation of  something that you don’t understand.  Often we use that expression when we ’re a little frustrated perhaps.  So Lyla wants to know, basically, why someone wou ld wait two weeks to call a woman whose number he’s asked for.

George says, “Well, that depends,” meaning it can be de termined by something else; it’s affected or decided by someone else.  When someo ne says “that depends,” they mean it depends on, or is affected by some other information – something else in the situation.  Then he says, “Why?”

 Then Lyla gives the real story, not a hypothetical situatio n.  She says, “Well, I met this guy two weeks ago at a party.  We spent the ent ire evening talking (we talked the whole evening) and I thought we really hit it off.”  To “hit it off” with someone means to get along very well with that person, u sually the first time you meet them; to quickly become friends with another person.   Many people who get married say that the first time they met their future h usband or wife they really hit it off.

Lyla says she hit it off with this gentleman – this man.  She says, “We had a lot of chemistry and we had a ton of things in common.”  “Chemi stry,” when we are talking about a man and a woman or romance, has to do with the attraction between two people – the romantic feelings you have for that other person.  She felt they “had a lot of chemistry and a ton of things in  common.”  A “ton,” here, just means a lot, many, or much.  Technically, a ton refe rs to something that weighs 2,000 pounds, but we use it informally to mean a lot of something.  So, “we had a ton of things,” she says, “in common,” meaning  that we shared similar interests.  “Common” has many definitions in English; take  a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lyla continues, “He asked for my number and he said he’d call me the next day (the following day, the day after).  And then, I didn ’t hear hide nor hair of him until yesterday, 10 days after we met.  How come?”  The expression  not to hear or see “hide (hide) nor hair (hair)” of someone means tha t you haven’t heard from or seen someone for a certain amount of time, usually a lon g time.  Literally, “hair” is, of course, what grows on the top of your head – well , not my head, but most people’s heads!  “Hide” is usually the word we use to desc ribe the skin of an animal, such as a cow.  But the expression, “I haven’t seen  hide nor hair,” means I haven’t seen anything or heard anything from this perso n in a long time.

At the end she asks George, “How come?”  “How come?” is a way of saying why, it’s the same thing as “what gives?” – somewhat informal expression.  For what reason, you’re asking.  It can usually be used the same as “why.”  For example: “How come you are going to the movies with him and not with me (why are you going to the movies with him and not me)?” and she says,  “Oh, well, you’re ugly!” So, that’s how come!

George says, “What did he say when he called?  What was his pathetic excuse?” When we say something is “pathetic” (pathetic), we mean it’s irritating, it’s annoying, it’s not adequate, it’s not enough.  It’s a ve ry negative way of describing a situation or a person.

 Lyla says, “I didn’t talk to him.  I wasn’t home and he l eft a voicemail message.  I haven’t called him back yet” – I haven’t returned his call .  George says, “Why don’t you just call him and find out?” – why don’t you ca ll him and ask him why he didn’t call you for so long?  Lyla says, “He just called yeste rday and I don’t want to seem (or appear) desperate.”  Someone who is “despe rate” is willing to do anything to make something happen; someone who is very ea ger for something to happen, perhaps because you don’t have any other choi ces or options.  Lyla says she doesn’t want to seem desperate; she doesn’t want to seem as though she is the one who really wants to go out with this guy.  This is a little game that men and women play, of course.  When they first are int erested in each other, neither one wants to seem as though they need the other  person.  That’s just part of the strange human romantic reactions that we ha ve.

George says, “Oh, come on (meaning oh, be reasonable – be sensible).  He probably just lost your number and found it yesterday.”  Lyla says, “That’s possible.”  George says, “Or he had to go out of town (h e had to leave the city) and just got back (just returned).”  Lyla says, “I suppose,” meaning okay, maybe. George then gives another possible reason, “Or maybe he was nervous about calling you and just got up the nerve.”  To “get up the nerve” (nerve) means to become brave enough to do something, to get enough co urage to do something. You may have to get up the nerve to ask your boss for a r aise – for more money.

Lyla says, “Do you really think so?”  George says, “Maybe.  O r maybe he’s playing hard to get or he’s just not that into you.”  T o “play hard to get” means to act like you are not interested in, even though you are interested.  This, again, is a game that men and women play with each other – boys a nd girls as well.  You give the impression to the other person that you are n ot that interested, hoping that they’ll be more interested in you.  Some people are attracted to others who are difficult to get – who are difficult to get a rel ationship with.  You play hard to get – you act as though you don’t want to be with that  person.  The other possibility George gives is that this man is “just not that  into you.”  When we say someone is “not into” someone, we mean they aren’t inte rested in them romantically – they’re not interested in dating that pe rson.  You could say, “Oh, he’s just not that into you,” or “She’s just not that in to you,” meaning he or she doesn’t really like you.

Lyla say, “Oh.”  George then says, “But you won’t know if you don’t call him back.”  That is, you can’t find out the truth unless you cal l him.  Lyla says, “I guess that’s true.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Lyla:  Okay, here’s a hypothetical.  You ask a girl for her  number, but wait two weeks to call her.  What gives?

George:  Well, that depends.  Why?

Lyla:  Well, I met this guy two weeks ago at a party.  We  spent the entire evening talking and I thought we really hit it off.  We had a  lot of chemistry and we had a ton of things in common.  He asked for my number and he said he’d call me the next day.  And then, I didn’t hear hide nor hair of h im until yesterday, 10 days after we met.  How come?

George:  What did he say when he called?  What was his p athetic excuse?

Lyla:  I didn’t talk to him.  I wasn’t home and he lef t a voicemail message.  I haven’t called him back yet.

George:  Why don’t you just call him and find out?

Lyla:  He just called yesterday and I don’t want to seem d esperate.

George:  Oh, come on.  He probably just lost your number  and found it yesterday.

Lyla:  That’s possible.

George:  Or he had to go out of town and just got ba ck.

Lyla:  I suppose.

George:  Or maybe he was nervous about calling you and ju st got up the nerve.

Lyla:  Do you really think so?

George:  Maybe.  Or maybe he’s playing hard to get or h e’s just not that into you.

Lyla:  Oh.

George:  But you won’t know if you don’t call him back.

Lyla:  I guess that’s true.

# Calling Someone You Haven¡¦t Met About a Job

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 08: Calling Someone You Haven’t Met About a Job.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 408.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode. The Learning Guide is an 8 to 10 page guide we produ ce for all of our current episodes that includes the complete transcript of everything  we say on this episode, as well as vocabulary, definitions, cultural notes,  comprehension questions, and additional definitions that we don’t di scuss on the episode.

This episode is called “Calling Someone You Haven’t Met About a Job.”  It’s a telephone conversation between someone who is looking f or a job and someone who works at the company where this person wants to work.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Candace:  Hello.

Mehdi:  Hello, may I speak to Candace Cho, please?

Candace:  Speaking.

Mehdi:  Oh, hello Ms. Cho.  My name is Mehdi and I’m i nterested in applying for the job as assistant manager.  Your name was listed as the  contact person.  Am I calling at a bad time?

Candace:  No, not at all.  I’m the administrative assist ant and I’m fielding calls for the person doing the hiring.  What can I do for you?

Mehdi:  Well, I read the job description and I think I  would be a good fit, but I was wondering if there are any special qualifications not me ntioned in the description.

Candace:  Well, requirements are spelled out in the description, and I don’t have much to add, really.  But I do know that the person doi ng the hiring is looking for someone to start immediately.  Can you do that?

 Mehdi:  Sure, that’s no problem.  I’ll be sure to men tion that in my cover letter. Thanks.

Candace:  If you’ve had experience managing a large staff , be sure to emphasize that in your résumé.  Any other questions?

Mehdi:  No, no other questions.  Thank you very much for your time.  You’ve been very helpful.

Candace:  Your questions show a lot of initiative.  I’m sure you’ll do fine.

Mehdi:  Thanks, I really appreciate the vote of confidence .

[end of dialogue]

The telephone conversation begins with Candace picking u p the phone and saying, “Hello.”  Mehdi says, “Hello, may I speak to Candac e Cho, please?”  The expression “may I speak to...” is a polite way of asking someo ne on the telephone to speak to a specific person: “Hello.  May I s peak to the manager, please?”

Candace responds, “Speaking.”  If you answer the phone a nd someone asks for you but doesn’t know that it is you who is talking on the phone, you say “speaking.”  In other words, the person you are asking for  is speaking: “I am that person.”  That’s another way of saying “speaking” – yes, th is is me.

Mehdi says, “Oh, hello Ms. Cho.”  Notice that in business,  “Ms.” is the most common way of addressing a woman.  “My name is Mehdi and  I’m interested in applying for the job as assistant manager.  Your name wa s listed as the contact person.”  So, Mehdi is saying that he wants to apply for the job; he wants to fill out an application and be interviewed.  Candace Cho wa s listed as the contact person.  “Listed,” here, just means her name appeared in the advertisement. The “contact person” is the person who you call or write  to if you want more information about something.

Mehdi says, “Am I calling at a bad time?”  This is a poli te phrase we use to make sure that the person that we are calling, who may not b e expecting our call – who didn’t know we were going to call – is not busy, that t hey don’t have something else they need to do instead of talking to you on the te lephone.  It also gives them an opportunity to say, “Well, yes, this is a busy time .  Can you call me back tomorrow at 10 o’clock?” for example.

 Candace says, “No, not at all,” meaning no, this is not a  bad time, which is another way of saying yes, this is a good time, I can talk n ow.  She says, “I’m the administrative assistant and I’m fielding calls for the person doing the hiring.”  An “administrative assistant” is another word or term for a secretary, or someone who does work in an office to help other employees, such a s answering phones and emails, writing letters, making photocopies, and so f orth.  We used to just call these people secretaries, but now we call the admin istrative assistants; it sounds more important.

Candace says she’s “fielding calls.”  To “field (field) call s” means to answer phone calls for someone else – for another person, usuall y a more important person, someone that you are working for who doesn’t wa nt to answer his or her own phone calls.  So, to “field calls” also means to deci de which phone calls are important enough to give to the person you work for.  T his verb, “to field,” has a couple of interesting different meanings in English: ta ke a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  You’ll also f ind in our Learning Guide a discussion of “phone etiquette,” that is, common practices in talking on the telephone in the United States.  That’s also in our Le arning Guide.

Candace says that she’s “fielding calls (or fielding phone  calls) for the person doing the hiring.”  Someone who “hires” is someone wh o selects the person to work in a new job.  So, you apply to a company for a job , someone in the company has to make the final decision to hire you – to em ploy you, to give you the job.

“What can I do for you?” Candace asks.  Mehdi says, “Well, I read the job description and I think I would be a good fit.”  The “ job description” is usually a short written document that has information – specific in formation about the job, including what you will have to do and what the qualif ications are.  That is, what you need in terms of education and experience in order to get the job.  That’s the job description.  The job description for my job as host of ESL Podcast would be to be very good looking and to be a good singer – fort unately I am very qualified for that!  Mehdi says he thinks he’ll be a “good fit” for the job, meaning that the job will be similar to his own experience and his own ed ucation; he will be able to do everything the job needs him to do.  So, it’s a good  match – it’s a good fit between the job and Mehdi.

Mehdi says, “I was wondering if there are any special qual ifications (thing that he will need to be able to do) not mentioned in the jo b description.”  Candace says, “Well, requirements are spelled out in the description .”  Here, to “spell out” means to provide detailed information, to include all of the details.  The job description spells out all the things that you need to do in order to get paid.  To

 “spell out” means to give details.  It actually has a coupl e of different meanings; take a look, once again, at our Learning Guide for some  additional explanations of this expression, to “spell out.”

Candace says, “I don’t have much to add (meaning I don’t have any additional information I can give you about this).  But I do know t hat the person doing the hiring is looking for someone to start immediately.”  I n other words, they want someone who can begin work immediately, who doesn’t need  a week or two weeks before they can begin working.  “Can you do that? ” Candace asks, and Mehdi says, “Sure, that’s no problem.  I’ll be sure to mention that in my cover letter” – I will talk about that in my cover letter.  A “cover letter” is a, usually, one page letter that you send along with, perhaps, your rés umé or CV, the listing of all your jobs, experience, and education.  It’s something  you send when you are applying for a job.  So, it’s a letter that gives a summ ary of your qualifications; it gives the person a chance to get to know you a little bett er.  That’s a cover letter.

Candace said, “If you’ve had experience managing a large staff, be sure to emphasize that in your résumé.”  A “staff” is a group of employees; your employees can be called your “staff.”  To “emphasize” mea ns to say or write something in a way that makes it seem important, or mor e important.  Your résumé, or your CV (or curriculum vitae), is usually a one  or two – but could be much longer – page document that describes all of your e ducation, your work experience, your skills, perhaps any honors or awards that yo u’ve received; all this would be part of your résumé or CV.

Mehdi says he doesn’t have any other questions, and thanks C andace for her time.  Candace says, “Your questions show a lot of initiat ive.  I’m sure you’ll do fine.”  “Initiative” is the willingness and ability to d o something without someone else asking you to do it first.  So, you see something th at needs to be done at your job, you just go do it.  You don’t wait until som eone tells you or asks you to do something; you do it on your own initiative.  So, “sh owing initiative” is to demonstrate that you are willing to go and do somethin g without being asked first.

Mehdi thanks Candace and says, “I really appreciate the vo te of confidence.” Here, “vote of confidence” means support, the belief tha t you can do something – the belief that you are able to do something well.  S omeone says to you, “I’m sure that you will do this job very well,” they are giving  you a vote of confidence; they are saying yes, I support you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Candace:  Hello.

Mehdi:  Hello, may I speak to Candace Cho, please?

Candace:  Speaking.

Mehdi:  Oh, hello Ms. Cho.  My name is Mehdi and I’m i nterested in applying for the job as assistant manager.  Your name was listed as the  contact person.  Am I calling at a bad time?

# Describing a Musical Performance

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast  number 409: Describing a Musical Performance.

This episode is called “Describing a Musical Performance.”  It’s a dialogue between Janine and Calvin about a musical “performance,”  when yo u go to listen to someone who is playing an instrument or singing.  The y’re going to use a lot of vocabulary we might use to describe music and someone perfor ming music.  The dialogue is actually between two people who are selectin g, or deciding, who is going to be a member of the musical group that they are in charge of.  So, they’re going to listen to people playing music and then decide if this person is good enough to be part of their group.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Janine:  Okay, we need to find one more act for this year ’s show.  How many more people are waiting to audition?

Calvin:  There are two more.  Should I call in the fi rst one?

Janine:  Yup.  Let’s get this over with. ...

Calvin:  What did you think of that performance?

Janine:  I thought she was flawless.  She plays with a l ot of passion.

Calvin:  Yeah, that’s true, but I wouldn’t call her a virtuoso.  The piece she played was pretty rudimentary.

Janine:  True enough, but I still think she’s a winner.

Calvin:  Let’s hear the next one. ...

Janine:  He certainly played with a lot of flair.

Calvin:  He has amazing chops, I think.  I haven’t seen an yone play with such artistry in a long time.

Janine:  Nobody can fault him on mastery of the music, bu t don’t you think he lacked originality and expressiveness?

Calvin:  No, I don’t.  I think he’s a winner.

Janine:  It’s clear that it’s a stalemate.  I want the f irst performer and you want the second.  What should we do?

Calvin:  I think we should duke  it out and the winner gets his or her choice.

Janine:  I have a better idea.  We add them both to t he bill.

Calvin:  That’s brilliant!  That’s why they pay you the big bucks.

Janine:  I would be flattered if we weren’t all volu nteers!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Janine saying, “Okay, we need to  find one more act for this year’s show.”  They’re looking for one person or one group that can perform in a show with other musical groups, so there’s actually mo re than one group in this performance –  this show.  She says, “How many more people are waiting  to audition?”  To “audition” means to sing, or play a musi cal instrument, act, or dance for a short period of time so that someone can see and listen and decide if you are good enough to be part of this performance.  S o for example here in Los Angeles, in Hollywood, people go on auditions – and that’s the expression we use, “to go on an audition.”  They go on an audition to be part of a movie or to be part of a television series and it’s usual ly quite short; it’s usually a minute, two minutes, maybe five or 10 minutes, not a long time.  If  you’re interested in this topic be sure to listen to English Café number 132, whe re we interview an actor here in Los Angeles.

So, Janine is asking how many  people are waiting to audition.  Calvin says, “There are two more.  Should I call in the first one? ” – should I tell the first person

These materials are copyrighted by the Center f or Educational Development (2008).  Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any wa y is prohibited. 7 to come in now?  Janine says, “Yup” (yup), which is a short,  informal way of saying yes.  She says, “Let’s get this over with.”  To “get something over with” means to do something as fast as you can, often because it isn’t very pleasant. You’re trying to get something done that you really do n’t want to do.

So, they listen to the musical performance and then they talk about  it.  Of course, we don’t actually get to hear the musical performance.  Calvin says, “What did you think of that performance?” –  what was your opinion?  Janine says, “I thought she was flawless” (flawless).  To be “flawless” means to be perfect.  A “flaw”  is an error or a mistake, so to be “flawless” means to have no mistakes, no errors.  Janine says, “She plays with a lot of passion.”  “ Passion,” here, means enthusiasm, a very strong love of something, someone who really loves it and is enthusiastic about  it.

Calvin says, “Yeah (meaning yes), that’s true, but I would n’t call her a virtuoso.” A “virtuoso” is a very good musician who plays very, very well.   Yo-Yo Ma is a famous American virtuoso on the cello.  Calvin says, “The pi ece she played was pretty rudimentary.”  “Rudimentary” means basic and simple, not very advanced or difficult.  Janine says, “True enough (meaning yes, th at’s true, I agree), but I still think she’s a winner.”  Calvin says, “Let’s hear the n ext one,” and of course, then they listen  to the next performance.  Afterwards, they come back and talk about it.

Calvin says, “Well?” meaning what is your opinion.  Janine  says, “He certainly played with a lot of flair.”  “Flair” (flair), here,  means with a lot of style, in a very interesting , perhaps unusual, way.  “He has a lot of flair” – he does things in interesting and unusual ways.  Calvin says, “He has amazing ch ops, I think.” “Chops” (chops), here, means ability or skill to do someth ing.  It’s often used to describe someone who is ve ry good at music, but it could be used for anything. You could say, “He has great cooking chops,” meaning he ha s a lot of ability or skill or talent to do that thing.  “Chop” has a number  of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide  for some additional explanations.

Calvin says, “I haven’t seen anyone play with such artistry in a long time.” “Artistry” means with a lot of talent –  a lot of artistic talent, someone who has a lot of skills in music, for example, or singing, or acting, some thing in what we would call “the arts.”  He has a lot of artistry.

Janine doesn’t really agree.  She says, “Nobody can fault him on mastery of the music.”  To “fault” someone means to say that someone did something wrong, to say that this person is not very good at something.  You may say, “I won’t fault you for not knowing how to type” –  I won’t blame you, I won’t say you did

These materials are copyrighted by the Center f or Educational Development (2008).  Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any wa y is prohibited. 8 something wrong.  She says no one “can fault him on maste ry of the music.” “Mastery” (mastery) means expertise, having a ful l or complete knowledge of something or ability to do something.  It’s another way of saying to be very good at something.

Janine says, “don’t you think he lacked originality and expre ssiveness?”  She doesn’t think that this performer was very original.   “He “lacked (or didn’t have) originality,” meaning he wasn’t different, he wasn’t u nique, he didn’t do something that no one else has done before.  “Expressivene ss” is a word we would use to describe someone who has an ability to show yo u how they feel o r think, usually through their art – through their music, their singing, their dance, their acting.  Someone who is very expressive shows their emo tions; you can feel what they are feeling.

Calvin says, “No.  I think he’s a winner.”  Janine says, “It’ s cl ear that it’s a stalemate.”  When you have a “stalemate” (stalemate – one word) you have a situation where neither person can win.  It’s often use d to describe a situation where two people cannot agree: “We’re at a stalemate, ” or “We have a stalemate.”

Janine says, “I want the first performer and you want the  second.  What should we do?”  So they don’t agree on which person should b e the final act – the final performer in this show that they are putting on – that they are putting together, organizing.  C alvin says, “I think we should duke it out and the winner gets his or her choice.”  He’s joking here, because to “duke something out” means to fight someone in order to decide an argument.  To actually hi t them, that sort of fighting: “to duke it out.”  “The two boxers duked it out” – they fought each other.

Well, of course, Calvin is just joking –  we hope!  Janine says, “I have a better idea.  We add them both to the bill.”  “Bill,” here , means a written list of who will be performing in a play or at a co ncert.  “Bill” has many different meanings in English, but this one means a list of those who will be performing at a certain concert or play.

Calvin says, “That’s brilliant (that’s a great idea)!  Th at’s why they pay you the big bucks.”  When someone says, “They pay him the big bucks,” they  mean they pay him a lot of money.  A “buck” is another word for a d ollar, “bucks” (plural) means money in general, and “big bucks” means a lot of money.

Janine says, “I would be flattered if we weren’t all vol unteers!”  To “be flattered” means to be happy that someone said something nice about  you, to be happy that someone likes you or what you have done.  A beautifu l woman comes up to

Janine says, “I would be flattered if we weren’t all volunteers,” meaning we don’t get paid for this, if w e did get paid for this, then I would be – conditional –  I would be flattered.  But of course, they don’t get paid anything.

Now l et’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal spee d.

# Being Evasive

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 10: Being Evasive.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 410.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  When you go there, you  can download a Learning Guide that will help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Being Evasive.”  Someone who is “eva sive” doesn’t tell you the truth; gives you the half truth, but not the w hole truth.  It’s a dialogue between a daughter and her father, and the father h as difficulty answering the questions of his daughter.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Olivia:  Dad, can I ask you a question?

Dad:  You just did.

Olivia:  I mean, can I ask you another question?

Dad:  Ask away.

Olivia:  Where do babies come from?

Dad:  What?  Where did you come up with that one?

Olivia:  I don’t know.

Dad:  Let me tell you.  That’s for grown-ups to know.  You’re just a pipsqueak. You mind your own business and I’ll tell you when you’re a little older.

Olivia:  Why can’t you tell me now?

Dad:  No comment.

Olivia:  Dad, what does no comment mean?

 Dad:  That’s confidential.

Olivia:  Why is it confidential?

Dad:  That’s personal.

Olivia:  Dad, just tell me.

Dad:  Never you mind.

Olivia:  But I want to know!

Dad:  And I want to know why I can’t get some peace and  quiet in this house.

Olivia:  Oh, Dad.

Dad:  Don’t “oh, Dad” me.  Just wait and see.  You’ll get all the answers you want when you’re older.

Olivia:  But Dad, I want to know now.  Where do babie s come from?

Dad:  I’m out of answers.  Go ask your mother.

Olivia:  I did.  Mom said to ask you.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Olivia saying, “Dad, can I ask you  a question?” and Dad says, trying to be funny, “You just did,” meaning if you a sk someone if you can ask a question, of course, you’re asking a question already.   So, Dad’s a funny guy.  Olivia says, “I mean, can I ask another question?” – a n additional question. Dad says, “Ask away.”  This is a phrase, “ask away,” that we use  to invite someone to ask whatever questions he or she wants to ask.  I t’s saying you can ask me anything: “ask away.”  So Olivia says, “Where do babie s come from?” This, of course, is one of those questions that children ask their parents at some point, at some age.  Parents often have a difficult tim e explaining this for reasons you probably understand.

Dad says, “What?  Where did you come up with that one?”  Dad is a little surprised; he says, “Where did you come up with that one.”   To “come up with” something means to think of something, to have an idea.  You might even say,

 “I’ve come up with a plan to save the environment” – I’ve  thought of, I have created in my mind.

So, Dad is asking where she came up with this question – h ow did she think of this.  Olivia says, “I don’t know.”  Dad says, trying to exp lain it to her, “Let me tell you.”  This is a phrase you use if you are an expert, if yo u know a lot about a subject or a topic.  It tells the other person I know wha t I’m talking about: “Well, let me tell you.”  Sometimes people use that to empha size the point they are about to make.

Dad says, “That’s for grown-ups to know,” meaning the an swer to your question is not for children but for adults.  “Grown-up” is a noun referring to someone usually over the age of 18, maybe 21.  Dad says, “You’re j ust a pipsqueak.”  This is an interesting word; “pipsqueak” (pipsqueak) is an  informal term for someone who is small or not very important.  We often use this for a young child.  It’s usually a negative term to describe a young child.

Dad says, “You mind your own business and I’ll tell you whe n you’re a little older.”  To “mind your own business” means to pay atten tion to things that are part of your own life – your own experience, not to wo rry about other people or other things that you don’t need to know about.  So, D ad is saying you don’t need to know the answer to that question.  “Mind your own bu siness” is somewhat of a negative expression as well.  It’s saying I’m not going to answer your question; it’s none of your business; it’s not anything that concerns you; you don’t have a right to know the answer.

Olivia says, “Why can’t you tell me now?”  Dad responds by sa ying, “No comment.”  Usually, this is an expression you’ll hear a po litician or a famous person say when a reporter or a journalist from a newsp aper or a television station asks a question.  When the person doesn’t want to give an answer, they’ll simply say, “No, comment.”  Dad is being, again, a littl e funny here, because it’s his own daughter who’s asking the question.  “Comment” has several different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that word.

Olivia says, “Dad, what does no comment mean?”  She doesn ’t really understand the expression; it’s something you see in the news mostly.  Dad says, “That’s confidential.”  Remember, Dad is being “evasive,” meani ng he’s trying not to answer the question, or only answer part of the question .  Usually, this is a sign of someone who is trying to hide something, or perhaps so meone who is dishonest – not honest.  So Dad says the answer is confiden tial.  Again, he’s

 trying to be funny a little bit.  Something that is “confidential” is information that you do not give or share with other people; it’s secret information.

Olivia then asks, “Why is it confidential?” and Dad answers,  “That’s personal.” Here, when you say something is “personal,” you mean it’s only for one specific or single person, not something for everyone.  People ma y talk about their “personal lives,” meaning their life outside of work, ou tside of the public view, things that no one else needs to know about.  Again, D ad, always the joker, says “That’s personal,” meaning it’s just for me to know.  “ Personal” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations of that word.

Dad then hears Olivia say something that you would hear from someone who really wants to know something, especially a child.  Olivia  says, “Dad, just tell me.”  “Just tell me” – please tell me.  Dad says, “Never you mind.”  This means you don’t need to know something, and you should stop aski ng me about it.  It’s a bit old-fashioned; it’s a bit of an older expression : “Never you mind.”  It does not mean exactly the same thing as “never mind.”  “Never mind ” means it’s not important, don’t worry about it.  For example, when yo u are asking someone a question and they can’t understand your question, after  a few minutes you may say, “Oh, never mind.  It’s not important.”  “Never you m ind” means you should stop asking me this question.

Olivia says, “But I want to know!”  Dad responds by saying, “ And I want to know why I can’t get some peace and quiet in this house.”  The  expression “peace and quiet” means a time and a place where everything is calm .  “Peace” means no fighting, no shouting, no loud noises.  “Quiet” means p retty much the same thing; the opposite of loud is quiet.

Olivia then says, “Oh, Dad,” which is something a child wo uld say when they are frustrated, when they don’t like what is happening: “Oh , Dad.”  In this case, she’s mad at her father, or disappointed.  Her father respo nds, “Don’t ‘oh, Dad’ me. Just wait and see.”  The expression “don’t (something) me ” is a phrase we use to show that you are not happy with what the other person  said.  It’s a phrase to show your frustration or irritation at someone.  So Ol ivia says, “Oh, Dad,” and Dad responds, “Don’t ‘oh, Dad’ me,” meaning don’t say t hat to me, don’t say that expression “oh, Dad.”

Dad says, “Just wait and see,” meaning wait and see what will happen in the future.  Dad says, “You’ll get all the answers you want when you’re older.”  Olivia says, “But Dad, I want to know now.  Where do babies com e from?” – where do we get babies?  Dad says, “I’m out of answers.  When you  say you are “out of”

 something, you mean you don’t have any more of that thin g.  So Dad is saying I don’t have any more answers: “I’m out of answers,” and t hen he says what all good parents say, in this case fathers, “Go ask your mothe r.”  When you don’t want to deal with what your child is asking you, you send t hem to the other parent.

Olivia said, “I did (meaning I did ask Mom).  Mom said t o ask you.”  Of course, the parents are sending the child back and forth because neither wants to answer the question.

We won’t answer the question here.  If you don’t know w here babies come from, just wait and see!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Olivia:  Dad, can I ask you a question?

Dad:  You just did.

Olivia:  I mean, can I ask you another question?

Dad:  Ask away.

Olivia:  Where do babies come from?

Dad:  What?  Where did you come up with that one?

Olivia:  I don’t know.

Dad:  Let me tell you.  That’s for grown-ups to know.  You’re just a pipsqueak. You mind your own business and I’ll tell you when you’re a little older.

Olivia:  Why can’t you tell me now?

Dad:  No comment.

Olivia:  Dad, what does no comment mean?

Dad:  That’s confidential.

 Olivia:  Why is it confidential?

Dad:  That’s personal.

Olivia:  Dad, just tell me.

Dad:  Never you mind.

Olivia:  But I want to know!

Dad:  And I want to know why I can’t get some peace and  quiet in this house.

Olivia:  Oh, Dad.

Dad:  Don’t “oh, Dad” me.  Just wait and see.  You’ll get all the answers you want when you’re older.

Olivia:  But Dad, I want to know now.  Where do babie s come from?

Dad:  I’m out of answers.  Go ask your mother.

Olivia:  I did.  Mom said to ask you.

# Eating Junk Food

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 11: Eating Junk Food.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 411.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  When you go there, you  can download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, new sample sentences using the vocabulary, additional expl anations of words we use on this episode that are not explained on the audio  file, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a complete transcript of eve rything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Eating Junk Food.”  It’s a dialog ue between Frank and Katie about eating food that isn’t necessarily very good  for your health but tastes good.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Frank:  Hand me that bag of potato chips.

Katie:  Here.  You mean you’re still hungry after two  burgers and French fries?

Frank:  Yeah, I am.  I’m a growing boy.  Where’s the p opcorn?

Katie:  I can’t believe we’re eating all of this junk f ood.  I’m supposed to be watching what I eat.

Frank:  Forget about it.  Who can watch a football gam e without stuffing their faces?  It’s an American tradition.

Katie:  Where did you get those candy bars?

Frank:  Some kids were selling them door-to-door and I thought it was my duty to buy some.

Katie:  It was your duty to buy 10 candy bars?!

Frank:  What can I say?  I’m a softy.

 Katie:  I’m getting another soda.  Do you want one?

Frank:  No, thanks.  But while you’re up, can you hand m e the phone?

Katie:  Sure, why?

Frank:  I’m ordering a pizza.

[end of dialogue]

We begin with Frank saying to Katie, “Hand me that ba g of potato chips.”  To “hand” someone something means to give something to some one, to pass something to someone.  “Hand me” is a command form; it’ s a little informal.  If you were being a little more polite, you would say, “p lease give me,” or “could you please hand me.”  If you’re sitting at a dinner tab le, you may say, “Hand me the salt” to your husband or child.  The word “hand” h as many different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that term.

Frank says, “Hand me that bag of potato chips.”  Potato chips is an example of “junk food,” food that is not healthy.  “Junk” is another  word for trash, something you would throw away.  Junk food describes food that is b ad for you, often cheap food.  “Potato chips” are made from very thin slices of a  potato that are fried in oil; you put them in hot oil and you get potato chips.  You put salt on them.  In British English, potato chips are called “crisps,” and “chip s” means something different in British English.  But in American English,  “potato chips” is the term we use for this particular kind of junk food.

Katie says, “Here.”  That’s what you might say to someone when you are giving something to someone who is right next to you or in fron t of you.  “Here,” meaning here it is.  Then she says, “You mean you’re stil l hungry after (eating) two burgers and French fries?”  A “burger” is a hamburg er.  It’s a sandwich made by cooking ground beef (from a cow) and putting it in b etween two pieces of bread, usually adding mustard, ketchup, perhaps lettuce a nd tomatoes, onions, other things.  McDonald’s is the largest restaurant that  makes hamburgers – that sells hamburgers.  They are famous for their hamburgers.   “French fries” are a snack that is made by frying long pieces of potato in oil  and then adding salt. Once again, you can usually buy French fries at a place that  sells hamburgers.

So, Katie is wondering how Frank can still be hungry af ter eating so much food. Frank says, “Yeah, I am” – yes, I am still hungry.  Then h e jokes, “I’m a growing

 boy.”  When we say someone is a “growing boy,” or a “grow ing girl,” we mean that they need a lot of energy – they need a lot of fo od.  So, he’s giving this as an excuse.  Then he says, “Where’s the popcorn?”  “Popcorn” is a  snack, something you would eat at, for example the movie theater, where  you take small pieces of corn – dry corn – and you put them over heat until they o pen – until they burst open or explode, and you end up with these little whi te pieces of corn that you can then put butter and salt on.

Katie then says, “I can’t believe we’re eating all of th is junk food.  I’m supposed to be watching what I eat.”  To “watch what you eat” is a n expression that means to try to eat better foods, usually so you can lose weight (if  you have too much weight) or become healthier.  I need to watch what I eat – that’s for sure!

Frank says, “Forget about it (meaning don’t worry about  it).  Who can watch a football game without stuffing their faces?”  So, Fran k and Katie are watching an American football game, which usually takes place on Sund ay afternoon.  And it is a common tradition to watch the game on television at  home and eat junk food, and have snacks while you are watching it.  To “stuff your face” means to eat a lot of something very quickly.  It’s an informal expression: to “stuff (stuff) your face.”  Frank says, “It’s an American tradition.”  It’s so mething that all Americans do on a regular basis – stuff their faces during a foot ball game!

Katie then asks Frank, “Where did you get those candy bars?”   A “candy bar” is a small, usually “rectangular” (long and narrow) food tha t has nuts, chocolate, perhaps something else on it or in it.  There are man y famous kinds of candy bars; they’re very popular with children.  You can buy the m in most stores.  They are made with a lot of sugar, typically.

Frank says, “Some kids were selling them door-to-door and  I thought it was my duty to buy some.”  So, where did he buy the candy bars?   Well, normally you would buy them in a store, but there are many youth g roups and schools that try to “raise money,” meaning they try to get money for the ir school or their organization by selling things.  And they go to your hous e, they knock on your door, and they try to sell you these things.  This is very common; it happens to me in my house maybe two or three times a week.  To go “ door-to-door” means to go from house to house, or from business to business, kno cking on each door, asking to speak to the person so you can sell them somethin g.

Frank says he thought it was his duty to buy some.  Your “duty” is something that you are supposed to do, you must do, you need to do.  We  talk about voting in a democracy being your civic duty, “civic” meaning, in this case , what you owe the rest of society – what you owe your country.  So, a duty is something you are

 supposed to do.  Of course, Frank is joking here.  He doesn ’t have a duty to buy candy, but he says he does, probably because he was trying to  help this school or organization.

Katie says, “It was your duty to buy 10 candy bars?!”  Frank says, “What can I say?”  This expression is used when you don’t have a good answ er for what the person is asking you.  “Well, what can I say?” – I have no  excuse.  He says, “I’m a softy” (softy).  A “softy” is someone who has difficulty sayi ng no, someone who does whatever people ask him or her to do.

Katie says, “I’m getting another soda.  Do you want one? ”  “Soda,” sometimes called “soda pop” or, in Minnesota and in some of the Midwestern states, it’s just called “pop.”  It all refers a sweet drink that usually has small bubbles in it; we say it’s “carbonated.”  Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola – these are all examples of sodas, or as we say back in Minnesota, pop.

Frank says, “No, thanks (he does not want another soda).  But while you’re up,” meaning since you are already standing up and going int o the kitchen – “while you’re up, can you hand me the phone?”  Katie says, “Sure , why?”  Frank says, “I’m ordering a pizza.”  “Pizza” is a very typically Italian  food, made with a large, in the United States usually round, piece of bread that  you put tomato sauce, cheese, perhaps different kinds of meat on top of, and t hen you bake it in an oven.  Pizza is a very popular type of snack food, especially w hen you are watching a game – a sporting event like a football game .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Frank:  Hand me that bag of potato chips.

Katie:  Here.  You mean you’re still hungry after two  burgers and French fries?

Frank:  Yeah, I am.  I’m a growing boy.  Where’s the p opcorn?

Katie:  I can’t believe we’re eating all of this junk f ood.  I’m supposed to be watching what I eat.

Frank:  Forget about it.  Who can watch a football gam e without stuffing their faces?  It’s an American tradition.

# Corporate Spying

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 12: Corporate Spying.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 412.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can go there and downloa d a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8 to 10 page guide that gives you all of the vocabulary, definitions, new sample sentences, additional definiti ons not found in this audio podcast, cultural notes, comprehension checks, and a complete  transcript of everything that you hear.

This episode is a dialogue between Joachim and Dawn.  Th ey’re going to be talking about spying, trying to get secret information f rom another company, and in the process they’ll use a lot of different vocabulary to talk about spying and corporate secrets.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Joachim:  I’m really having second thoughts about hiring a  firm to do corporate spying for us.  I don’t want to do anything that’s ethica lly questionable.

Dawn:  We have no choice but to do it.  All of our comp etitors conduct corporate espionage.

Joachim:  I can understand spying on our competitors, but I draw the line at having us snoop on our own employees.

Dawn:  We wouldn’t unless our backs were against the wall .  I know you’re thinking about Hewer Placket hiring investigators to find  a leak in their company. I’m sure it was a hard decision for them, but they couldn ’t allow anyone in their own company to leak trade secrets.

Joachim:  True, it was necessary, but I don’t like being d eceptive with our own employees.  I won’t allow wiretaps or any invasion of pri vacy.

Dawn:  Our first priority would be damage control, no t privacy.  In any case, we’re not making a decision to spy within the company right now.   We’re only after our rival’s information.  The investigators we’re hiring kno w the difference between

 legal and illegal spying.  They’ll schmooze at trade show s, scour legal records, and do other things like that.  They’ll know where to d raw the line.

Joachim:  I hope you’re right.  I don’t want to end up  on the front page of the Times!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Joachim saying, “I’m really havin g second thoughts about hiring a firm to do corporate spying for us.”  Wh en someone says they have “second thoughts” about something, they mean that th ey feel like, perhaps, they made the wrong decision, that they need to change t heir mind about something.  You are reconsidering an issue.  Joachim is havi ng second thoughts about hiring (paying) a company (a firm) to do corporat e spying for them. “Corporate spying” is trying to find out as much as you can  about another company, including information that may not be publicly a vailable.  Joachim says, “I don’t want to do anything that’s ethically questionab le.”  When we talk about something being “ethical,” or the adverb “ethically,” w e mean right or wrong, good or bad, moral or immoral.  Lying, according to most peo ple, is ethically wrong.  Or we might just say it’s “unethical.”  When someone says its “ unethical,” they mean it’s not ethical – it’s not right.  Joachim says it’s “ethica lly questionable.” Something that is “questionable” is problematic; it is so mething that may be right but may not be right, it may not be very clear.

Dawn says, “We have no choice but to do it (we have to do  it).  All of our competitors (the people who have similar companies) cond uct corporate espionage.”  “Espionage” (espionage) is just another wor d for spying, to send somebody to find out secret information about another organization, another person, and, of course, another country.

Joachim says, “I can understand spying on our competitors, bu t I draw the line at having us snoop on our own employees.”  The expression “to draw the line at something” means that this is the last thing you are will ing to do; the most extreme thing you are willing to do.  So you may do a l ot of different things, each one moving more and more towards a point where you don ’t want to do any more.  For example, someone may cheat on an exam in a te acher’s class, and the teacher says, “Okay, I’m going to forgive you.”  Then the student cheats again and the teacher says, “I’ll forgive you this time, but I’m going to draw the line at two times that you cheat.  After that, I won’ t forgive you.”  So, that’s to draw the line at something.

 Joachim draws the line at snooping on his own employees.  To “snoop” (snoop) means to spy; it means the same thing as spying on someon e, getting secret information from them.  Sometimes we use the word “s noop” to refer to something that isn’t quite as serious as spying; trying to find out information about another person, but it’s not exactly trying to ge t secret information about them.  So, “snoop” is often used as a more informal, pe rhaps less serious kind of spying.

Dawn says, “We wouldn’t (meaning we would not snoop on our own employees) unless our backs were against the wall.”  The expression “t o have your back against the wall” means that you do not have any other o ptions; you have only one thing that you can do; you are desperate.  “Our ba cks are against the wall” – we have to do this, we have no other choice.  Dawn says, “I  know you’re thinking about Hewer Placket hiring investigators to find a leak i n their company.”  Dawn is talking about another company called Hewer Placket, wh ich of course is not a real company – although it does sound a lot like a famo us computer company that was spying on its own employees and finding informa tion about them.  But, that’s just a coincidence!

This other company, then, had hired investigators to find  a leak (leak).  A “leak” is someone who is giving secret information to people outsi de of your organization or company; it’s allowing secret information to somehow end up in the hands of another person outside of your organization.  This is a problem in government, when the government tries to keep secret information a nd then somebody takes that from inside the government and gives it, for examp le, to a newspaper.  That would be called a “leak.”  The word “leak” has a coupl e of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

So, Dawn is saying yes, I know you’re thinking about that o ther company, “I’m sure it was a hard decision for them, but they couldn’t a llow anyone in their company to leak trade secrets.”  “Trade secrets” refers to se cret information about how you do your business – how you conduct your busi ness.  Trade secrets would be anything that a company doesn’t want othe r people to know. For example, Coca-Cola doesn’t want anyone to know its r ecipe, how it makes its soda; that would be a trade secret.

Joachim says, “True, it was necessary (for this other company to  snoop on their own employees), but I don’t like being deceptive with ou r own employees.”  To be “deceptive” means to lie, to not tell the truth.  S o, Joachim doesn’t want to lie to his own employees.  He says, “I won’t allow wiretaps or  any invasion of privacy.”  “Wiretaps” (wiretaps) is when someone listens sec retly to your conversation, either on the telephone or in a building  somewhere; they’re

 listening and usually recording your conversation withou t your knowledge.  This is something that the government in many countries, includ ing this country, has done with its own citizens to get information about the m.  This is a very controversial issue in the United States, wiretapping Ame rican citizens or others to get to get information usually for reasons of nation al security – or at least that’s the official reason!  An “invasion of privacy” is when some one violates your right to keep your personal information secret.  “Privacy” refer s to a situation where no one can see you or observe you, or know about what you are  doing.  An “invasion” is normally when one country goes into another country using military force, an army or a navy for example.  Here, “invasion of  privacy,” however, means that your privacy has not been kept; someone has been  observing you without your permission.

Dawn says, “Our first priority (our first thing that we n eed to do – the most important thing) would be damage control, not privacy.”   “Damage control” is when you try to make a bad situation look better than it  is, to make it as good as you can.  So something goes wrong and your company, for exa mple, makes a product that doesn’t work.  Well, you want to do damag e control; you want to make sure the problem is not any worse or gets any worse, perhaps by refunding the money to all of your customers.

Dawn says, “In any case, we’re not making a decision to spy wi thin the company right now (inside the company).  We’re only after our r ival’s information.”  “Rival” is another word for a competitor, a person or a compan y that you are competing against that, perhaps, sells the same kind of thing as you  do.  Dawn says, “The investigators we’re hiring know the difference between l egal and illegal spying. They’ll schmooze at trade shows, scour legal records, and do  other things like that.”  To “schmooze” (schmooze) means to have a casual, i nformal conversation with other people, usually so that you can get to know m ore important people so that you can make contacts.  Another verb we use here would  be to “network,” to meet other people in your particular industry, your part icular field, in order to find more information or perhaps to get a better job; the re are a lot of reasons why someone might schmooze.  To “scour” (scour) means to look th rough many things trying to find a very specific piece of information .  “Scour” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Dawn says these investigators “know where to draw the line .”  Joachim says, “I hope you’re right.  I don’t want to end up on the fr ont page of the Times!” – I don’t want, at the end of this situation, for my name or pict ure to be on the front page of the newspaper, The New York Times .  Usually in the U.S., when someone refers to the Times, they’re usually talking about the la rgest, or one of the largest

 national newspapers, The New York Times .  There are, however, many newspapers call the Times, including here in Los Angeles,  The Los Angeles Times .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Joachim:  I’m really having second thoughts about hiring a  firm to do corporate spying for us.  I don’t want to do anything that’s ethica lly questionable.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, which will help you improve through your English  even faster.

This episode is called “Talking About Intelligence.”  It’ s a dialogue between Andre and Josephine, where they’re talking about how smart, or  how intelligent, certain people are, and they’ll use a lot of vocabulary related  to smart or not so smart people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Andre:  Mom, I can’t believe I got stuck with Matt as my l ab partner in school.

Josephine:  Matt?  Do I know Matt?

Andre:  He lives down the street.  He’s Mr. and Mrs. Ke mp’s son.  He’s a total airhead.

Josephine:  Oh, I remember him.  He was at your birth day party.

Andre:  Yeah, when I was nine years old!  That guy is so dense!

Josephine:  Matt was always considered a gifted child.  He seemed bright and perceptive, and his parents thought he’d go far.

Andre:  If you ask me, he’s not all there.  Every time I look over at him in class, he’s staring off into space.  He doesn’t seem like the kind  who’s very quick on the uptake.

Josephine:  You know, some very smart people can seem spacey t o the rest of us.  Maybe he’s just thinking when he stares off into space.

Andre:  Maybe.  All I know is that my science grade is rid ing on how we do in the lab, so I hope he shapes up.

 Josephine:  I’m sure he will.  And even if he doesn’t, you’re clever enough to still do well in the class.

Andre:  Thanks, Mom, but I wouldn’t bet on it!

Our dialogue begins with Andre, who’s talking to his mo ther, saying, “Mom, I can’t believe I got stuck with Matt as my lab partner in sch ool.”  The expression “to be stuck with” is a phrasal verb meaning that you are forced to, or have to do something that you don’t want to do or don’t like doin g.  Sometimes this happens because you, perhaps, were late or someone else didn’t do  their work and they gave it to you to do, then you are stuck with it; you have to do it even though you don’t like it.

Well, Andre is stuck with a lab partner at school and he doesn’t like him.  A “lab partner” is someone in school who works with you in a labo ratory, usually as part of a science class.  In most science classes, or many science classes, y ou have two, three, or even four people – students – working on  the same project; those are your lab partners.  Often the teacher will assign stu dents to their lab partners; they don’t give them a choice.  I remember when I was t aken biology in high school I had a lab partner I didn’t particularly like, b ut that’s just the way it goes.

Josephine says, “Matt?  Do I know Matt?”  Matt is the name  of his new lab partner.  Andre says, “He lives down the street (meaning he lives close to our house).  He’s Mr. and Mrs. Kemp’s son.  He’s a total air head.”  When you call someone an “airhead” (airhead – one word), you’re sayi ng that person is stupid, that person is not smart, that person is dumb.  This is a n informal expression, of course.  If you call someone an “airhead” you’re saying tha t they’re not very smart, or you’re saying that they get confused easily or th ey don’t remember things very well.  Those are also possibilities for someone  who is called an “airhead.”

Josephine says, “Oh, I remember him.  He was at your birth day party.”  Andre says, “Yeah, when I was nine years old!”  Meaning that wa s a long time ago; he’s obviously 15 or 16 now so nine years old seems like a long t ime ago.  Andre says, “That guy is so dense!”  To be “dense” (dense) is ano ther word, again, for stupid, dumb, not very intelligent, not able to underst and things very easily. Again, it’s an insulting term; it’s not a nice to say ab out someone, that they’re dense.  It’s often used to describe people who you try to  talk to and explain things to but they don’t quite understand.

 The mother, Josephine, says, “Matt was always considered a gi fted child.”  In the school system in the United States, if you say is someone is “ gifted,” you mean they are supposed to have special intelligence or special t alents.  They’re supposed to be very smart, and in many schools there are speci al programs that are set up for these supposedly smarter children.  Unfort unately in many cases, all of the parents think that their children are gifte d, and so it sometimes doesn’t really mean anything.  My parents never thought I was gif ted, and they were right!

Josephine says, “He seemed bright and perceptive.”  To be “ perceptive” means you are able to understand things quickly, so it’s sort of  the opposite of being dense.  Josephine says Matt’s parents thought he’d go far .  To “go far,” in this case, means to do well in life, to succeed, to do great t hings.  My teacher said, “Jeff, you will go far.”  Not all predictions come true!

Andre, however, disagrees.  He says, “If you ask me (if you are asking my opinion), he’s not all there.”  When you say someone is “not all there,” you mean that they seem to be thinking about something else all the time; they never seem to be focused on the present or current situation.  The y’re distracted; they’re thinking about other things: “he’s not all there.”  Th at may be something that happens all the time, or it may be something that happ ens every once in a while. But here, Andre is saying that Matt is like this all the time.  “Every time I look over at him in class,” Andre says, “he’s staring off into space.”  To “stare” (stare) means to look at something, usually to look at it for a ve ry long time.  To “stare off into space,” however, means to have your eyes open, bu t you’re not really looking at anything in particular because you’re thinking .  You’re thinking a lot, and your eyes are just sort of pointed in a certain direct ion.  You’re staring off into space – you’re thinking about something else and not payin g attention to what is happening around you.

Andre says Matt doesn’t seem like the kind who’s very quick on  the uptake.  To describe someone as “quick on the uptake” means they’re a f ast learner; they understand things very quickly.  Josephine says, “You know, some very smart people can seem spacey to the rest of us.”  Some very sma rt, intelligent people can seem spacey.  To be “spacey” is to be someone who stares  off into space, who’s a bit of an airhead, who doesn’t concentrate on w hat is around them because they are thinking about other things.  Josephine s ays, “Maybe he’s just thinking when he stares off into space.”  Andre says, “Mayb e.  All I know is that my science grade is riding on how well do in the lab, so I hope he shapes up.” Andre is concerned that Matt, as his partner, won’t do h is work correctly and they will both get a bad grade.  He says his science grade is “ riding on.”  To “ride on”

 means to depend on, to be affected by something.  So, yo u could say, “The amount of money I get at my work is riding on how many sa les I can make this year.”  It’s dependent on that thing.  To “shape up” m eans to improve, to do better.  Somebody says, “he needs to shape up,” they mean  he needs to do better; he needs to meet the standards or expectations of  this other person.

Well, Andre is hoping that Matt will “shape up” – he  will get better so that his science grade doesn’t “suffer,” doesn’t go lower because of him.  The word “shape” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Josephine says, “I’m sure he will (I’m sure he will shape up).  And even if he doesn’t, you’re clever enough to still do well in the cla ss.”  To be “clever” means to be smart, but specifically to be able to find new or creative solutions to something.  We might describe, for example, a police det ective – someone who tries to find the person who committed a crime – as bein g “clever,” smart, able to figure out a situation or understand a situation.

Andre says, “Thanks, Mom, but I wouldn’t bet on it!”  To  “bet on” something is a phrasal verb meaning to believe that something is or wil l be true.  In fact, you are so sure that is going to happen that you are willing to  “bet,” to gamble money, saying that this will happen.  It’s a general expression m eaning it probably won’t happen; you should not depend on that happening.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Andre:  Mom, I can’t believe I got stuck with Matt as my l ab partner in school.

Josephine:  Matt?  Do I know Matt?

Andre:  He lives down the street.  He’s Mr. and Mrs. Ke mp’s son.  He’s a total airhead.

Josephine:  Oh, I remember him.  He was at your birth day party.

Andre:  Yeah, when I was nine years old!  That guy is so dense!

Josephine:  Matt was always considered a gifted child.  He seemed bright and perceptive, and his parents thought he’d go far.

 Andre:  If you ask me, he’s not all there.  Every time I look over at him in class, he’s staring off into space.  He doesn’t seem like the kind  who’s very quick on the uptake.

Josephine:  You know, some very smart people can seem spacey t o the rest of us.  Maybe he’s just thinking when he stares off into space.

Andre:  Maybe.  All I know is that my science grade is rid ing on how we do in the lab, so I hope he shapes up.

Josephine:  I’m sure he will.  And even if he doesn’t, you’re clever enough to still do well in the class.

Andre:  Thanks, Mom, but I wouldn’t bet on it!

# Common Traffic Signs

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 14: Common Traffic Signs.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 414.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Common Traffic Signs.”  It’s going  to talk about the kinds of signs you see when you drive.  It will be a dialogu e between Ben and Lauren, and they’re going to be having a little problem readi ng the traffic signs.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ben:  Why are you squinting like that?

Lauren:  I left my glasses at the office.

Ben:  You mean you can’t see?!

Lauren:  I can see pretty well.  What was that yellow si gn we just passed?

Ben:  It said, “Dead End.”  Stop!  Turn around.

Lauren:  I can’t.  That sign says, “No U-turn.”

Ben:  Okay, but we can’t keep going.  Those signs say, “Do Not Enter” and “One Way.”

Lauren:  Okay, fine.  I’ll just pull off the road and you can drive.

Ben:  You can’t.  That sign says, “No Stopping.”  Hey, you  just made an illegal U- turn!

Lauren:  What else could I do?  Anyway, we’re back on tr ack now.

 Ben:  Watch out for those speed bumps!  You really are b lind without your glasses.  You’re going too fast.  According to that sign, this is a school crossing zone.  The posted speed limit is 25 miles per hour.

Lauren:  That’s only true when the lights are flashing .  Is that a “Detour” sign?

Ben:  I can’t believe it.  Will I never get home?

[end of dialogue]

The dialogue begins with Ben asking Lauren, “Why are you  squinting like that?” To “squint” (squint) means to close your eyes partially so that only a small part of your eye can be seen.  Usually we do this if there is too  much light.  Or, if you can’t see very well, you close your eyes not all the way in o rder to see a little better.

Lauren says, “I left my glasses at the office.”  So, she sho uld have her glasses on while she drives, but she forgot them so she squints.  Ben  says, “You mean you can’t see?!” – do you mean that you cannot see?  Lauren  says, “I can see pretty well.  What was that yellow sign we just passed?”  The w ord “sign” is a common word to describe any piece of wood, metal, plastic, or pa per that has writing or pictures on it to give you information; all countries ha ve their own road signs.

Ben says the yellow sign said, “Dead End.”  He then says to Lauren, “Stop!  Turn around.”  To “turn around” means to take the car in the opposite direction, to go back from where you came.  A “dead end” is a street that doesn’t connect to any other street.  If you go down a street that is a dead end, you can’t go any farther; you have to turn around and go back to get out.

Lauren says, “I can’t (meaning I can’t turn around).  That sign says, ‘No U-turn.’” A “U-turn” is when you are driving down a street in one  direction – it’s a “two- way” street, meaning cars go in both directions – and you want to go in the opposite direction.  So you’re traveling, for example,  west on a street and now you want to go east on the street.  You can, in many pla ces, make a “U-turn,” where the car is traveling in the shape of a “U.”  You turn the car around so it goes in the other direction.  There are some places whe re a U-turn would be too dangerous, so you may see a “No U-turn” sign.

Ben says, “Okay, but we can’t keep going (meaning okay, you can’t take a U- turn, but we can’t keep going in the same direction).  Those signs say, ‘Do Not Enter’ and ‘One Way.’”  These are two other popular si gns you will see on

 American streets.  “Do not enter” means that you should n ot go down that street. Usually this is because there are cars coming from the other  direction and it would be dangerous.  A “one-way” street is a street tha t drivers can only move in one direction; they can only go north or they can only g o south.  A “two-way” street is a street where drivers go in both directions.  And of course, here in the United States, people drive on the right side of the st reet – the right side of the “road,” which is just another name for a street or a hi ghway.

Lauren says, “Okay, fine.  I’ll just pull off the road and you can drive.”  To “pull off” the road or the street means to slow your car down  and eventually to stop driving.  You put your car on one side of the road or st reet for a short period of time.  For example, if you get a cell phone call – a mo bile phone call – you may pull off the road so you can talk to that person and no t have to worry about causing an accident.  In some states it’s illegal to talk on  your cell phone in the car, at least to have the phone up to your face, so you may pull off the road, or pull off to the side of the road.  Lauren says she’s going to pull off the road and allow Ben to drive.  That term, “pull off,” has a coup le of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

Ben says to Lauren, “You can’t,” meaning you can’t pull o ff the road here.  He points to another sign that says, “No Stopping.”  “No St opping” is a sign that tells drivers that they can’t pull off to the side of the roa d or the side of the freeway. They have to keep driving because it would not be safe t o pull off the road at that point.  Ben then says, “Hey, you just made an illegal U-t urn!” meaning she made a U-turn where it wasn’t allowed – it wasn’t permitte d.

Lauren says, “What else could I do?  Anyway, we’re back on track now.”  To be “back on track” means to be doing something correctly after  doing it incorrectly for a certain amount of time.  So you’re doing somethi ng wrong, and then you realize and you correct your mistake, and now you’re doing  it correctly – the right way – we would say you “got back on track.”

Ben says, “Watch out for those speed bumps!”  A “speed bump ” is a small section of the road that is higher than the rest of the  road; it causes the cars to slow down.  If you try to go over a speed bump at a hi gh speed you could damage your car.  Speed bumps have become very popular in  Los Angeles in the last few years.  Many of the streets where there’s a l ot of traffic also have many people who live that street, and so they complain th at the traffic is dangerous for them and the city puts in speed bumps to sl ow the traffic down.  I personally don’t really like these, but then again, I do n’t live on a busy street.

 Ben then says to Lauren, “You really are blind without your glasses.”  To be “blind” means to be unable to see – you cannot see.  If  someone says, “you’re blind without your glasses,” they mean you cannot see very w ell at all unless you have your glasses on.  I am this way; I am blind without m y glasses.  My wife says I’m blind with my glasses, too, but that’s another pro blem!

Ben says, “You’re going too fast.  According to that sign,  this is a school crossing zone.”  A “school crossing” is a part of the street where many children, next to a school, will be crossing the street.  Because it is dangero us for children to be crossing the street when there is a lot of traffic – whe n there are a lot of cars – many places put up “school crossing” signs, meaning you should  be extra careful – you should be very careful in this area because children w ill be crossing the street, going from one side of the street to the other .  A “zone” is just another word for an area.

“The posted speed limit,” Ben says, “is 25 miles per hour .”  The “speed limit” is the maximum speed that you can drive in a particular area  or on a particular street.  In most cities, the speed limit is between 25 a nd 35 miles per hour.  That would be between 40 and 55 kilometers per hour, rough ly – approximately.  The word “posted” means that something is put in a place wh ere everyone can see it. So, the “posted speed limit” is the speed limit you see on the side of the road. On American freeways and highways the speed limit varies c onsiderably.  It’s different in different places even in different parts of the country, so you need to look at the posted speed limit to make sure you aren’t d riving too fast.

Lauren says, “That’s only true when the lights are flashi ng,” meaning the posted speed limit is 25 miles an hour only when the lights on the sign are flashing.  To “flash” means to go on and off, on and off repeatedly,  and usually quickly.  Some speed limits are only used when the sign is flashing; if t he sign isn’t flashing, then you don’t have to worry about that speed limit.  The wo rd “flash” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lauren says, “Is that a ‘Detour’ sign?”  A “detour” is a n alternate route; it’s a way to go from one place to another place when the normal  route – the normal way that you would go – is not possible.  So for example, i f they are fixing the street – there is construction on the street, or there’s a special e vent and the street is blocked – the street is closed – you might have to “take a  detour,” meaning you might have to go a different way in order to get to w here you want to go.

Ben says, “I can’t believe it.  Will I never get home?”  This expression, “will I never...” plus the verb or the result, is used when you d on’t believe something will

 happen even though you want it to happen.  So you wan t to get home, but because of all the difficulties it doesn’t look like you’r e going to get home.  So you may say, “Will I never get home?”  Or if you have, say, a n eighbor whose children like to cry and scream in the street – this is just an example, I’m not talking about my neighbor and his child – you may say, “Wi ll that child never shut up?” – will that child never be quiet.  The answer, of course, is no!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ben:  Why are you squinting like that?

Lauren:  I left my glasses at the office.

Ben:  You mean you can’t see?!

Lauren:  I can see pretty well.  What was that yellow si gn we just passed?

Ben:  It said, “Dead End.”  Stop!  Turn around.

Lauren:  I can’t.  That sign says, “No U-turn.”

Ben:  Okay, but we can’t keep going.  Those signs say, “Do Not Enter” and “One Way.”

Lauren:  Okay, fine.  I’ll just pull off the road and you can drive.

Ben:  You can’t.  That sign says, “No Stopping.”  Hey, you  just made an illegal U- turn!

# Being Clean and Dirty

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 15: Being Clean and Dirty.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 415.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.

You can visit our website at eslpod.com.  There, you can f ind our Learning Guide, an 8 to 10 page guide to this episode to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Being Clean and Dirty.”  It’s a d ialogue between Ray and Debra where they’re talking about how each one of the m is either clean or dirty, using a lot of vocabulary we would use to describe someone  who is either clean or not so clean – dirty.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ray:  My mother is coming for a visit, which means we need  to do some spring cleaning this weekend.

Debra:  I’ll get the duster, if you’ll get the broom.

Ray:  I’m serious.  You know how nit-picky my mother is and  I want our house to be neat and tidy.

Debra:  Fine, fine, I understand.  You don’t want he r to know we live in a pigsty.

Ray:  I’m not saying we live in a pigsty, but the house i s a little messy and dusty. It wouldn’t hurt to straighten up a little bit, tha t’s all.

Debra:  I’m willing to pitch in, but I’m not going t o spend the entire weekend slaving away to get this house spotless.  Your mother won’t  love you any less if you’re not a neat freak.

Ray:  You don’t know my mother very well.

Debra:  I know her well enough.  I don’t want to spo il her fun.  If she can’t complain about our dirty house, what will she complain about?

 [end of dialogue]

Ray and Debra are having a conversation about cleaning the house because Ray’s mother is coming to visit.  Ray says, “My mother is comin g for a visit, which means we need to do some spring cleaning this weekend.”  The expression “spring cleaning” is used to describe a period of time wh ere you clean your house very well.  Usually it happens about once a year, often i n the spring, in the early part of the year.  “Spring cleaning,” however, is a gen eral term that means that you’re going to clean everything in your house; you’re g oing to “throw out” or get rid of things you don’t need anymore.  That’s another m eaning of the expression.

Debra says, “I’ll get the duster, if you get the broom.”   A “duster” (duster) is a small tool; it’s a piece of wood or plastic that you hol d on to and it has, usually, either a lot of feathers, like from a bird, or a very light cloth – material – at one end.  It’s used to clean tables and shelves and other th ings in your house that may have a lot of dirt on them – a lot of dust.  A “br oom” is typically a long pole that has at one end either straw or plastic, and it’s use d to clean a floor – to sweep a floor.  The verb “to sweep” means to take, in t his case, a broom and move it across the floor in order to clean it.  Sweeping  with a broom does not involve water or soap; it’s simply removing the things that  are on the floor.

Ray says, “I’m serious,” meaning he thinks Debra is joking.  “You know how nit- picky my mother is and I want our house to be neat and ti dy,” he says.  “Nit- picky” comes from the verb to “nit pick” (nit pick).  To “ni t pick” means to pay a lot of attention to small things and not be happy – not be  satisfied – until everything is perfect.  It’s generally considered a negative descripti on of someone who tries to be too perfect and tries to criticize someone else for every small problem.  Ray says he wants the house to be “neat and tidy.”  To be “ne at and tidy” means to be well organized and clean.  The word “neat” has a cou ple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Debra says, “Fine, fine, I understand (she’s saying “okay, oka y”).  You don’t want her to know we live in a pigsty.”  A “pigsty” (pigsty – one  word) is, literally, a place where pigs live.  But people consider pigs to be very dirt y, so when they talk about a pigsty they’re talking about a very dirty and unor ganized place.  Ray says, “I’m not saying we live in a pigsty, but the house is a little messy and dusty.”  To be “messy” (messy) means to be unorganized, wher e things are not where they should be.  “Dusty” means that there are smal l pieces of dirt on top of the furniture or other parts of the house.

He then says, “It wouldn’t hurt to straighten up a litt le bit, that’s all.”  When someone says “it wouldn’t hurt to...” do something, such  as “it wouldn’t hurt to go

 home a little early so we can get more sleep tonight,” they mean that it would be a good idea, that it would be a helpful thing.  Ray says, “It wouldn’t hurt to straighten up a little bit.”  To “straighten up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to organize things while you are cleaning them, to put things away where they belong.

Debra says, “I’m willing to pitch in.”  To “pitch in” is,  again, a two-word verb meaning to help with a project, to give some assistance to  complete something. Someone who is going to “pitch in” is going to help.  They’re not going to do the whole thing themselves, but they will assist or help someon e else with it.  The word “pitch” has a couple of different – very different  meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Debra says, “I’m not going to spend the entire weekend sl aving away to get this house spotless.”  The expression – the verb to “slave away”  is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to work very hard, to do something d ifficult for a long time. “Spotless” is perfectly clean.  If something is dirty, we m ay say it has a “spot” on it.  For example, if you are at a baseball game and you ’re eating a hot dog and you have some mustard on your hot dog, and some of the mu stard falls onto your shirt, that would create a spot – a spot of dirt –  a small place where it is dirty.  “Spotless” is the opposite of that; it’s perfectl y clean, something with no spots.

Debra says, “Your mother won’t love you any less if you’re not a neat freak.”  The expression “your mother won’t love you any less” means she wo n’t care that much, she’ll still love you even though you are not someth ing.  In this case, you are not a neat freak.  “Neat,” we already know, mean s clean and organized.  The word “freak” (freak) describe someone who does things in t he extreme or someone who does things very strangely, someone who is very w eird.  Again, it’s not usually considered a positive quality in someone.  A “n eat freak” would be someone who wants everything to be clean all the time eve rywhere, particularly in their own house or home.

Ray says, “You don’t know my mother very well,” meaning may be my mother won’t love me if I’m not a neat freak.  Poor Ray!  Deb ra says, “I know her well enough.”  Of course, Debra is Ray’s mother’s daughter-in- law; she is her mother- in-law, and traditionally there’s always a little fricti on – some difficulties often between the son-in-law and the mother-in-law, or the  daughter-in-law and the mother-in-law, and so forth.

Well, Debra says, “I know her well enough,” meaning I kn ow her sufficiently to be able to say something.  You don’t know them perfectly, b ut you know them

 enough – you know them sufficiently.  Debra says, “I don’ t want to spoil her fun.” To “spoil (spoil) someone’s fun” means to make something less fun for somebody, to make something less enjoyable.  A parent may say to their child, “I don’t mean to spoil your fun, but now you must go to b ed, it is late.  No more television for you!”

Debra says, “I don’t want to spoil (Ray’s mother’s) fun.”  She says, “If she can’t complain about our dirty house, what will she complain about?”  To “complain” means to say that you are unhappy about something, to say that you don’t like something.  If you check into a hotel and your room is di rty, you may call down and complain to the front desk, the people who are resp onsible for the hotel. Debra is saying that Ray’s mother likes to have fun by compl aining about things. There are, of course, people like this in the world – n ot my mother-in-law!  Debra says, “If she can’t complain about our dirty house, what wi ll she complain about?” meaning if we clean up the house she won’t have any fun because she can’t complain.  She, of course, is making a joke here – Debra  is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ray:  My mother is coming for a visit, which means we need  to do some spring cleaning this weekend.

Debra:  I’ll get the duster, if you’ll get the broom.

Hello, business students.  I’m here today at your professor’ s request to talk to you about the importance of finding your own niche in b usiness.  Conventional wisdom says that people in business need to diversify their ski ll sets so that they can be the most flexible in whatever field they decide to  enter.  While there is some truth to this, that’s only half of the picture.

Those who diversify too much run the risk of being a jack of all trades and master of none.  Not having a focused set of skills may also be see n as indecisive from the standpoint of a potential employer, and your appli cation may fall by the wayside as a result.  Having a niche will help you stand ou t in the crowd.

In business, it’s a balancing act between having the gener al skills that any company will want, and also possessing specialized skills that will make you the go-to person in your organization.  Keep this in mind a nd you’ll go far.

We listened to a businessperson, a businessman, who is tal king to a college class.  He begins by saying, “I’m here at your professor’s req uest.”  When you say “at someone’s request,” you mean you are doing somethin g because someone asked you to do it.  So he is there because the pr ofessor asked him to be there.  He asked him to talk to the students about t he importance of finding their own niche in business.  A “niche” (niche) is a specia lty; it’s something that

 you can do better than other people can.  It’s something  that you are particularly good at.

“Conventional wisdom,” he says, “says that people in busine ss need to diversify their skill sets.”  The term “conventional wisdom” means so mething very similar to common sense, or what most people think and believe.  Conventional wisdom says that people in business need to diversify.  To “diversify”  (or “diversify”) means to have a lot of variety, to have many different kin ds of things.  They say that when you are investing your money for the future yo u should consider diversifying: putting a little money in stocks, a little mo ney in savings accounts, and so forth.  The noun for “diversify” is “diversity.”

He says that business conventional wisdom states that you nee d to diversify your skill sets.  A “skill set” (two words) is a group of things that you are able to do, things that you are good at.  It really just means the same as skills, but for some reason now in the business world people say “skill set” inste ad of just “skills,” things that you can do.

Why do you need this diversified skill set?  Well, conventio nal wisdom says that you need to be flexible in whatever field you enter.  T o be “flexible” means to be able to do different things – switch between different  things easily.  He says, “While there is some truth to this,” meaning this is par tially true, “that’s only half of the picture,” or half the picture.  “Half of the p icture” means you don’t have the whole idea; you have incomplete information.  You don ’t understand everything – the whole thing.  We would say “the whole picture.”  A  “picture,” of course, is something that you put on a wall.  It might be a pain ting by a famous artist – that would be a picture – Monet, for example, the famous F rench painter.  A “picture” can also refer to a photograph, but here it just refer s to the situation.

He continues by saying, “Those who diversify too much run the risk of being a jack of all trades and master of none.”  To “run the ri sk of something” means to do something knowing that there is a possibility that some thing bad will happen as a result.  If you drink alcohol and then you decide t o drive, you run the risk of hurting yourself and others in an accident.  The expression  “a jack of all trades and master of none” is an old expression to refer to peo ple who are able to do many things a little bit.  That is, they know a little  bit about a lot of things but they’re not very good at any one thing.  This is a critici sm – a negative statement about someone – if you say “She is a jack of all trades an d master of none.” “Trades,” here, simply means different skills.  “Master” wo uld be the person who is in charge, who is able to do a lot.  So, if you have too much diversity in your skill set, you may be a jack of all trades but master of non e.

 “Not having a focused set of skills may also be seen as indecisi ve.”  “Indecisive” means you can’t decide.  Again, it’s considered a negative  description, a criticism.  “He’s indecisive,” that means he can’t decide wha t he wants to do.  He says the person that diversifies, who doesn’t have a focused se t of skills, may be seen as indecisive from the standpoint of a potential emp loyer.  The expression “from the standpoint of someone” means from someone’s pr ospective, considering the way that someone will think about a par ticular situation.  We might also say from someone’s “viewpoint.”  So, from the  standpoint of the person who may be hiring you, the potential employer, t his is not a good thing. Because of this, your application may fall by the wayside a s a result.  To “fall by the wayside” (wayside – one word) means to not be used o r stop being used because there are too many other things – there are to o many other important things.  There may be certain things that you talk about at work but because you have many different projects, some of them fall by the wa yside, they are no longer important enough to consider talking about and doing something about them.

He says, “Having a niche will help you stand out in the cr owd.”  The expression to “stand out in the crowd” means to be different from  the people around you, to be different from other people, to be noticed.  If yo u have pink hair you will stand out in the crowd, people will notice you.  Because I d on’t have any hair I have to paint my head pink to get someone to notice me!

He continues, “In business, it’s a balancing act between h aving the general skills that any company will want, and also possessing specialized skil ls that will make you the go-to person in your organization.”  Couple of expressions there, the first is a “balancing act.”  A “balancing act” is when you try to  do two things at the same time, often two opposite things or two very differ ent things.  Or, you’re trying to make two different people happy that have two  very different ideas or interests.  This is a balancing act.  The word “balance” h as several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

So, if you are applying for a job you need to have gene ral skills and “specialized,” or specific, skills.  You have to have specific skills – specialize d skills – to make you the go-to person in your organization.  The expression  “a go-to person” is the person in an office or an organization or business who see ms to know everything.  He or she is the person that everyone goes to when they need help or information.

“Keep this in mind and you’ll go far,” he concludes.  To  “go far,” here, means to succeed, to do well in life.  If someone tells you you’ll go far in life, well, that means you will be successful, and I hope you are.

 Now let’s listen to the speech, this time at a normal sp eed.

# Getting Travel Documents

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 17: Getting Travel Documents.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 417.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Please go there and download  a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definit ions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Getting Travel Documents.”  It’s a  dialogue between Steve and Joyce about passports, visas, and other things that you need to know if you are going to travel to another country.  Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Joyce:  We need to apply for our passports now if we want to have them in time for our trip to McQuillanland.

Steven:  I have a passport.

Joyce:  Yes, but it expired last year.  You need to renew it before you can get a visa.  McQuillanland requires a visa and vaccinations before  they’ll allow entry into the country.

Steven:  Okay, okay, where is the application?  I thought  U.S. citizens could travel freely in McQuillanland.

Joyce:  That used to be true, but their policies have chang ed.  We also need to bring our applications to their consulate in person, wit h all of the supporting documents.

Steven:  Fine.  The application asks which visa classification  we’re applying for. Should I check student or tourist?

Joyce:  Even though we’re taking a language course while we’re there, we’re asking for a tourist visa.  We can stay for three months on a tourist visa.

 Steven:  What are they going to do if we overstay our visa, deport us?

Joyce:  Yes they will, and you don’t want to deal with the McQuillanland authorities.  They’re not known for being kind to lawbr eakers.

Steven:  Those McQuillanlanders are my kind of people.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Joyce saying to her husband Steve n, “We need to apply for our passports now if we want to have them in  time for our trip to McQuillanland.”  A “passport” is an official document t hat you get from your government where you are a citizen that allows you to tra vel outside of the country; it allows you to go to another country.  A passpor t usually is a small little book that has your photograph and many different pages i n it so that each country you visit can put their mark – a stamp – on your pa ssport.  Passports in the U.S. for adults are usually good for 10 years.  So once you get a passport, you don’t need to “renew,” or get a different passport , for 10 years.

Joyce says they need to apply for their passports if they want to have them in time for their trip to McQuillanland.  The expression “ in time for” means before something else happens, before something is due.  If the  party starts at seven o’clock, you need to arrive by seven to be there in time f or the beginning.  Of course, if you’re here in Los Angeles, you would probably arrive about an hour late.  At least that’s what a lot of people here do; they don’t come in time for the beginning of the party, or at the time the party begi ns.

Well, Steve and Joyce are going to McQuillanland – which is, of course, is a very exciting place to visit!  Steven says, “I have a passport.”  Jo yce says, “Yes, but it expired last year.”  When something “expires,” it is no longer good; it is no longer valid.  It was only good for a certain amount of time and now that time is over.  If you are a student taking a test in school and you are give n 30 minutes to complete the test, at the end the teacher might say, “T ime has expired.”  “The passport has expired” means that it is no longer good, you  need to get a new one; you need to “renew” it, to get a new document in  place of the old one.

Joyce says, “You need to renew (your passport) before you can get a visa.”  A “visa” is a document from another country that gives you p ermission to enter that country, usually for a certain amount of time.  Many peo ple who travel to the United States may need to get a visa, special permission fr om the United States government that allows you to come to this country.  Your  passport, then, comes from your government in your country; a visa, if it’s necessa ry, will come from the

 government that you are visiting, or the government of t he country that you are visiting.

Joyce says, “McQuillanland,” which apparently is a little dan gerous, “requires a visa and vaccinations before they’ll allow entry into the co untry.”  “Vaccinations” are drugs – injections that you get to prevent you from getting a specific disease later in life.  Here in the United States, for exampl e, all of the babies and young children are given vaccinations against diseases such as polio  and the measles. Vaccinations are sometimes required when you visit another country that may have illnesses that you are not familiar or prepared for  – or your body is not prepared for.  Joyce says you need the vaccinations before Mc Quillanland will allow entry into the country.  “Entry” (entry) is the pr ocess of going into another country.  “Is this your first entry to the United States?”  – is this the first time you have come here?  “Entry” has a couple of different meani ngs in English; take a look at that Learning Guide I recommended for more in formation.

Steven, who’s obviously not the smart one here, says, “Okay, okay, where is the application (meaning the passport application).  I thou ght U.S. citizens could travel freely in McQuillanland.”  The expression “to trave l freely” means be able to go from one country to another without needing a sp ecial visa or special permission.  This is very common, for example, in Europe, where people can travel often from one country to another without any sor t of special visa or permission from the government.

Joyce, who is obviously the smart one, says, “That used to be true (it used to be true that you could travel freely), but (McQuillanland ’s) policies have changed.” Their “policies” are their rules, their regulations, th eir official way of doing something.  Joyce says, “We also need to bring our applicati ons to their consulate in person, with all of the supporting document s.”  A “consulate” (consulate) is a building that belongs to another countr y where people can get help if they want to travel to that country.  A consulate  does many different things.  In every country there is one main building that  is usually in the capital of that country, that’s called the “embassy.”  But sometimes in  other cities of the country there may be other offices of that country’s govern ment, which we call “consulates.”  Here in Los Angeles there are consulates fr om many different countries, but the main building – the embassies – are l ocated in Washington, D.C.

So, Joyce says they have to go to the consulate in person, m eaning you have to each go there; you can’t just mail it in, you have to go  to the building yourself. They have to go with all of their supporting documents.   These are usually other papers that someone needs to look at in addition to your  main application, or

 your main solicitation.  These may include your birth cer tificate or proof of citizenship.

Steven says, “Fine.  The application asks which visa classificatio n we’re applying for.”  A “classification” is the type or kind of something.   Different countries have different visa classifications.  Here in the United State s you might be a student, that’s one kind of visa.  Or you might be coming here just  to visit, that’s another kind of visa.  Visa classifications will be different in each  country.  Steven says, “Should I check student or tourist?”  A “tourist” is a pe rson who visits another country for a short period of time, usually just to have f un on vacation; they’re not working or studying.

Joyce says, “Even though (although) we’re taking a language  course while we’re there (in McQuillanland, because they must speak a differ ent language), we’re applying for a tourist visa (we’re asking for a tourist visa ).  We can stay three months on a tourist visa,” meaning with that particular classification they can stay in the country for three months.

Steven asks, “What are they going to do if we overstay our visa, deport us?”  To “overstay your visa” means to stay in a country longer than yo u have permission to, to stay in a country after your visa has expired.  Usual ly that’s not a good idea, especially here in the U.S.  To “deport” someone  means to make that person leave the country, usually because he or she is not allowed to stay in the country, or perhaps because you have broken the law – you  have done something illegal and the country is sending you back to h ome country.  That’s “deporting” someone; the noun would be “deportation .”

Joyce says, “Yes they will (yes, they will deport us), and you d on’t want to deal with the McQuillanland authorities.”  To “deal with”  means you don’t want to have interactions with – you don’t want to be talking to the  McQuillanland authorities. “Authorities” are the people who are in charge, ofte n government officials.  Joyce says these McQuillanland authorities are not known for b eing kind to lawbreakers.  “Are not known,” here, means that’s not t heir reputation, that’s not what people think about them.  They don’t think that t hey’re kind to lawbreakers. A “lawbreaker” (one word) is a person who does something  illegal, something against the law, someone who breaks the law.  So the McQ uillanland authorities, I guess, are pretty tough – pretty difficult to get alon g with.

Steven says, “Those McQuillanlanders (those people who live in McQuillanland) are my kind of people.”  When someone says their one’s “kin d of people,” they mean they are people that you would feel comfortable w ith because they have

 the same opinions and beliefs and way of living that you  have.  I think the McQuillanland people would be my kind of people!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Joyce:  We need to apply for our passports now if we want to have them in time for our trip to McQuillanland.

Steven:  I have a passport.

Joyce:  Yes, but it expired last year.  You need to renew it before you can get a visa.  McQuillanland requires a visa and vaccinations before  they’ll allow entry into the country.

# Getting Bad Service

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 18: Getting Bad Service.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 418.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there and download a Lea rning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, and a complete transcript of this episode.

This episode is called “Getting Bad Service.”  It’s a dial ogue between two people talking about the bad customer service they received at a c offee house (or a coffee shop) that they went to.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Buck:  I’m never going to that coffee house again!

Star:  Why?  What happened?

Buck:  It’s the third time in a week that I’ve had lousy se rvice.  I don’t expect five- star treatment, but I do expect service industry employees to be at least civil.

Star:  What happened this time?

Buck:  I walked in and went up to the counter to place m y order.  The woman working there was talking to her friend, another custome r.  I stood there, clearly needing to be waited on and she couldn’t have cared l ess.

Star:  You mean she didn’t even acknowledge you?

Buck:  Are you kidding?  She didn’t stop talking for one second.  When she finally took a breath, I told her my order.  She gave me a dir ty look and finally turned around to get my coffee.  She practically threw it at me !

Star:  Well, maybe she was having a bad day.  At least you  got your coffee.

Buck:  I got a  cup of coffee, but not the kind I ordered.  When I r ealized it, I went back to the counter and she was still talking to her frien d.  I interrupted her and

 told her that I got the wrong order.  She had the ch utzpah to try to tell me that I had made a mistake in telling her my order.  Not only d id she not take responsibility for her mistake, she tried to tell me that  it was my fault!

Star:  That’s really infuriating.  What are you going to do?

Buck:  One good thing about her talking with her frien d for so long is that I got her name.  I’ll be calling the manager to complain.

Star:  Aren’t you overreacting?

Buck:  No, I’m not.  She’s lucky I didn’t pour the coffee over her head!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Buck saying to his friend Star, “I’m never going to that coffee house again!” – that café where they serve coffee.   Star says, “Why? What happened?”  Buck says, “It’s the third time in a wee k that I’ve had lousy service.”  “Lousy” (lousy) means bad, not very good, poor quality.  So, “lousy service” is bad service.

He says, “I didn’t expect five-star treatment, but I do ex pect service industry employees to at least be civil.”  “Five-star treatment” w ould be very good customer service, service that makes you feel like an importa nt person.  So when you go to a restaurant and the waiter is nice to you and  gives you good service, helps you, that would be, possibly, five-star treatment.  “Service industry” refers to businesses who provide services to other companies or to other people. Hotels and restaurants are both part of the service indust ry.  So, Buck is saying here that he expects people (employees who work in the s ervice industries) to be at least civil or to at least be civil.  “Civil” means pol ite, formal, not necessarily friendly.  Someone can be polite to you but not be fri endly to you, that’s called being “civil.”  The word “civil” has several different me anings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Star says, “What happened this time?”  Buck says, “I walked i n and went up to the counter to place my order.”  A “counter” in a store or a business is usually a long, flat surface like a table, where the customer stand s on one side and the employee stands on the other side.  Often if you are go ing to buy something, you would go up to the counter (or the sales counter) and t he employee would take your money or your credit card.

 So, Buck goes up to the counter of this coffee shop and t he woman working there was talking to her friend, another customer.  He says, “I stood there, clearly needing to be waited on and she couldn’t have cared l ess.”  The expression “to be waited on” means that you are helped or served by an  employee; to have an employee ask, for example, what you want to buy or how t hey can help you. Buck says, “I stood there (meaning I stood waiting there) clearly needing to be waited on and she (the employee) couldn’t have cared less .”  The expression “I couldn’t have cared less” means to show that something is e xtremely unimportant (or not important) to you; something is le ss important than everything else.  For example: “I thought my professor wo uld be mad when I arrived at the classroom late, but he couldn’t have care d less,” meaning he didn’t care at all; it wasn’t important to him.  You will al so hear native speakers say, “I could have cared less,” but they mean “I couldn’t have care d less.”  There’s some confusion now and some people say, “I could have cared less,” but the original expression is “I couldn’t have cared less.”  That’ s what makes sense in this case.

Star says, “You mean she didn’t even acknowledge you?”  T o “acknowledge” someone means to recognize that someone is there, usuall y by looking into their eyes and saying “hello,” even if you don’t have time to s peak with them.  So the employee might look at you and nod her head and smile so that you know that she knows that you are waiting.  But apparently, this emp loyee didn’t even acknowledge Buck.  Buck says, “Are you kidding?  She didn’t st op talking (to her friend) for one second (she kept talking to her).  When she finally took a breath, I told her my order.”  To “take a breath” (breath) mean s to stop speaking for a short period of time so that you can breathe in.  I nee d to do this when I am recording the podcast; I need to stop sometimes and take a breath.  Here, it means a short amount of time.

So, when she stopped talking for short amount of time B uck told her his “order,” what he wanted to buy.  The employee gave him a dirty l ook.  A “dirty look” is when you change your face so that the other person knows yo u are not happy or you are angry.  If you walk into a library and you are t alking loudly or laughing, the people working there (the librarians) may give you a  dirty look.  I do this all the time when I’m in a restaurant and someone starts yel ling on their cell phone (their mobile phone) in the table next to me.  I tur n and I give them a dirty look, because, of course, it’s not polite to have your telephon e conversation in someone else’s ear.  You should step outside the restauran t and continue your phone call.  Well, that’s the way it should work, but t his is Los Angeles and it doesn’t work that way very often.

 Buck says that the employee gave him “a dirty look and fin ally turned around to get my coffee.  She practically threw it at me!”  “Practi cally,” here, means almost, virtually, nearly.  “Practically” can mean in a practical w ay, but here, when someone says “she practically kicked me,” or, “he practically ki lled me,” you mean they almost, nearly but not quite.  So, when the employee practically threw the coffee at Buck, she didn’t actually throw it but it w as something like that.

Star says, “Well, maybe she was having a bad day.  At least you got your coffee.” Buck says, “I got a  cup of coffee, but not the kind I ordered.  When I r ealized (this mistake), I went back to the counter and she was still tal king to her friend.  I interrupted her...” that is, I began speaking even tho ugh she was still speaking to someone else so that she would stop and listen to me.  “I  interrupted her and told her that I got the wrong order.  She had the chutzpah  to try to tell me that I had made a mistake in telling her my order.  “Chutzpah,” spe lled C-H-U-T-Z-P-A-H, is a Yiddish word meaning courage or confidence to do some thing that other people probably wouldn’t do, usually because they may be scared to do it. Another word we could use here is “nerve”: “She had the  nerve.”  Chutzpah can be a good thing; some people, in some circumstances, may make it a bad thing, doing that something that someone else doesn’t want or  would not do.  So, “She had the chutzpah to say that I made a mistake in telling  her my order.  Not only did she not take responsibility for her mistake, she tried  to tell me it was my fault!” To “take responsibility” for something means to agree th at something is your fault, to accept the consequences of your actions: “Yes, I m ade a mistake.”

Star says to Buck, “That’s really infuriating.”  Something  that is “infuriating” makes you very angry or mad.  Star says, “What are you goin g to do?”  Buck says, “One good thing about her talking with her friend  for so long is that I got her name,” meaning I remembered or I figured out – I wa s able to get this piece of information, namely her name.  Buck says, “I’ll be calling  the manager to complain.”  To say that you are unhappy about something  is to “complain.”

Star says, “Aren’t you overreacting?”  To “overreact” mean s to respond to something too strongly, to make something more importan t than it really is.  So, if your waiter forgets to bring French fries with your ha mburger, and you start yelling at the waiter and getting on your feet and p ounding your fist on the table, that would be “overreacting,” getting too emotional, too excited about something.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Buck:  I’m never going to that coffee house again!

 Star:  Why?  What happened?

Buck:  It’s the third time in a week that I’ve had lousy se rvice.  I don’t expect five- star treatment, but I do expect service industry employees to be at least civil.

This episode is called “Planting a Garden.”  It’s going to be conversation between Joni and Giuseppe talking about planting things in your  back yard in back of your house in the ground so that they will grow.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Joni:  Smell that!

Giuseppe:  Smell what?

Joni:  Smell that fresh air.  Aren’t you glad I got you  to help me plant this garden? We’re going to have so much fun today.

Giuseppe:  Uh huh.  I’m glad to help, but I don’t exa ctly have a green thumb.

Joni:  That’s okay.  As long as you can tell a shovel from a lawn mower, you’ll be fine.  Let’s start by moving these pots next to the bushes.

Giuseppe:  Okay, your wish is my command.

Joni:  Oh, this bag of fertilizer is so heavy.

Giuseppe:  Let me get that.

Joni:  Thanks.  I didn’t know we had so many large bags of  seeds, too.

Giuseppe:  Do you want me to help you with those?

Joni:  Thanks a lot.  I’ll also need someone to help me hoe this soil.

 Giuseppe:  I guess I could do that.

Joni:  And how am I going to pull all of these weeds?

Giuseppe:  Honestly, I think we need reinforcements.

Joni:  Good idea.  You start working and I’ll go see i f I can round up more help. [She leaves.]

Giuseppe:  I start working while she leaves?  Hmm…I thin k she just pulled a fast one on me.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Joni saying to Giuseppe, “Smel l that!”  “Smell” meaning take your nose and try to smell it.  Giuseppe says, “Smell what?”  Joni says, “Smell that fresh air.”  The “fresh air” is air outside  that smells good; it smells clean.  Joni says, “Aren’t you glad I got you to help m e plant this garden?  We’re going to have so much fun today.”  To “plant,” here, me ans to put seeds in the ground so that the plants will grow.  A “garden” is u sually a small piece of land that is used to grow plants, usually flowers or vegetables,  perhaps fruit.

Joni says that she thinks they’re going to have so much (or a  lot of) fun today. Giuseppe says, “Uh huh.”  That expression, “uh huh,” means  you don’t really agree with the person; you’re saying yes but you don’t mean yes, or you mean yes but you aren’t very enthusiastic about it. Giuseppe says, “I’m glad to help, but I don’t exactly have a green thumb.”  The expression “to h ave a green thumb” means that you can make things grow well, you can make pla nts and flowers – things in the ground – you can make them grow; you are g ood at that sort of thing.

Joni says, “That’s okay.  As long as you can tell a shovel fro m a lawn mower, you’ll be fine.”  To “tell something from something el se” means to distinguish or to differentiate something from something else.  It mean s to see or understand the difference between two things.  If you’re looking at a bird you may say, “I can’t tell a male bird from a female bird.”  Hopefully you won’t  have that problem with humans!  “I can’t distinguish one from the other.”

So Joni says, “As long as you can tell a shovel from a lawn mower, you’ll be fine.”  A “shovel” (shovel) is a tool for working in a g arden, for example.  You have one long wooden piece that you hold onto, and the n usually a flat piece of metal that you push into the ground in order, for exa mple, to make a hole.  A

 “lawn mower” is a machine, usually that has an engine po wered by gasoline, that’s used to cut the lawn (to cut the grass).  So, Joni is saying as long as you know the difference between a shovel and a lawn mower,  you’ll be fine.

She says, “Let’s start by moving these pots next to the bushe s.”  A “pot” is a round container that holds dirt and usually has one or more plants that are planted in this dirt.  So it’s a container for growing  plants.  “Pot” has a couple of different meanings that are not explained in our Learning Guide – so don’t look there for any further explanations!

Joni wants to put the pots next to the bushes.  These are not the people who may have lived in the White House!  The “bushes” are lar ge, short plants that have many branches and leaves.  Giuseppe says, “Okay, your wish  is my command.”  This is an old expression: “your wish (what you want) is my command.”  I will do whatever you want me to do, that’ s the meaning of this expression: “Your wish is my command.”  It might be somethi ng a servant would say to a king or a queen, so there’s a little bit of come dy – a little bit of a joke when someone says this.

Joni then says, “Oh, this bag of fertilizer is so heavy.”  “ Fertilizer” is something that you put on the ground to make the dirt (the soil ) better so that you can grow your plants better and more quickly.  Usually fertilizer i s made from either chemicals or animal waste; that’s why fertilizer often ha s a very bad smell to it.

Giuseppe says, “Let me get that” – let me lift that up.   Joni says, “Thanks.  I didn’t know we had so many large bags of seeds, too.”  A “seed” is a small, hard piece of the plant that you put into the ground to make a new plant grow.  Giuseppe says, “Do you want me to help you with those?”  Joni says, “Thanks a lot,” meaning yes, thank you.  She says, “I also need someone t o help me hoe this soil.”  To “hoe” (hoe) means to use a special tool that has a long wooden piece that you hold onto and a piece of metal that is used to  scrape.  So it’s kind of like a shovel but smaller.  Joni wants Giuseppe to help her ho e the soil.  The “soil” is the dirt, the earth where you plant these seeds.

Giuseppe says, “I guess I could do that.”  Joni says, “And ho w am I going to pull all of those weeds?”  To “pull,” here, means to remove.   “Weeds” are plants that you don’t want.  They’re things that you don’t want to grow but are growing next to the plants that you do want.  So these are called “weeds.”  “Weed,” like the word “pot,” can also refer to marijuana, which is anoth er kind of plant that you smoke – or at least that’s what I have been told!

 Giuseppe says, “Honestly, I think we need reinforcements.”  “Reinforcements” is something or someone that helps with a project and make s it stronger or makes something stronger.  In this case, it means more people : “I think we need more people to help us.”

Joni says, “Good idea.  You start working and I’ll go see if I can round up more help.”  To “round up” something, in this sentence, me ans to find or bring something or someone.  “I’m going to go round up some of my friends” – I’m going to go out and find them and bring them back.  T o “round up” is a phrasal verb that has a couple of different meanings in English .  This time you can  go to the Learning Guide to find some additional explanati ons!

Well, Joni then leaves and Giuseppe says, “I start working while she leaves? Hmm…I think she just pulled a fast one on me.”  To “pu ll a fast one on someone” means to trick someone, to make someone do something that  he normally wouldn’t want to do, or to make someone believe somethi ng that isn’t true. That’s to “pull a fast one.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Joni:  Smell that!

Giuseppe:  Smell what?

Joni:  Smell that fresh air.  Aren’t you glad I got you  to help me plant this garden? We’re going to have so much fun today.

Giuseppe:  Uh huh.  I’m glad to help, but I don’t exa ctly have a green thumb.

Joni:  That’s okay.  As long as you can tell a shovel from a lawn mower, you’ll be fine.  Let’s start by moving these pots next to the bushes.

Giuseppe:  Okay, your wish is my command.

Joni:  Oh, this bag of fertilizer is so heavy.

Giuseppe:  Let me get that.

Joni:  Thanks.  I didn’t know we had so many large bags of  seeds, too.

 Giuseppe:  Do you want me to help you with those?

Joni:  Thanks a lot.  I’ll also need someone to help me hoe this soil.

Giuseppe:  I guess I could do that.

Joni:  And how am I going to pull all of these weeds?

Giuseppe:  Honestly, I think we need reinforcements.

Joni:  Good idea.  You start working and I’ll go see i f I can round up more help. [She leaves.]

Giuseppe:  I start working while she leaves?  Hmm…I thin k she just pulled a fast one on me.

# Workplace Safety

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 20: Workplace Safety.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 420.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode. The Learning Guides contain all of the vocabulary, defi nitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension che cks, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Workplace Safety.”  It’s a dialogu e between Lon and Abigail.  They’re going to be using vocabulary related t o accidents at work (where you have your job).  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lon:  What’s this?

Abigail:  It’s a memo about a safety inspection scheduled  for next week.

Lon:  A safety inspection?  How are we ever going to pa ss a safety inspection?

Abigail:  What do you mean?  This isn’t an unsafe workpl ace.  We’ve had a good record.  None of our employees have had on-the-job inju ries this year and we’ve never had a fatality.  I don’t understand why you’re so worried.

Lon:  From what I’ve heard, the inspectors don’t just lo ok at injury rates.  They look for the smallest hazard that may be remotely dangero us.  If we get cited, we may be shut down.

Abigail:  With all due respect, I don’t think that’s ho w it works.  Yes, the inspector will look at our work environment and our gear and mac hinery to make sure there are no hazards or toxic substances.

Lon:  That’s what I’m worried about.

 Abigail:  But, if they find a violation, we’ll get a chance to fix the problem.  They won’t shut us down without giving us a chance to comply wi th their safety standards.

Lon:  I sure hope you’re right.

Abigail:  Me, too.  We’ll know after next week’s inspect ion.

[end of dialogue]

Here in the United States the state and federal gover nment have a lot of laws to protect workers to prevent them from having injuries (to prevent them from hurting themselves) while they are working.  The federa l government has an entire agency called the Occupational Safety and Health A dministration that is responsible for many of these laws.  Individual states also have their own government agencies or organizations.

In our dialogue, Lon asks Abigail,  “What’s this (what i s this)?”  Abigail says, “It’s a memo about a safety inspection scheduled for next week.”  A “memo” is short for a memorandum.  It’s usually a short, one page, may be two or three page document that is used in offices to give someone informat ion.  Usually it’s used inside a company or inside an organization.  This is a mem o about safety inspections.  A “safety inspection” is when the government agency comes in to where you are working and makes sure that there is nothi ng dangerous about your workplace (the place you work).

Abigail says that their workplace is not unsafe.  Lon is w orried, but Abigail says no, “This isn’t an unsafe workplace.”  “Unsafe” just mean s not safe or dangerous. She says, “We’ve had a good record,” meaning a good histo ry of safe environments for people to work.  She says, “None of our employees have had on-the-job injuries this year.”  The expression “on-the-j ob” means at work, at the place where they are working.  So, none of the employee s hurt themselves at work.  She also says that we’ve never had a fatality.  A “fatality” is a death.  We hope that you don’t have any deaths at your workplace!  T hat would be a fatality.

Abigail says, “I don’t understand why you are so worried.”   Lon says, “From what I’ve heard, the inspectors (the people who come and lo ok at – inspect your workplace) don’t just look at injury (or mortality) rates. ”  When you “injure” yourself you hurt yourself, you harm yourself.  You may bre ak your arm or somehow hurt your foot; that would be an injury.  The “injury rate” would be the

 number of those injuries every month or every year, or perhaps based on every 100 employees, something like that.

Lon says these inspectors look for the smallest hazard (hazard ).  A “hazard” is something that is dangerous, something that can physically hurt you.  For example, you might have some electrical cords on the floor that you could hurt yourself by tripping over.  These would be considered a s afety hazard, something that could hurt someone.  The inspectors look for safety  hazards that would be remotely dangerous.  “Remotely,” here, means a little b it, slightly or barely, not very much but just enough: “remotely dangerous.”

Lon says, “If we get cited (cited), we may be shut down.”   To be “cited,” here, means to be told officially that you are breaking the l aw, that you are doing something against the law, to be told that you are bre aking a rule.  It’s an official declaration – an official statement.  Often, they will give you a piece of paper which is called a “citation.”  To be “cited” has a couple of different in English, however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

So, Lon is worried about the safety inspectors citing the company, giving them official notice that they are breaking the law, and tha t might lead to then being shut down.  To “shut something down,” or to “shut down”  something is a two- word phrasal verb meaning, in this case, to make the busin ess or the organization close so that it can no longer operate.  Th ey would close your business, that would be to shut the business down.

Abigail says, “With all due respect.”  That expression, “wi th all due respect,” is used when you want to say something that disagrees with w hat someone else has said.  So, you are going to disagree with someone, but you don’t want to hurt that person’s feelings.  You want to do it politely, i n a nice way.  This is often used when you have a more or less serious disagreement with  someone: “With all due respect, I think you’re an idiot.”  That’s what  my professors used to say at the university!

Abigail is much nicer, she says, “With all due respect, I d on’t think that’s how it works.”  She’s saying that Lon is wrong.  “Yes,” she says, “t he inspector will look at our work environment (the place where they work) and our gear and machinery.”  “Gear” (gear) is typically the equipment tha t you use for a job; it could also be the clothing that you wear.  “Machinery” re fers to equipment that’s normally used to “manufacturer,” or make something, to produce something – something physical, that would be a piece of machinery.  So, gear and machinery are going to be inspected by the inspectors to make sure th ere are no hazards or

 toxic substances.  Something that is “toxic” (toxic) means it is poisonous.  It is a chemical usually, that is dangerous for your health; it can  make you very sick.

Lon says, “That’s what I’m worried about.”  He’s worried  about the inspectors finding something.  Abigail says, “But, if they find a vi olation,” an instance where they have broken the law, or broken the rules and regula tions, they will have “a chance to fix the problem.”  That is, the company will be  able to fix the problem before the government agency tells them to shut down.  She says, “They won’t shut us down without giving us a chance to comply with the ir safety standards.” To “comply with” something means to obey a law or a rul e or a regulation, to do something that you are being told to do.  They are go ing to have a chance to comply with the “safety standards.”  Those are the actual r ules that the government has for companies.  Usually they are specific ru les that’s say you have to do so much or you have to have a certain amount  of something.  A “standard” is usually the minimum that you need to do to be able to pass inspection.

Lon says, “I sure hope you’re right.”  Abigail says, “Me,  too (I, as well).”  But we don’t normally say “I, as well,” we would say more infor mally, “me, too.”  Abigail says, “We’ll know after next week’s inspection”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lon:  What’s this?

Abigail:  It’s a memo about a safety inspection scheduled  for next week.

Lon:  A safety inspection?  How are we ever going to pa ss a safety inspection?

Abigail:  What do you mean?  This isn’t an unsafe workpl ace.  We’ve had a good record.  None of our employees have had on-the-job inju ries this year and we’ve never had a fatality.  I don’t understand why you’re so worried.

# Internet Dating

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 21: Internet Dating.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 421.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful, sunny Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can download a L earning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension qu estions, free money, and a complete transcript of this episode.  Well, there’s no  free money, but there is all the rest of that!

This episode is called “Internet Dating.”  It’s about fi nding love on the Internet. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kevin:  I know a lot of people are doing it, but I’m not so sure about trying an Internet dating service.

Eun:  What do you have to lose?  This website says that it screens all of its members.  Let’s look at some of the profiles.

Kevin:  All right.  We have to select the criteria for  a search.  Let’s see...gender – “female”; location – “Los Angeles”; age range – “26 t o 35.”

Eun:  Wow, you got 243 hits.  I think you’d better na rrow down the search criteria.

Kevin:  Okay, I’ll search for people who live within a 5 0-mile radius.  That gives us 72 hits.

Eun:  Click on that one.  Let’s see.  This woman is 29 an d she’s an accountant. She’s very pretty.

Kevin:  Do you think people would upload any photos tha t weren’t flattering?

 Eun:  Still, I think she’s promising, don’t you?  Anyway,  who doesn’t tell a few white lies in their dating profile?  It’s not like you ’re misrepresenting yourself.  If you sign up for a trial membership, you’ll have to do the same thing.

Kevin:  Will I?  What will I need to lie about?

Eun:  Nothing, nothing.  You’re perfect just the way yo u are.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Kevin saying to Eun, “I know a lot of people are doing it, but I’m not so sure about trying an Internet dating ser vice.”  He says he’s “not so sure,” that means he has doubts, he doesn’t know if thi s is a good idea.  An “Internet dating service” is an online business that helps you find and meet other people you may be romantically interested in.

Eun says, “What do you have to lose?”  This expression, “what  do you have to lose,” means that you should do something because nothing  bad can happen as a result.  It isn’t going to hurt you in anyway: “What d o you have to lose?”  This is sometimes said when someone, perhaps, is in a desperate situation, in a situation where they don’t have a lot of other options and doing something will be better than doing nothing.

Eun says, “This website says that it screens all of its member s.”  To “screen,” as a verb, here means to review or to look at something and  decide if it is acceptable or if it is good enough.  If you go into a co mpany the company will screen the people who want to work there – the people  who are applying for the job.  They will look at their information and decide who they want to interview, for example.  “Screen” has a couple of different meanings in  English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Eun suggests to Kevin that they look at some of the profil es.  A “profile” is usually a short description that gives some general information a bout something, especially a person or a company.  So, on these Internet d ating sites they have profiles of different people that describe them in a g eneral way.  Kevin says, “All right (okay).  We have to select the criteria for a sear ch.”  “Criteria” is the plural for the noun “criterion” (criterion).  A “criterion” i s something that you use judge someone or some other thing, some sort of rule or standa rd that you use to decide if something is good enough or not.  So for exam ple, if you are applying

 for a job one of the criteria may be that you have a co llege degree (you graduated from college).  That’s an example of “criteri a.”

Well, Kevin says they have to select the criteria for a sea rch.  To “search” for something is to look for something, so when we are on the Internet we can search for things.  In this case, Kevin is searching for h is love, his true love, somewhere out there in the world.  Kevin gives some crite ria.  He begins with gender – male or female, Kevin is looking for a female ; location – here in Los Angeles; and finally age range.  The “range” of someth ing is the highest and lowest values or number of something.  “Age range” refe rs to the ages of the people, in this case, that Kevin is looking for.  So the age range, for example, for those who go to high school in the United States would be 14 to 18, from 14 years old up to 18 years old.  Kevin is looking for women  between the ages of 26 and 35; that’s his age range.  Men often look for wome n who are their age or younger, and this is, perhaps, the case with Kevin.  We do n’t know.  Kevin could be an old person – 45, for example, like me, looking for a younger woman.  Well, not me, Kevin!

Back to the story: Eun says, “Wow, you got 243 hits.”  A “hi t,” when you are talking about searching for something, is finding someth ing that meets your criteria (that fits your criteria).  So if you put in,  for example, ESL Podcast and you search in a search engine, such as Google, the first h it (the first link) you will see on the page is for ESL Podcast, this podcast.  That’s a “hit.”  “Hit” has several meanings in English – different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.

So Eun says that Kevin got 243 women who live in Los Ange les between the ages of 26 and 35 who are registered on this Internet dating service.  Eun says, “I think you’d better narrow down the search criteria. ”  To “narrow down” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to become more specific in wha t you are looking for, to be more specific.  In this case, he has to find more s pecific criteria so that there are fewer hits; he has too many, right now.

Kevin says, “Okay, I’ll search for people who live within a 50-mile radius.” “Radius” (radius) is the distance between the middle of  a circle and the edge of the circle.  It’s used here to specify or to describe an are a around where, in this case, Kevin lives.  So a “50-mile radius” would be anythin g that would be 50 miles from Kevin’s house, or anyone.  When he does that, he gets 72 hits – 72 women who live within 50 miles of his house.

 Eun says, “Click on that one.”  She’s selects one and says, “Le t’s see.  This woman is 29 and she’s an accountant.”  She works in a busin ess where she takes care of the money, figuring out how much money the company has, for example.  “She’s very pretty,” Eun says.  Kevin says, “Do you th ink people would upload any photos that weren’t flattering?”  “Flatter ing,” as an adjective, means attractive, something that makes you look attractive.  So what Kevin is asking here is, well, of course the picture that the woman pu ts on the website is beautiful, because everyone would put the most beautiful  photograph of themselves they could find.  It’s clear that Kevin is a lit tle “skeptical,” that is, he has some doubts about whether this woman really is very pre tty.

Eun says, “Still (meaning even though, despite what you say), I think she’s promising.”  When something is “promising,” here we me an it has a lot of potential to be good or useful.  It’s something that se ems good or interesting, but you’re not quite sure – you’re not certain, but it loo ks good.  Eun says this woman looks promising.  “Anyway,” she says (in any case), “who doesn ’t tell a few white lies in their dating profile?”  A “white lie” is a sm all or unimportant lie, something that isn’t true but it isn’t serious.  So for example, i f you meet a woman and you say to her, “I’m five feet, 10 inches,” when you’re reall y five feet, nine inches. Well, that’s a “white lie,” you want to make yourself se em taller.  But if you tell her that you are single when, in fact, you are married, wel l, that would be a little bit more than a white lie!

So, Eun is saying that people sometimes don’t tell the co mplete truth in their dating profiles on these Internet websites.  Eun says, “It ’s not like you’re misrepresenting yourself.”  To “misrepresent” means to s ay something to make someone believe that thing, but it isn’t true.  So if I said I’m single, when in reality I’m married – and I am married – then that would be  misrepresenting myself.  I would be essentially telling someone something that wasn ’t true.

Well, Eun says that a few white lies (a few exaggeratio ns) isn’t the same as misrepresenting yourself.  She then says, “If you sign up for a trial membership, you’ll have to do the same thing.”  If you “sign up,” i f you become a member, you will have to do the same thing.  Some websites offer wh at is called a “trial (trial) membership,” which is where you can sign up for the membe rship for a week or a month, some period of time, to see if you like it, a nd then if you like it you can continue to use it by paying for it.

Kevin says, “Will I?” meaning will it be necessary for me,  also, to tell some white lies.  “What will I need to lie about?”  Eun says, “No thing, nothing.  You’re perfect

 just the way you are.”  Of course, Eun doesn’t really be lieve that, but she wants Kevin to think that he’s perfect.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kevin:  I know a lot of people are doing it, but I’m not so sure about trying an Internet dating service.

Eun:  What do you have to lose?  This website says that it screens all of its members.  Let’s look at some of the profiles.

Kevin:  All right.  We have to select the criteria for  a search.  Let’s see...gender – “female”; location – “Los Angeles”; age range – “26 t o 35.”

Eun:  Wow, you got 243 hits.  I think you’d better na rrow down the search criteria.

Kevin:  Okay, I’ll search for people who live within a 5 0-mile radius.  That gives us 72 hits.

# Shopping for Underwear

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 22: Shopping for Underwear.

The Learning Guide is an 8 to 10 page file that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional def initions, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a complete transcript of thi s entire episode.

This episode is called “Shopping for Underwear.”  Everyo ne – well, almost every one wears underwear, and this is a dialogue that gives yo u some vocabulary about buying underwear for both men and women.  Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kerry:  We’re almost done with the shopping.  We just n eed some underwear for you and some unmentionables for me.

Russell:  It’s perfectly acceptable for women to buy men’s u nderwear, but do I have to go into the lingerie store?  All of the women  in the store laugh at me.

Kerry:  No, they don’t.  I just need a few things.  He re we are.  Okay, I need a new bra with underwire, and I need a strapless one, t oo.  Do you see any in a B cup?

Russell:  I’m not helping you look.  I’m standing over h ere where nobody can see me.

Kerry:  Fine.  Let’s see, I need some panties and a slip , too.  Oh, these pantyhose are on sale.

Russell:  Can you please hurry up?  That woman over there  is snickering.

Kerry:  She’s only laughing because you look so uncomfortab le.  Okay, I’m done. Let’s go get your underwear.

 Russell:  Thank God!  I just need some new boxers with a comfortable waistband and a button fly.

Kerry:  I thought you liked the boxer briefs I bought b efore, you know, the seamless ones.

Russell:  I tried them, but they were too small.  I thi nk I’d actually like to try some regular briefs.  Here are some over here.

Kerry:  You’d better look again.  Those are g-strings.  If you insist on buying those, it’ll be my turn to hide.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Kerry saying to Russell, “We’r e almost done with the shopping.  We just need some underwear for you and some unmentionables for me.”  “Underwear” is the clothing you wear underneath your regular clothing.  It’s clothing that you don’t normally see.  Kerry says she needs to get some underwear for Russell and some unmentionables for hersel f.  To “mention” something is to say something.  If you say it is “unmention able” that means that you shouldn’t or don’t say it.  In this case, Kerry is simpl y making a joke, “unmentionables” is just a funny way to refer to underw ear.  The joke is that it’s somehow inappropriate to talk about underwear in a con versation, so she makes a little joke and says “unmentionables.”

Russell says, “It’s perfectly acceptable for women to buy men’ s underwear.”  So, a woman can buy underwear for a man in a store.  “But, ” he says, “do I have to go into the lingerie store?  All of the women in the  store laugh at me.”  So Russell, who’s a man, is embarrassed by going into the wom en’s underwear store.  A women’s underwear story is sometimes called a “l ingerie (lingerie) store.”  “Lingerie” actually refers to women’s underwear , but sometimes it refers also to fancy, expensive, perhaps sexy clothing that a woman m ight wear as underwear.

Russell doesn’t want to go into the lingerie store.  Ke rry says that the women are not laughing at Russell.  She says, “I just need a few th ings,” and they walk into the store.  “Here we are,” she says, “Okay, I need a new bra with underwire, and I need a strapless one, too.”  A “bra” (bra) is a type of underwear that a woman wears; it goes over her shoulders.  They have what are ca lled “straps,” and these straps go over the shoulders, and in the front of the bo dy, the bra is there to

 support the woman’s breasts.  So, it’s the chest of a woma n where you will find a bra.  Men, typically, do not wear bras – most men, the m en I know!

The bra that Kerry is looking for has an underwire.  An  “underwire” is a piece of metal that is sewn into – that is made as part of the b ra to provide extra support for large breasts, shall we say.  Kerry says she also needs a strapless bra. Remember I said that there are these things that go ove r the shoulder, they connect the front of the bra to the back, so they help hold up the breasts.  The “strapless” bras are bras that don’t have this strap goin g over the shoulder. Usually it’s a dress that is strapless or a bra that is strapl ess, so you don’t see anything on the woman’s shoulder.

Kerry then asks Russell, “Do you see any (any bras) in a B cup? ”  A “cup” is a part of the bra that is round and that fits over one b reast.  Cups come in different sizes because, of course, women have different sized breasts, or least that’s what people tell me.  Now that I’m married, I don’t  look at other women any more! The bras come in cups sizes from triple A (AAA), which is t he smallest to triple D (DDD), which is the biggest.  Most women are somewhere i n between there: A cup, B cup, C cup, maybe D cup.  But, well, women come in  all different sizes, so there are all different sizes of bras.  Isn’t this excitin g?!

Now, Russell says, “I’m not helping you look.  I’m standing  over here where nobody can see me.”  So, Russell is embarrassed.  Kerry sa ys, “Fine.  I need some panties and a slip, too.  Oh, these pantyhose are o n sale.”  Kerry says she needs some panties.  “Panties” are the underwear that a woman wears around her waist, over her bottom, and between her legs.  Th at’s “panties.”  We don’t usually call that kind of underwear “panties” for a man , however.  We never do, only for a woman.  A “slip” (slip) is a piece of underwe ar that is like a skirt, and it is supposed be worn under a regular skirt so that you canno t see in between the woman’s legs; it blocks the light.  So, if a woman is wea ring a very thin skirt, she might also wear a slip underneath it to cover up her le gs better.  The word “slip” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a lo ok at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Kerry says she also sees some pantyhose.  “Pantyhose” (one word ) are also called “nylons” (nylons).  They’re a type of clothing that  you put on your legs (a woman puts on her legs).  They are made from a very th in material (a thin fabric, we would say) that you can usually see through; they’re oft en brown or black in color.  A woman wears these over her legs, up to her wa ist.  They’re used to make her legs look smooth and evenly colored, especially when  she is wearing a skirt or a dress.  Often they’re used for more formal occasi ons, as well.

 Russell says, “Can you please hurry up (can you go faster)?   The woman over there is snickering.”  To “snicker” (snicker) means to laugh quietly, usually laughing at another person.  It’s not considered very ni ce to snicker at someone; it’s something that children might do.  They’re laughin g at another person, but not very loudly.  Russell thinks this woman is snickering at him (is laughing at him). Kerry says, “She’s only laughing because you look so uncomfort able.  Okay,” she says, “I’m done (I’m finished).  Let’s go get your underw ear.”

Russell is very happy to be leaving the lingerie store, or the lingerie section of the store.  He says, “I just need some new boxers with a comf ortable waistband and a button fly.”  “Boxers” are a kind of underwear that a  man and wears around his waist.  Most men only wear one kind of underwear, that goes around the middle of their body, their legs (top of their legs), and the ir waist.  “Boxers” is a particular kind of underwear that is loose, that is not tight.  the “waistband” is the part of underwear (either for a man or a woman) or some oth er type of clothing worn around your waist, which is the center of your body.  Thi s is a “expandable” piece of fabric or material, meaning that it will get larg er or smaller depending on how big your waist is.  It helps to keep the clothing from f alling down.  So, you have a waistband on underwear; you may have a waistband on a pa ir of sweat pants. Russell wants a comfortable waistband, one that isn’t too  small, one that isn’t too tight.  He also wants a “button fly.”  A “button” is wh at you use to connect two pieces of clothing.  Usually you have buttons, for example, on the front of a formal shirt.  Your “fly” is the part of a piece of und erwear (for a man) that can be opened and closed.  Men often use the restroom (use the bathroom – the toilet) by standing up.  I think you understand what I mean.  T he fly, then, is used so that a man doesn’t have to take his underwear off when  he wants to use the bathroom.  Russell, then, wants a button fly; he wants a  fly in the front of his underwear that has a button to keep it closed.

Well, Kerry says, “I thought you liked the boxer briefs I b ought you before, the seamless ones.”  “Briefs” are another kind of underwear f or a man.  They are not loose, but they are tight.  “Boxer briefs” is sort of in  between a boxer and a brief. They’re longer pieces of underwear, but they’re still ti ght around the legs as well as around the waist.  “Seamless” means, literally, withou t seams.  A “seam” is typically a line that is created when you sew two pieces of fabric or material together.  Something that is “seamless,” then, is made w ith one single piece of fabric or one single piece of material.

Russell said he tried the boxer briefs, “but they were to o small.  I think I’d actually like to try some regular briefs.”  So, Russell is intereste d in wearing a piece of

 underwear that is usually white, and that is smaller tha n a boxer, and is tight around the legs as well as around the waist.  So, we ha ve three kinds of underwear for men, here.  We have briefs, which are tight around the leg and the waist.  We have boxers, which are tight around the waist  but loose around the legs, and are usually a little longer; they almost look l ike shorts.  And then you have boxer briefs, which is somewhere in between, a combi nation of these two things.  The word “brief” has several different meaning s in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Russell thinks that he has found some briefs in the store,  but Kerry says, “You’d better look again (you better look more carefully).  Tho se are g-strings.”  A “g- string” is a kind of underwear that a woman wears.  It’ s a piece of underwear that doesn’t have any material in the back other than a single  piece of fabric (a single piece of material) that goes up and connects to a very sma ll waistline, so a woman’s behind (a woman’s butt) essentially has no fabric over it.  This is a g- string; some women wear it because they think it’s sexy.  Ag ain, I don’t know! Well, obviously this is not something a man such as Russell wo uld want to buy. That’s why Kerry says, “If you insist on buying those (if you must buy those or say that you have to buy those), it’ll be my turn to hide”  – I’m going to hide because I’ll be embarrassed, just like Russell was embarra ssed going into lingerie store.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue – wasn’t this a fun di alogue?  Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kerry:  We’re almost done with the shopping.  We just n eed some underwear for you and some unmentionables for me.

Russell:  It’s perfectly acceptable for women to buy men’s u nderwear, but do I have to go into the lingerie store?  All of the women  in the store laugh at me.

Kerry:  No, they don’t.  I just need a few things.  He re we are.  Okay, I need a new bra with underwire, and I need a strapless one, t oo.  Do you see any in a B cup?

Russell:  I’m not helping you look.  I’m standing over h ere where nobody can see me.

 Kerry:  Fine.  Let’s see, I need some panties and a slip , too.  Oh, these pantyhose are on sale.

Russell:  Can you please hurry up?  That woman over there  is snickering.

Kerry:  She’s only laughing because you look so uncomfortab le.  Okay, I’m done. Let’s go get your underwear.

Russell:  Thank God!  I just need some new boxers with a comfortable waistband and a button fly.

Kerry:  I thought you liked the boxer briefs I bought b efore, you know, the seamless ones.

Kerry:  You’d better look again.  Those are g-strings.  If you insist on buying those, it’ll be my turn to hide.

# Reading Food Labels

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 23: Reading Food Labels.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 423.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  You can also take a look at our ESL Podcast St ore, as well as our ESL Podcast Blog.

This episode is a dialogue between Wendy and Ichirou.  T hey are going to be talking about something that you will find in most Amer ican grocery stores (food stores), and that is food labels.  The government requir es that many, or most kinds of food have a label on them that gives you inform ation about what is inside the food and other what we would call “nutritional i nformation.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I never read food labels until I started going out wit h Wendy.  She’s studying to be a nutritionist.  When we go grocery shopping, she rea ds every label. ________

Wendy:  You’re not buying that, are you?

Ichirou:  Well, I was thinking about it.  Why?

Wendy:  Each serving size has 30 grams of fat, and 10 of t hose are trans fat. The sodium level is through the roof, and it’s full of carbohydrates.  Do you really want to put that in your body?

Ichirou:  Um, I guess not.

Wendy:  What are these cookies doing in the basket?

Ichirou:  Those are my favorite.  I always get them.  I g ot the low-fat kind, see?

Wendy:  Even so, they’re full of calories.  They may be red uced fat, but they’re not low fat.  You don’t eat this kind of cereal do you?

 Ichirou:  Yeah, I do.

Wendy:  Look at the percent daily values.  You get nearly no nutrients and no dietary fiber, and it’s full of sugar. ________

I really like Wendy, but I’m not sure how long I can take  this.  She has the best of intentions, but will my stomach ever forgive me if I keep going out with her? That’s the question.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ichirou saying “I never read f ood labels until I started going out with Wendy.”  A “food label” is a piece of p aper that has written information about it on a piece of packaging for food.   So, it’s on the outside of the food package where you will find the food label.  He says he never read food labels until he started going out with (until he star ted dating) Wendy.  Wendy’s been studying to be a nutritionist.  A “nutritionist” i s a person whose job it is to help people eat better, so they get better food perha ps because they need to lose weight or for some medical reason.

He says, “When we go grocery shopping (when we go shoppin g for food), Wendy reads every (food) label.”  Then we go into dialogue: Wendy says, “You’re not buying that, are you?”  Obviously, Wendy doesn’t like what  Ichirou is going to buy.  He says, “Well, I was thinking about it (meaning yes , I was planning on it). Why?”  Wendy says, “Each serving size has 30 grams of fat.”  T he “serving size” is the amount of a particular food that should be eate n by one person.  Many foods are sold in large containers, so there’s more than one serving, more than enough needed for one person.  There could be two, or  three, or five or six servings in that package, meaning five or six people would have enough food to eat from that package.

“Each serving size,” Wendy says, “has 30 grams of fat.”  A “ gram” is a unit of measurement for weight.  “Fat” is the oily part of foo ds; fat is a kind of food. Food has protein and carbohydrates, and it also can have f at.  Certain kinds of fat are considered bad for your health, especially satu rated fats and trans fat. Wendy says that there are 10 grams of trans fat in that particular package.  Trans fat is now considered the most unhealthy kind of fat beca use it can increase (or raise) your risk of having a heart attack.

 Wendy says, “The sodium level is through the roof.”  “Sodi um” is another word for salt; it’s the chemical element Na.  “Through the r oof” is an expression that means very high or a very large number.  “The price of ga soline in the U.S. went through the roof last year” – it became very expensive, very high in price.  So, the sodium level is very high in this piece of food and “it’s f ull of carbohydrates.” Remember, we talked about food having different elem ents (different parts).  One element is carbohydrates.  “Carbohydrate” is the part of a food that is used to make energy – that the body uses to make energy.

Well, Wendy says to Ichirou, “Do you really want to put th at in your body?”  Of course, he probably does, but because she is his girlfriend he wants to keep her happy, so he says, “Um, I guess not,” meaning no, I don’t.   Wendy says, “What are these cookies doing in the basket?” meaning why did yo u put cookies in their shopping basket.  A “shopping basket” is a container you use  to put your food in in a store before you pay for it.  It helps you move the food around the store.

Ichirou says, “Those are my favorite (my favorite cookies).  I  always get them.  I got the low-fat kind, see?”  When a food is called “lo w-fat” it means it has only a small amount of fat in it.  Some people try to buy foo d that is low fat because they think it is better for them.  However, Wendy points out the cookies are still “full of calories.”  A “calorie” is a measurement, technically, of t he amount of energy in food.  If you eat more calories you will gain more we ight – if you eat too many calories, I should say.  If you don’t eat enough calories, then you will lose weight. So, when Wendy says the food is full of calories, she mean s they have a lot of calories – too many calories.  Wendy says, “They may be reduce d fat, but they’re not low fat.”  Food that is “low fat” has very little fat in it.  Food that is “reduced fat” has less fat than normal, but more fat than low fat.  So, it’s somewhere between normally and low fat.

Wendy says, “You don’t eat this kind of cereal do you?”  “C ereal” is a food often eaten at breakfast.  Usually it’s small, dry pieces of foo d made from grains, and you put them in a bowl with milk and you eat them with  a spoon.  I have cereal every day for breakfast.  Wendy obviously doesn’t like the cere al that Ichirou eats.  He says, “Yeah, I do,” meaning I do eat that kind  of cereal.  Wendy says, “Look at the percent daily values.”  The “percent daily val ue” is the piece of information found on the food label that tells you t he percentage of the recommended amount of something that people are suppose d to eat every day that is in that particular food.  So, it might say for  example, this bread has a percent daily value of 20 percent for vitamin A.  That m eans this food has about 20 percent of the vitamin A that you will need in any g iven day.  A single serving, typically, has that percentage.

 Wendy says, “You get nearly no nutrients.”  “You get near ly no” means you get almost no nutrients.  A “nutrient” is a vitamin, a mine ral, or another part of the food that you eat that helps you become strong and keeps yo u healthy.  So nutrients are good things.  The food also has “no dieta ry fiber.”  “Dietary fiber,” or simply “fiber,” is a kind of food or part of food then you eat but it cannot be used by the body (the fiber), but it helps keep the food mo ving through your body, and that is dietary fiber’s purpose.  Salads, whole grains – these have, typically, a lot of dietary fiber.  She says the cereal is “full of sugar.”   “Sugar,” sometimes called “sucrose” or “glucose,” is the sweet tasting part of food.   “Sugar” has a couple of different meanings in English, as does the word “fat.”   Take a look at our Learning Guide for additional explanations of both of  these terms.

Ichirou is not sure he wants to continue dating Wendy.  He says, “I really like Wendy, but I’m not sure how long I can take this.”  Whe n we say we “can take” something, we mean we are able to continue doing this,  listening to this, without becoming angry or upset.  It means to tolerate somethin g – to “take” something. “I can’t take this music” – I can’t tolerate this music, I  cannot listen to this music anymore.  He says Wendy “has the best of intentions, but wi ll my stomach ever forgive me if I keep going out with her?”  The expressio n “the best of intentions” means that the person wants to do something well; they want to do something that is good, but that’s not actually what they do.  You r “intention” is your desire, what you want to happen, but sometimes our intentions a re not the same as what we actually do.  Wendy has the best of intentions, she “me ans well” we might also say, but poor Ichirou doesn’t think he can continue g oing out with her because she keeps criticizing the kind of food that he eats.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

I never read food labels until I started going out wit h Wendy.  She’s studying to be a nutritionist.  When we go grocery shopping, she rea ds every label. ________

Wendy:  You’re not buying that, are you?

# Being in Debt

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 24: Being in Debt.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 424.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, in the State of Cal ifornia, in the country of the U.S.A.

This episode is a dialogue between Chang and Ilya about  being in debt (owing other people money), which is a common phenomenon (a com mon situation) nowadays.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chang:  I don’t mean to be nosey, but all of those bi lls are red or pink.  Are you behind on all of those bills?

Ilya:  I am, but it’s no big deal.  I can catch up on th em next month.

Chang:  You know that being late on bills is bad for your credit score, right?  You also have to pay exorbitant interest if you have credit ca rd debt.

Ilya:  Don’t worry about it.  Everything will be fine.

Chang:  I’m only speaking from experience.  When I first started working, I had a loan that I defaulted on and I ran up my credit cards.   I had to borrow money from my family and friends to pay my bills.  I was so desperate at one point, I even went to see a loan shark.

Ilya:  Did he lend you money?

Chang:  I decided against borrowing money from him aft er talking to my brother about it.  With his help, I found a good credit counse lor and got my finances under control.  My two main creditors agreed to defer p ayment for a couple of months, but not before I sold my car and most of what I owned to raise money.

 Ilya:  Maybe I can do that.

Chang:  Do what?

Ilya:  Work with a credit counselor so I don’t have to p ay my bills.

Chang:  You’ve got it all wrong.  It took me years to p ay off those bills.  I just didn’t have debt collectors calling me at all hours of the day, that’s all.  A little advice: A little restraint now will save you a lot of pai n.

Ilya:  Okay, okay.  I got the message.  Remind me never to  pay my bills in front of you again!

[end of dialogue]

Chang begins by saying “I don’t mean to be nosey.”  To b e “nosey” (nosey) means that you are asking questions about something that d oes not concern you; it’s not any of your business, we would say.  It’s not something you should be asking about.  But Chang asks anyway.  He says, “all of t hose bills are pink or red.”  In the U.S., when you are late paying your bill , say from the telephone company or the gas company, they will send you a bill, but  the ink will be in pink or red.  That means that you are late.

So, Ilya’s bills are all red or pink.  Chang says, “Are you  behind on all of those bills?”  To be “behind on” something is an expression whi ch means to be behind schedule, to be doing things later than when you shoul d be doing them.  So if the bill is due on October first and you don’t send it in un til October 15th, you are behind on your bills.

Ilya says, “I am (I am behind), but it’s no big deal (it ’s not important).  I can catch up on them next month (I can get back to where I should be next month).” Chang says, “You know that being late on bills is bad for  your credit score, right?” Here in the U.S., there are organizations that keep tr ack of how good you are in making your payments, and they give you a score which the ba nks will use.  If, for example, you want to get a loan, you have to have a good “credit score,” a good credit history.  You have to show that you pay your b ills on time.

Chang says, “You also have to pay exorbitant interest if you  have credit card debt.”  “Exorbitant” (exorbitant) means a number or an  amount of money that is much higher than normal, much higher than it should be , too high.  “Interest” is

 the amount of additional money that you have to pay whe n you borrow money from someone else.  It’s the price of that money that you  are borrowing.  If you borrow $1,000 from the bank at 10 percent interest, you  have to give the bank $1,100 (one thousand, one hundred dollars) back to pay f or the loan and the interest.  “Credit card debt” is when you owe some mone y to usually Visa or MasterCard or American Express or another credit card comp any.  “Debt,” in general” is money you owe to other people.

Ilya says, “Don’t worry about it.  Everything will be fine .”  Chang says, “I’m only speaking from experience.”  The expression to “speak from experience” means to give someone advice or tell someone how something works based upon your own experience with that situation.  Chang says, “When I first started working, I had a loan that I defaulted on and I ran up my credit  cards.”  A “loan” is the money that someone gives you, a bank or a person.  To “de fault” on a loan means not to make the payments that you are supposed to ma ke.  So if you borrow $1,000 and have to pay it back in 10 months, you w ould pay $100 a month – plus interest, of course.  To default on your l oan is to miss one of your payments or two of your payments.  This, of course, can cause  problems for you.

Chang also says he ran up his credit card.  To “run up” so mething means to spend a lot of money or to use a lot of something that one has to pay a lot.  So, “I ran up my credit card” means I charged a lot of things on  my credit cards.  Chang says, “I had to borrow (I had to ask someone for) money f rom my family and friends to pay my bills.  I was so desperate (I was so in a difficult situation) at one point, I even went to see a loan shark.”  A “loan shark” (shark) is someone who lends other people money but charges a very high intere st, and when those people don’t pay the money back they might use violence (or  hurt you) if you don’t pay them back.  That would be a “loan shark.”

Ilya said, “Did he (did the loan shark, and she’s assumin g it was a man – could have been a woman) – did he lend you money?”  To “lend ” means to give someone money or to give someone something else with the  understanding that that person will give that back to you.  “Lend” has a cou ple of different meanings in English, as does the expression to “run up.”  Where can  you find more information?  That’s right, our Learning Guide!

Chang says, “I decided against borrowing money (from the  loan shark) after talking to my brother about it.  With his help, I foun d a good credit counselor and got my finances under control.”  A “credit counselor” is a person who helps someone with a lot of debt, especially credit card debt , to fix the problem. Usually they make an agreement (an arrangement) with the different companies,

 and they help the person pay back the money.  They don’t give them the money, but they help the person be organized and to come up wi th a plan to pay their debts off (to pay them back).

“My two main creditors,” Chang says, “agreed to defer pa yment for a couple of months.”  Your “creditor” is the person or organization to whom you owe money; it’s the person who lends you money.  Could be a bank, c ould be another person. To “defer” something means to wait until later before  you do it.  We might also say to “put it off,” to do it later than when it was o riginally scheduled.  So, Chang was deferring payment, he was going to pay them later than he was supposed to, but he had to sell his car and most of what he owned t o raise money.  To “raise money” means to get money for a specific purpose, usually fr om different sources.  You might work, you might ask somebody for anothe r loan; all of these would be ways of getting money (of raising money).

So, Ilya says, “Maybe I can do that.”  And Chang says, “Do what?” meaning what can you do.  Ilya says, “I can work with a credit counselor so I don’t have to pay my bills.”  Well, of course, this is not what a credit co unselor does.  Chang says, “You’ve got it all wrong,” meaning you are completely incorrect.  He says, “It took me years to pay off those bills.”  To “pay off” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to give the money back to someone who has lent you money.  Chang says, “I just didn’t have debt collectors calling me at all hours of the day.”  So, going to the credit counselor stopped the debt collectors from calling him.  A “debt collector” is a person or company whose job it is to get you to pay your bills, and what they’ll do is they’ll call you, and keep calling you, to remind you  to pay your bills.

Chang says, “A little advice: A little restraint now will  save you a lot of pain,” meaning a lot of pain later.  “Restraint” is when you  don’t do something even though you could.  To “show restraint” means I’m not going to do something even though I could do it for some higher reason (for some  better reason).

Ilya says, “Okay, okay.  I got the message (I understand).  Re mind me never to pay my bills in front of you again!”  Of course, Ilya didn ’t really get the message, did she?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Chang:  I don’t mean to be nosey, but all of those bi lls are red or pink.  Are you behind on all of those bills?

 Ilya:  I am, but it’s no big deal.  I can catch up on th em next month.

Chang:  You know that being late on bills is bad for your credit score, right?  You also have to pay exorbitant interest if you have credit ca rd debt.

Ilya:  Don’t worry about it.  Everything will be fine.

Chang:  I’m only speaking from experience.  When I first started working, I had a loan that I defaulted on and I ran up my credit cards.   I had to borrow money from my family and friends to pay my bills.  I was so desperate at one point, I even went to see a loan shark.

Ilya:  Did he lend you money?

Chang:  I decided against borrowing money from him aft er talking to my brother about it.  With his help, I found a good credit counse lor and got my finances under control.  My two main creditors agreed to defer p ayment for a couple of months, but not before I sold my car and most of what I owned to raise money.

Ilya:  Maybe I can do that.

Chang:  Do what?

Ilya:  Work with a credit counselor so I don’t have to p ay my bills.

Chang:  You’ve got it all wrong.  It took me years to p ay off those bills.  I just didn’t have debt collectors calling me at all hours of the day, that’s all.  A little advice: A little restraint now will save you a lot of pai n.

Ilya:  Okay, okay.  I got the message.  Remind me never to  pay my bills in front of you again!

# Serving Drinks and Cocktails

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 25: Serving Drinks and Cocktails.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 425.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  On it you can find a Learning  Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is a dialogue between Spencer and Heidi t alking about making alcoholic, for the most part, drinks.  They’ll use a lot of common vocabulary, and talk about some specific kinds of popular drinks in the U. S.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Spencer:  I’m practicing making drinks for the party tonig ht.  Do you want to try one?

Heidi:  You’re the bartender?  I didn’t know you knew how to mix drinks.

Spencer:  I can hold my own.  Okay, name it and I’ll ma ke it – any mixed drink or cocktail.

Heidi:  Okay, I’ll have a Screwdriver.

Spencer:  A Screwdriver?  Hmm…what’s in that?

Heidi:  Aren’t you supposed to know, Mr. Bartender?

Spencer:  I’ve never made one of those before, that’s al l.  Try something else.

Heidi:  How about a Bloody Mary?

Spencer:  A Bloody Mary, a Bloody Mary…do you want that on  the rocks?

Heidi:  Sure, that’ll be great.

Spencer:  Here you are – a Bloody Mary in a highball.  Enjoy!

 Heidi:  [Makes a gagging sound]  This doesn’t taste like a  Bloody Mary.  It tastes like you poured an entire bottle of alcohol into this.

Spencer:  Oh, come on.  It’s not that bad.  Here, I’ll  add a little soda, and oh, I forgot the garnish.

Heidi:  I don’t think that’s going to help.  Can I gi ve you some advice?  Stick to shots and drinks served straight up.

Spencer:  Ah, don’t lose faith in me.  Let me make you one more drink.

Heidi:  Okay, but make it virgin.  My mouth is still on fi re from the last one.

[end of dialogue]

Spencer begins our dialogue by telling Heidi “I’m pract icing making drinks for the party tonight.  Do you want to try one?”  Heidi asks, “Y ou’re the bartender?”  The “bartender” is the person whose job it is to make alcohol ic drinks at a party, or in a restaurant, or at a bar.  Heidi says, “I didn’t know yo u knew how to mix drinks.” “Mix drinks,” here, to make special, usually alcoholic, drin ks by mixing different kinds alcohol, soda, and, or perhaps, juice.  Sometimes we  refer those kind of drinks with the noun “mixed drinks.”  But here, it’s used as a verb meaning to make the drinks, to prepare the drinks.

Spencer says, “I can hold my own.”  To “hold your own” is a n expression that means to be able to do something just as well as other  people can do it.  “I can hold my own” – I’m as good as other people.  Spencer says,  “Okay, name it,” meaning tell me what kind of drink you want.  Both “to  hold your own” and “name it” have a couple of different meanings in English; ta ke a look at our Learning Guide for more information.

Spencer says, “I’ll make any mixed drink,” notice here it’s u sed as a noun: a mixed drink, “or cocktail.”  A “cocktail” (cocktail) is just ano ther name for a mixed drink; a mixed drink and cocktail are the same thing, peo ple use both names.

Heidi says, “Okay, I’ll have a Screwdriver.”  A “screwdriver” normally is a tool that you use with little pieces of metal called “screws.”  But h ere, it’s an alcoholic drink, a popular one, that is made vodka and orange ju ice.  Spencer says, “A Screwdriver?  Hmm…what’s in that?”  Well, Screwdriver is p robably the easiest drink you can make; almost everyone knows what a Screwdriver is, at least

 anyone who goes to bars and restaurants.  So, Spencer not  knowing is a good indication that he’s not very good.

Heidi says, “Aren’t you supposed to know, Mr. Bartender?”  – isn’t it your job to know?  Notice she calls him “Mr. Bartender.”  This is somet imes used as a joke when you call someone by their job or occupation, so you mi ght say to me, “Mr. Podcaster.”  It’s usually used sort of as a joke often whe n people say they know something but, in fact, they don’t.

Spencer says, “I’ve never made one of those (one of those Screwdrivers) before, that’s all.  Try something else.”  So Heidi gives him an other drink: “How about a Bloody Mary?”  A “Bloody Mary” is a drink made from vodka,  tomato juice, and usually some spices to give it a certain flavor.  But basical ly, vodka and tomato juice is a Bloody Mary, again, a very simple drink.

Spencer seems to know how to make it, and he asks Heidi if she wanted it on the rocks.  The expression “on the rocks” (rocks) means with ice.  W e use this expression when we are talking about beverages (drinks).  S ome people, for example, like to drink whisky, and they like the whisky to be poured onto some ice cubes in a glass.  That would be whisky on the rocks.  If  you don’t want ice in your drinks, you would tell the bartender you want it “ straight up.”  Straight up: “Give me a whisky straight up” – no ice, just the whisky.

Well, Spencer gives her the Bloody Mary on the rocks, and h e says, “Here you go” or “Here you are – a Bloody Mary in a highball.”  A “highball” is a type of glass, a tall glass that is often used for alcoholic beverag es.  In some parts of the country, a highball is a name of a drink.  It’s a drink w ith brandy or whisky mixed with either some sort of soda or water, but here it ju st means a glass.

Heidi says, “This doesn’t taste like a Bloody Mary.  It taste s like you poured (you put) an entire bottle of alcohol into this.”  Spencer says, “Oh, come on.”  That expression is used when you are telling somebody not to com plain, or to stop saying what they are saying because it’s wrong or it’s exagge rated.  He says, “Oh, come on.  It’s not that bad” – it’s not very bad o r as bad as you say.  He says, “Here, I’ll add a little soda.”  “Soda,” when you are talking about drinks, usually means “carbonated water,” that is water that ha s little bubbles in it.  If you’re not talking about alcoholic drinks, soda can refer t o what is called in some parts of the country “soda pop,” things like Coca-Cola or Pepsi.  In Minnesota, where I’m from, everyone just says “pop,” so you’ll say “C an I have a pop?” Whereas here in California, and in most other places, yo u would ask for a soda if

 you wanted, say, a Coca-Cola or something similar.  In m aking alcoholic drinks a soda, or what’s sometimes called “soda water,” is a carbona ted water.

Spencer says, “oh, I forgot the garnish.”  “Garnish” is som ething that’s used to decorate your plate of food or your drink.  It isn’t r eally part of the drink; it’s just something that’s supposed to make it look nice.

Heidi says, “I don’t think that’s going to help.”  She sa ys, “Can I give you some advice?  Stick to shots and drinks served straight up.”  A “sho t” is a small amount of alcohol.  There are actually little glasses which we cal l “shot glasses,” where you can pour alcohol into.  You can use it to measure the alcohol, or you can just drink the alcohol right from the shot glass; these are cal led “shots.”  “Give me a shot of whisky.”  Sometimes especially younger people when t hey are in a bar and perhaps not experienced with drinking, or want to g et drunk, will “do shots,” that is they will drink a lot of shots of alcohol so they can get intoxicated.  This has never happened to me, but I’ve seen other people do  it.  The expression “stick to” something means do something that is very basic, or  do only this, continue doing that and don’t try to do anything more  complicated.  So, I do audio podcasts.  If I were to start doing video podcasts (with the exception of our anniversary videos, of course), someone might say, “Jeff, you’r e not very good at that.  Stick to audio podcasts” – continue doing the simpl er thing because you don’t know enough to do the more complicated thing.  T hat’s what Heidi is saying to Spencer here.

Spencer says, “don’t lose faith in me,” meaning don’t st op having confidence in me, continue to believe in me.  “Don’t lose faith in m e.  Let me make you one more drink,” he says.  Heidi says, “Okay, but make it virgin.   My mouth is still on fire (is still hot) from the last one.”  A “virgin” dri nk is a drink without any alcohol, but it has all of the other ingredients.  So it looks l ike a regular drink but, in fact, there is no alcohol in the drink.  A “virgin,” here, me ans untouched.  The term, of course, also refers to a woman or a man who has never had  sexual relations.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Spencer:  I’m practicing making drinks for the party tonig ht.  Do you want to try one?

Heidi:  You’re the bartender?  I didn’t know you knew how to mix drinks.

 Spencer:  I can hold my own.  Okay, name it and I’ll ma ke it – any mixed drink or cocktail.

Heidi:  Okay, I’ll have a Screwdriver.

# Talking About Product Quality

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 26: Talking About Product Quality.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 426.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Brenda and Yoji tal king about product quality, the quality of things that you buy.  Are they go od, are they bad; what are some of the specific words we use in describing different  products – different things – we’ll find out in this dialogue.  Let’s get st arted.

[start of dialogue]

Brenda:  It’s fun shopping for a new cell phone, don’t  you think?

Yoji:  Sure, but I just need one with the bare basics.

Brenda:  Not me.  I want one that’s top-of-the-line.   My old phone was cheap and flimsy, and it started acting up after only a few months.

Yoji:  I want something that’s good quality, but I don ’t think I should have to pay top dollar for it, especially since I don’t need the bel ls and whistles.

Brenda:  The bells and whistles are the best part!

Yoji:  I like this one.  It seems sturdy and it should la st me for years.

Brenda:  That is one ugly phone!

Yoji:  I don’t care about its looks.  I just want someth ing functional and that won’t fall apart.

Brenda:  I’m not arguing for style over substance, but t hat phone is hideous.

Yoji:  I’ll get over it.

 Brenda:  Yes, but I’m not sure I will!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Brenda saying, “It’s fun shoppi ng for a new cell phone, don’t you think?”  Notice she says “don’t you think,” this i mplies that the other person will probably agree with her.  Yoji says, “Sure,  but I just need one with the bare basics” – I just need to buy a cell phone that has the bare basics.  The “bare basics” would be the simplest version of something, somethi ng that only has the absolute necessities on it, things that you would need an d nothing more.

Yoji says that he wants a cell phone with the bare basics.  Brenda says, “Not me. I want one that’s top-of-the-line.”  The expression “ top-of-the-line” refers to the best possible or the best available thing – the one wit h the highest quality, the fanciest perhaps, often the most expensive one.  Brenda says, “My old phone was cheap and flimsy.”  When we describe a product as “cheap ,” we mean it’s poor quality.  “Cheap” can also mean not very much mone y, not very expensive – “inexpensive,” we would say.  That’s if you’re using “cheap”  to describe a thing. If you’re using “cheap” to describe a person, then it’s a n insulting, negative way to describe someone who doesn’t like to spend money: “He’s cheap, he won’t take me out to dinner,” said my ex girlfriend!

Brenda says her old phone was cheap and flimsy (flimsy).  So mething that is “flimsy” is very poor quality.  It’s something that will br eak very easily, or something that is easy to damage.  Brenda says her phone st arted acting up after only a few months.  To “act up,” is a two-word ph rasal verb meaning to have problems or to create problems.  Here, it means really t o stop functioning properly, to stop working the way it should.  If you have  a watch and the watch stops because it’s broken, you might say that it is acting up – it stopped working.

Yoji says, “I want something that’s good quality (meaning  I want something that is well made), but I don’t think I should have to pay t op dollar for it.”  The expression “top dollar” means a very high price, very expensi ve.  Top dollar – the highest amount you could pay for something.  He says that “ I don’t need the bells and whistles” in his new phone.  The expression “bells and  whistles” can be used for any product, anything you buy, usually a piece of techn ology or electronics that has many different features, many complicated, perha ps, or fancy things.  It does a lot of things besides the bare basic functions.  The  cell phone, for example, that has a camera, an MP3 player, where you ca n surf the Internet – this would be a cell phone with a lot of bells and whi stles.  Literally, a “bell” is

 something that you ring [sound of a bell], that’s what a bell is.  A “whistle” is something that you would blow to make a very high pitche d sound.  In a American football game, for example, the referees (the  people who make sure that players are following the rules) have whistles which  they blow so that the players can hear them.

Brenda says, “The bells and whistles (the fancy stuff) are the best part!”  Yoji says, “I like this one.  It seems sturdy and it should last m e for years.”  To describe something as “sturdy” (sturdy) means that it will n ot break, that it is strong and reliable.  It’s the opposite of “flimsy.”  B renda says, “That is one ugly phone!”  This is a common informal expression: “that is one (something).”  It’s an expression we use to give emphasis; it’s used to show that the following statement or the following expression is true.  For examp le, you go to a restaurant and you buy a hamburger, and the hamburger costs you 25 dollars. Your friend might say, “That’s one expensive hamburger!”   You’re saying it’s definitely true it’s an expensive hamburger.

Well, Brenda is saying that’s one ugly phone, meaning it ’s very ugly.  Yoji says, “I don’t care about its looks.”  “Looks” as a noun refers to t he physical appearance of something, the way something is viewed by other peopl e.  We often use the word “looks” in talking about a person’s physical appearan ce, but it can be used to talk about a thing – an object.  There are a couple  of different meanings of this word; take a look at our Learning Guide for some addi tional explanations.

Yoji says, “I just want something functional and that won ’t fall apart.”  “Functional” means that it is working correctly; it is able to do what it is supposed to do.  The phrasal verb “to fall apart” means to break, usually to  break into many smaller pieces.  It could also be used just to mean to stop workin g properly.  “The children were building a house of cards (with playing ca rds – little pieces of paper), but then it fell apart” – it fell down; it broke into all the individual pieces.

Brenda says, “I’m not arguing for style over substance, but  that phone is hideous.”  The expression “style over substance” refers to so mething that is very beautiful but it doesn’t work well, something that w as made by people who are more interested in the appearance (in the way it looks)  than what it can actually do.  So, you could have a beautiful watch for example, b ut if you can’t read it (if you can’t see what time it is) that’s not very useful, no t very functional.  Brenda is saying she doesn’t want something just because it looks good;  it also has to work.  “But,” she says, “that phone (the one Yoji wants) is hideous.”  “Hideous” (hideous) means very ugly, extremely unattractive.  It’s a ve ry negative way to

 describe something or, certainly, someone.  Sometimes in formally it also is used just to mean terrible or very bad, but usually it means ve ry ugly.

Yoji says, “I’ll get over it.”  To “get over” something is a phrasal verb meaning to accept something is bad – something bad has happened, bu t to continue on with your normal life, to keep living without worrying about  this bad thing.  If you had a car accident and you hurt your neck, eventually you will, we  hope, get over it. You will recover, you will continue with your life as no rmal.  This expression is sometimes used in a more negative way.  If someone says to  you, “Oh, get over it!” that expression means you need to stop worrying abo ut that, something that the other person doesn’t think is very important.  So for example if it’s raining and you are complaining to your friend, you are saying all the time “Oh, it’s raining. It’s so wet.  I hate this,” your friend may say to you “Ge t over it!”  Stop worrying about it; just go on with your life.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Brenda:  It’s fun shopping for a new cell phone, don’t  you think?

Yoji:  Sure, but I just need one with the bare basics.

Brenda:  Not me.  I want one that’s top-of-the-line.   My old phone was cheap and flimsy, and it started acting up after only a few months.

# Planning a Protest

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 27: Planning a Protest.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 427.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can download a L earning Guide for this episode, an 8 to 10 page guide that will help you im prove your English even faster.  You can also take look at our ESL Podcast Store,  which has some additional courses in business and daily English you may be i nterested in.

Our topic today is “Planning a Protest,” when you want t o tell people that you are against something in public.  This is a dialogue between  Becky and Pedro, and we’ll listen to them discuss some common problems – some comm on issues when you are having a protest.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Becky:  I want to thank all of you for coming today.  I th ink we all agree that we need to organize a protest…

Pedro:  Hold on, Becky.  We all want to voice our opinio n that we oppose what is going on here, but I’m not sure a protest is the answer .

Becky:  With all due respect, Pedro, I think a rally is the  best way to do that.

Pedro:  That may be, but I think we need to consider a  few things first.  Taking to the streets means coordinating a lot of people.  That m eans getting them to show up, to march, and to hold up signs.  I’m not sure we ha ve enough time to pull it all off.

Becky:  Don’t get me wrong.  I’m not in favor of doing anything half-assed.  If we decide to protest, we want to do it right so that we g et a lot of media coverage. I’m confident that we have enough people and time to get it all done.

Pedro:  Okay, but another thing we should be ready for is a counter protest.  The other side isn’t going to take things lying down.

 Becky:  You’re right, and we’ll take that into considerat ion.  Is there any more discussion before we start on the planning?  No?  Okay, le t’s get down to business.

[end of dialogue]

Our episode begins with Becky saying, “I want to thank all  of you for coming today.”  Becky is obviously talking to a group of people.  S he says, “I think we all agree that we need to organize a protest,” something t hat you do to show other people you think a situation is wrong or unfair.  Pedro  says, “Hold on, Becky.” This expression, “hold on,” means wait a minute, or slow down, or stop for a certain amount of time.  We use it when we want someon e to stop what they are saying or to let you have a chance to say something.  It’s a n informal expression, for the most part.

“Hold on, Becky,” Pedro says, “We all want to voice our op inion that we oppose what is going on here, but I’m not sure a protest is the answer.”  Pedro says they all want to voice their opinion.  To “voice” something means to express your opinions (your ideas) by speaking, letting other people know what you think. “Voice” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Pedro says they want to voice their opinion that they “opp ose,” or are against, what is going on here, but he’s not sure a protest is the answer, meaning is the right thing to do for this situation.  Becky says, “With al l due respect, Pedro.” That expression, “with all due respect,” means I don’t want to offend you – I don’t want to make you angry, but I have to disagree with you.   Becky says, “With all due respect, Pedro, I think a rally is the best way to do  that” – the best way to show people we oppose this situation.  A “rally” is a la rge meeting with many people in a public place, usually so they can show their su pport or opposition to something or someone.  For example, a politician may visit  a city and have a rally, where thousands of people come, and applaud, an d listen to the politician speak.

Pedro says, “That may be (meaning you might be correct th at a rally is the best way to do this), but I think we need to consider a few things first.  Taking to the streets means coordinating a lot of people,” Pedro says.  The expression “to take to the streets” means to do something in public, usuall y to express an opinion, to do something so that everyone else can see it, usually a ral ly or a protest or sometimes a “march,” which is when people walk down the s treet carrying signs to protest something.

 Pedro says the action of taking it to the streets means “coo rdinating,” or organizing, a lot of people.  “That means getting the m to show up, to march, and to hold up signs.”  To “show up,” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to attend an event, to come to a place where you are expected to be.   So if you are supposed to meet your friend at the movies and you never go, we  would say you didn’t show up.  You may not have your friend much longer, eith er!  Pedro says that you need to get people to show up, to march (to walk wi th these signs in the street), and to hold up signs.  To “hold up” a sign mea ns to use your arms to put a sign, usually a large piece of paper that has a message on it about what you are protesting about.  Often these signs will have a pie ce of wood (a wooden stick) that we use to hold the sign up so that you can ge t it higher into the air. Pedro says, “I’m not sure we have enough time to pull it  all off.”  To “pull (something) off” means to be able to do something tha t is very difficult, to successfully complete something that is difficult.

Becky says to Pedro, “Don’t get me wrong.”  This is a phrase used to show that you don’t want what you are about to say (what you are g oing to tell someone) to be misinterpreted or misunderstood.  Usually this means you ’re going to say something that the other person will disagree with.  I t’s similar to the expression Becky used earlier: “with all due respect.”  Becky says, “Don’t  get me wrong.  I’m not in favor of doing anything half-assed.”  To be “in favor of” something means to be in support of something, wanting something to ha ppen.  The expression “half-assed” is a very informal expression, something that  is a little bit vulgar. The word “ass” refers to what you sit on in your chair, b ut it’s not a nice word – not a word you would want your children to use.  The e xpression “half-assed” means not done very well, mediocre, only done partially.  Someone who doesn’t do everything they’re supposed to do, we might describe th at as “half-assed.” But again, it’s a little bit vulgar, not something you  would want to say to your boss – if you wanted to keep your job!

Becky says, “If we decide to protest, we want to do it righ t (we want to do it correctly) so that we get a lot of media coverage.”  “Me dia” refers to newspapers, television stations, radio stations, magazines, Internet we bsites; all of these are part of the media.  “Coverage” is when they print or a ir or publish something related to your story.  So, press coverage or media coverag e is when the media publish a story about your event.

Becky said, “I’m confident that we have enough people and  time to get it all done” – to get everything accomplished.  Pedro says, “Okay, b ut another thing we should be ready for is a counter protest.”  A “counte r protest” is when one

 group is protesting for something, and then there’s ano ther group in the same place that is protesting against something, that same thi ng.  So the two protest groups are facing each other.  Sometimes this is a probl em, especially if they start fighting – physically fighting.  Pedro says, “The o ther side (the people who disagree with them) isn’t going to take things lying do wn.”  To “take (something) lying down” means to accept something bad that happens w ithout fighting it, without disagreeing with it; to be “passive,” we might  say.

Becky says, “You’re right, and we’ll take that into consider ation (we’ll think about that).  Is there any more discussion before we start on t he planning?” she says to the group.  “Okay, then let’s get down to business.”  The  phrase “let’s get down to business” is used to show that you are ready to start wor king on something important, that you don’t want to wait any longer; you  want to get started on what you are working on: “let’s get down to business.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Becky:  I want to thank all of you for coming today.  I th ink we all agree that we need to organize a protest…

Pedro:  Hold on, Becky.  We all want to voice our opinio n that we oppose what is going on here, but I’m not sure a protest is the answer .

Becky:  With all due respect, Pedro, I think a rally is the  best way to do that.

Pedro:  That may be, but I think we need to consider a  few things first.  Taking to the streets means coordinating a lot of people.  That m eans getting them to show up, to march, and to hold up signs.  I’m not sure we ha ve enough time to pull it all off.

Becky:  Don’t get me wrong.  I’m not in favor of doing anything half-assed.  If we decide to protest, we want to do it right so that we g et a lot of media coverage. I’m confident that we have enough people and time to get it all done.

Pedro:  Okay, but another thing we should be ready for is a counter protest.  The other side isn’t going to take things lying down.

 Becky:  You’re right, and we’ll take that into considerat ion.  Is there any more discussion before we start on the planning?  No?  Okay, le t’s get down to business.

# Getting a Dream Job

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 28: Getting a Dream Job.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 428.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension che cks, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Getting a Dream Job” – getting a  great job.  It’s a dialogue between Tandia and Hank who are looking for a good jo b, and while talking about it use a lot of vocabulary we would use to describe  someone’s job.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tandia:  Do you want these want ads after I’m finished  with them?

Hank:  No, I’m not going to find my dream job in the classifieds.  I’m going to have to get more creative with my job search.

Tandia:  What are you looking for?

Hank:  I want a job that’s rewarding and fast-paced, an d with good growth potential, but all I see are dead-end jobs.

Tandia:  I know what you mean.  I’m looking for somethi ng that’s challenging, but also with flexible work hours.  All of my friends have gr eat jobs.  Why can’t I land one of them?

Hank:  Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, we need a better game plan.

Tandia:  What do you have in mind?

Hank:  I’m not sure, but we need to get noticed.

 Tandia:  Why don’t you take out a billboard?  That sho uld get you noticed.

Hank:  Hey, that’s really thinking out of the box.

Tandia:  I was joking!

Hank:  I’m not.  That’s an inspired idea.  Now what sh ould we put on the billboard?

Tandia:  You’re crazy!

[end of dialogue]

Tandia starts by asking Hank “Do you want these want ads af ter I’m finished with them?”  The “want ads” are advertisements, announcements by a company that is looking for a new employee.  These usually appear in t he newspapers: the want ads.  Hank says, “No, I’m not going to find my dream  job in the classifieds.” A “dream job” would be a perfect job, an ideal job, a great job.  The “classifieds” refers to a section of the newspaper where there are ver y many small advertisements, usually without any pictures or colors, usual ly at the back of the newspaper.  It’s a place where if you are going buy somet hing or sell your car, you can put a little advertisement – a little announceme nt.  This is where the want ads are found, in the classifieds, or the classified section of the newspaper.

Hank says, “I’m going to have to get more creative with my job search.”  A “job search” is the process of looking for a new job.  Going th rough and looking at want ads, applying for the job, interviewing for the j ob; all of these are part of the job search.

Tandia says, “What are you looking for?”  Hank replies, “ I want a job that’s rewarding and fast-paced.”  Something that is “reward ing” gives you a lot of pleasure, makes you feel happy or pleased.  “Fast-paced” m eans rapid, quick, very fast.  People who live in New York City have very fast- paced lives. Everyone walks quickly, moves quickly, talks quickly, eats quickly – you get the idea, very fast-paced.  Hank says he wants a job that’s rewa rding and fast- paced, and with good growth potential.  “Growth pote ntial” means opportunities to move into a better, more interesting job.  “I’m lo oking for growth potential” – I’m looking for something that I can start at one job but then get a better job, usually in the same company.  Hank says that all he sees in the wa nt ads are dead-end jobs.  “Dead-end” means without any opportunities for g rowth potential, without any opportunities to move into a more interesting, high er paying job.  If someone

 says, “I have a dead-end job,” they mean they can’t go a ny higher in the company and it’s not a very good job, usually.

Tandia says, “I know what you mean (I understand what yo u are saying).  I’m looking for something that’s challenging.”  Something is “challenging” if it is difficult but it’s interesting and enjoyable.  Tandia a lso wants a job with flexible work hours.  “Flexible” means that you can change them easi ly.  Flexible work hours would be being able to work a different schedule depending on your preferences, depending on what else you had to do that day.  The schedule, that is, can change; that would be a flexible work schedule, o r flexible work hours.

Tandia says, “All of my friends have great jobs.  Why can’t  I land one of them?” To “land” something means to get something: to get a job, to get a certain project, to make a certain deal or agreement.  If you a re a salesperson, you might say “I landed a big contract today” – this compa ny is going to buy a lot from us, I got it.  “Land” has several different meanings in English, however; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explan ations.

Hank says, “Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, we need a better game plan.” To “feel sorry for yourself” means to feel unhappy and sa d about the situation you are in; we might say “to pity yourself.”  You don’t want to feel sorry for yourself, spend all day saying “Oh, my poor life!”  Instea d, you want to get a better game plan.  A “game plan” is a strategy, a pla n for doing something.

Tandia says, “What do you have in mind?” – what is your i dea?  Hank says, “I’m not sure, but we need to get noticed.”  “To get notice d” means to get other people’s attention, to become well known to other peop le.  This actually has a couple of different meanings in English, “to get notice d,” you can, of course, find those additional explanations in the Learning Guide for this episode.

Tandia says, “Why don’t you take out a billboard?  That should get you noticed.” A “billboard” is a very large sign that you usually see on  the side of a road that has some advertising on it.  We have billboards here in L os Angeles on almost every street – advertisements, big signs.  Sunset Boulevard, which is a famous street here in Los Angeles, is known for its big billboa rds advertising movies and musicians and so forth.

Tandia is joking; she doesn’t really think they should buy, or take out, a billboard and put an advertisement on it.  Hank says, however, “Hey,  that’s really thinking out of the box.”  Hank thinks that Tandia is being seriou s.  “To think out of the box” or “to think outside of the box” means to think crea tively, to think of new,

 interesting, perhaps unusual ideas.  Tandia says, “I was j oking!” – I wasn’t serious.  Hank says, “I’m not (I’m not joking).  That’s an  inspired idea.”  An “inspired idea” is one that is exciting and interesting, one that has very good qualities.  Finally, Hank says, “Now what should we put o n the billboard?”  And Tandia says, “You’re crazy!”  She doesn’t think this is a ser ious idea at all.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tandia:  Do you want these want ads after I’m finished  with them?

Hank:  No, I’m not going to find my dream job in the classifieds.  I’m going to have to get more creative with my job search.

Tandia:  What are you looking for?

Hank:  I want a job that’s rewarding and fast-paced, an d with good growth potential, but all I see are dead-end jobs.

Tandia:  I know what you mean.  I’m looking for somethi ng that’s challenging, but also with flexible work hours.  All of my friends have gr eat jobs.  Why can’t I land one of them?

# Giving Awards and Congratulations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 29: Giving Awards and Congratulations.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 429.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com, where you can download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faster

This episode is called “Giving Awards and Congratulations. ”  It will use several vocabulary words that we associate with “congratulating,” telling someone they did a good job, as well as giving out awards to people.   Let’s get started. > Part of my job as school principal is to hand out awards a nd scholarships to students.  We recently had a ceremony to do just that. .....
> Principal:  Miguel, I want to commend you for your work this year and congratulate you for winning the science award.  It is we ll deserved.
> The recipient of this year’s community service award is Moni que for her outstanding achievements.  My heartiest congratulations to you, Monique.
> I am also very proud of another one of our students, Yug o, who has been awarded the ESL Podcast award.  This prestigious award h onors the achievements of outstanding students.  Yugo, a job well d one.
> Finally, we are also honoring one of our teachers today.   For her dedication to her students and to the school, we are recognizing the ach ievements of Ms. Niehbur.  I cannot imagine a more deserving teacher.  Please accept my sincere congratulations.

Our story begins with the “principal” of a school, the l eader or head of a school, talking about how one of his “duties,” one of his respon sibilities, is to “hand out,”

 or to give out, awards and scholarships to students.  An “a ward” is something you give a person because they have done something very well.   A “scholarship” is money you give to a person so that he or she can pay for  an education, to go to a school.

“We recently had a ceremony to do just that,” says the man in the story, the principal.  A “ceremony” is a special event that honors a p erson or a group of people.  Usually it’s a somewhat formal event.  “Ceremo ny” has a couple of different meanings in English, however, so take a look at the Learning Guide for this episode for some additional explanations.

The principal says, “We recently had a ceremony to do just that.”  The expression “to do just that” means to do exactly what we were just talking about.  We were talking about handing out awards and scholarships; we had  a ceremony to do just that, to hand out awards and scholarships.

The principal begins first by giving an award to Miguel .  He says, “Miguel, I want to commend (commend) you for your work this year.”  To “co mmend” someone means to praise them, to say publicly that they have done so mething very well. So, he’s commending Miguel for his work, and he congratu lates him for winning the science award.  To “congratulate” means to say you are happy because something good has happened to another person.  If some one gets a new job, you may congratulate them.  If your girlfriend leaves you,  her friends might congratulate her – because they didn’t like you to begin with!

Well, back to the principal.  The principal says the science  award was well deserved.  When we say something is “well deserved,” we me an that something should have happened because this person worked hard for it or did all the things that were necessary.  Something that is well deser ved is something that you have earned.  You have worked for it and now you ge t this reward, and that is only right; that is the correct thing.

The principal then says that the recipient of this year’s co mmunity service award is Monique.  A “recipient” is someone who receives somethi ng, someone to whom something is given.  To be the recipient of an awa rd means that the award was given to you.  This award is for “community service,” for  students who help out in their local community.  The winner is Monique, a nd she won for her outstanding achievements.  Something that is “outstanding ” is something that is very good, something that is very impressive.  An “achievement ” is something that you have done, usually something that’s difficult or  something that is in a specific field.  You may have achievements at work.  You sold  more than anyone

 else, or you did a better project then anyone else; you achieved your goals, you achieved what you wanted to.

So, Monique has had outstanding achievements, she has do ne some very good things.  The principal says, “My heartiest congratulations to you, Monique.” Something that is “hearty” means friendly, happy, someth ing that is sincere, something that you really mean.  So, “heartiest congrat ulations” are my most sincere, my friendliest, my happiest congratulations.

The principal says that he is also proud of one of his oth er students, Yugo, who has been awarded the ESL Podcast award.  To be “awarde d” something means to receive an award, to receive an honor, to receive recog nition.  The Nobel Prizes are among the most important awards in literatu re, science, and so forth. Yugo won the ESL Podcast award, probably for the smart est student since only the smartest people listen to ESL Podcast!

“This prestigious award,” he says, “honors the achievements of outstanding students.”  Something that is “prestigious” is something that is well respected, very important, one of the best.  The Nobel Prizes are p restigious.  If you win one you are considered a very important person.  Now, if you’ re a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and you receive a Nob el Prize, you get your own parking space!  You see, there are very few parking sp aces – good parking spaces – at that university, so if you win a Nobel Prize, we ll, you get a parking space.  In some places, a parking space is as important as winning a prize!

Yugo has won a prestigious award that honors the achievem ents of outstanding students.  The verb “to honor” means to show publicly tha t you have done something very well.  This is something that is usually do ne to someone who is important or someone who has done something that you want other people to know about.  Yugo is told by the principal “a job well done.”  The expression “a job well done” is a phrase used to show that someone has done something very well.  It’s a way of congratulating someone on doing a good job: “a job well done.”

Finally, there is an award given to one of the teachers.   The award is for her dedication to her students and to the school.  “Dedica tion,” here, means commitment, working hard on something.  This teacher ha s worked hard, and so they are recognizing her achievements.  This is Ms. Niehbur winning this award. “I can’t imagine a more deserving teacher,” the princip al says.  Someone who is “deserving” is someone who has earned something for what they have done, someone who should get this award because of all they hav e done.  The

 principal says to Ms. Niehbur, “Please accept my sincere congr atulations.”  This is a somewhat formal expression to congratulate someone: “please accept my sincere congratulations.”  You are telling someone you are very happy or proud of what he or she has done.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. > Part of my job as school principal is to hand out awards a nd scholarships to students.  We recently had a ceremony to do just that. .....
> Principal:  Miguel, I want to commend you for your work this year and congratulate you for winning the science award.  It is we ll deserved.
> The recipient of this year’s community service award is Moni que for her outstanding achievements.  My heartiest congratulations to you, Monique.
> I am also very proud of another one of our students, Yug o, who has been awarded the ESL Podcast award.  This prestigious award h onors the achievements of outstanding students.  Yugo, a job well d one.
> Finally, we are also honoring one of our teachers today.   For her dedication to her students and to the school, we are recognizing the ach ievements of Ms. Niehbur.  I cannot imagine a more deserving teacher.  Please accept my sincere congratulations.

# Talking About Books

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 30: Talking About Books.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 430.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download the Le arning Guide for this episode, which will help you improve your English even fa ster.

This episode is called “Talking About Books.”  It’s a dialo gue between Maggie and Kurt using some common vocabulary we might use in talki ng about and recommending books.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Maggie:  What did you think of the book you started last  week?

Kurt:  Oh, I liked it well enough.

Maggie:  Wow, that’s a glowing recommendation.

Kurt:  Well, it started off with a bang and the suspe nse in the first half was great. I couldn’t put it down.  Then, the pace changed in the  second half and it was an effort to finish it.

Maggie:  Really?  I read it a few months ago and I lo ved it.  I thought the characterization was really good.  I could really relate to the two main characters.

Kurt:  Yeah, that’s true enough, but the plot dragge d, don’t you think?  The author just couldn’t pull it off and the ending was laughabl e.

Maggie:  I really liked the ending!  I can’t wait for the sequel.

Kurt:  Well, that makes one  of us.

[end of dialogue]

 Our dialogue begins with Maggie asking Kurt, “What did  you think of the book you started last week?” meaning the book you started to r ead last week.  Kurt said, “Oh, I liked it well enough.”  When someone says t hey like something “well enough,” it means they didn’t think it was great; it w as okay; it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t great either.  Maggie said, somewhat sarcasticall y, trying to be funny, “Wow, that’s a glowing recommendation.”  A “glowing r ecommendation” is an enthusiastic statement that you should definitely do somet hing or see something or hear something.  A “recommendation” is a suggestion t o someone else; a “glowing recommendation” is a very positive, very enthusiast ic recommendation. Of course, Kurt is not giving a glowing recommendation;  Maggie’s just being funny.

Kurt says, “Well, (the book) started off with a bang.”  To “start off with a bang” (bang) means to begin in an exciting way, to begin well : “The meeting started off with a bang when the president said everyone would be g etting two weeks extra vacation this year.”  Kurt says the book “started off with a  bang (it was exciting at the beginning) and the suspense in the first half was g reat.”  The “suspense” is the feeling of being excited and wanting to know what is going to happen next, when you’re looking forward to something that will hap pen next.  There are lots of movies that that are suspenseful.  The movies of Alfred H itchcock, the great British director in the 1950s and 60s, those are suspense movies; you are waiting for something to happen.

Kurt says about the book, “I couldn’t put it down.”  To not be able to put a book (or something) down means you can’t stop reading it be cause it’s so exciting. When you’re reading a really good book, you really want  to continue reading it; you can’t put it down.  To “put (something) down” mean s literally to take it and put it on the table, or stop reading it in this case.  Kurt says, “Then, the pace changed in the second half (of the book) and it was an effort to finish it.”  The “pace,” here, just means the speed or rate of something.   This is a word we use about, for example, runners in a race: they are going a t a fast pace or a slow pace.  We can also use it to describe a book that you are reading.  “It’s going at a very fast pace” means it’s going very quickly, the story is changi ng and moving forward very quickly.  The word “pace” has a couple of di fferent meanings in English; look at the Learning Guide today for some addi tional explanations.

Kurt says that it was an effort to finish the book.  An “ effort,” here, means something that is difficult, something that requires ext ra work, extra concentration.  Maggie says, “Really?  I read it a few m onths ago and I loved it.” So, Maggie read the same book and she loved it.  “I tho ught the characterization was really good,” she says.  In a story – in a fictional or imaginary story,

 “characterization” is the way that people are made to se em real, usually in a book, story, or movie.  So someone may say, “Boy, this book has good characterization.”  That means that the people in the b ooks seemed real; they seemed interesting, perhaps, or complex.  Maggie says, “I co uld really relate to the two main characters.”  To “relate to someone,” or t o “relate to something,” means to understand someone, to be able to find someth ing similar in your own experiences.  Sometimes we simply say, “I can relate.”  F or example, you are in an airport and the person next to you is worried because  they are going to miss their flight (they will not leave at the correct time),  and you may say, “I can relate to that.  I missed my flight yesterday.”  Or, we may just  say informally, “I can relate,” meaning I understand.  So, Maggie can relat e to the characters (the people in the story), that means she can understand them ; she has some sort of common experience that they share.

Kurt says, “Yeah, that’s true enough (meaning that’s tru e), but the plot dragged, don’t you think?”  The “plot” is sometimes called the stor yline.  It’s the things that happen in a movie or a book or a story.  It’s the events t hat happen: the person goes to the party, he talks to a pretty girl, the girl i s not interested, so he talks to another pretty girl, and so on.  That would be a “plo t.”  That would also be the story of my life!  Now, when the “plot drags,” we mean it moves very slowly; it moves at a slow and boring pace; it doesn’t seem to move forward very quickly. “Drag” actually has a couple of meanings in English in a ddition to this one, so you know what to do: take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Kurt says, “The author just couldn’t pull it off.”  The “author” is the man or woman who writes the book or story; we may also call them the “w riter,” especially if we are talking about a movie.  The technical term for someo ne who writes a movie would be a “scriptwriter.”  Here on ESL Podcast our scrip twriter, the person who writes these stories that we talk about – these wonderfu l stories, is Dr. Lucy Tse. She’s the author of these dialogues.  “The author just couldn’t pull it off.”  This is an expression, a phrasal verb, “to pull (something) off”  or “to pull off (something)” means to be able to do something successfully; to be able to complete something that is difficult, especially when other peopl e don’t think you will be able to do it.  Kurt says the author could not pull it  off, “and the ending was laughable.”  The “ending” is, you may guess, the final p art of the story, the conclusion.  If you say something is “laughable, you mean it is so bad that it is funny because you can’t do anything other than laugh abo ut it.  You, in some ways, can’t believe how bad it is.  So, “laughable” mean s funny, but it means funny because it’s so bad.

 Maggie says, “I really liked the ending!  I can’t wait for the sequel.”  A “sequel” (sequel) is the second part or continuation of a book o r a movie.  So, it’s the second book.  I read a book a long time ago, a suspense s py book called Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy  by the British author John le Carré.  After he wrote that book it was very successful, so then he wrote another book – a sequ el.  There are a series of popular movies based on a book; the first one wa s called The Bourne Identity .  And then, that was successful so the author wrote anot her book, and they also made movies about these three books.  So, each on e is a sequel; the second and third books are sequels to the first.

Kurt doesn’t agree with Maggie, so he says, “Well, that makes one  of us.” Actually, Kurt is making a joke here: the normal expression  is “that makes two of us” when, for example, someone says something and you are  in the same situation.  Somebody says, “Oh, I missed my airplane (I misse d my flight at the airport),” you may say, “Well, that makes two of us.  I missed my flight, too.” Here, Kurt is making a joke, he says “that makes one  of us,” which is just a funny way to say you are the only person that thinks that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l pace.

[start of dialogue]

Maggie:  What did you think of the book you started last  week?

Kurt:  Oh, I liked it well enough.

Maggie:  Wow, that’s a glowing recommendation.

Kurt:  Well, it started off with a bang and the suspe nse in the first half was great. I couldn’t put it down.  Then, the pace changed in the  second half and it was an effort to finish.

Maggie:  Really?  I read it a few months ago and I lo ved it.  I thought the characterization was really good.  I could really relate to the two main characters.

Kurt:  Yeah, that’s true enough, but the plot dragge d, don’t you think?  The author just couldn’t pull it off and the ending was laughabl e.

Maggie:  I really liked the ending!  I can’t wait for the sequel.

Kurt:  Well, that makes one  of us.

 [end of dialogue]

The author of this fast-paced script today was Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Health in Developing Countries

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 31: Health in Developing Countries.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 431.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can download a L earning Guide for this episode that gives you additional vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a complete tr anscript of everything we say on the audio podcast.

This episode is called “Health in Developing Countries,”  countries that are still growing.  It’s a dialogue between Silvia and Hermann about common problems in these countries.  Let’s listen:

[start of dialogue]

Silvia:  What are you watching?

Hermann:  I’m watching a show about the health probl ems in developing countries.

Silvia:  Don’t we have enough healthcare problems here,  in this country?

Hermann:  We do, but there are countries that have a l ot more acute problems than we do.

Silvia:  Oh, those kids are so cute.

Hermann:  Yeah, but a lot of them are going to die of malnutrition and infectious diseases, things that are preventable.

Silvia:  I thought the biggest problem was the spread of AIDS and HIV.

Hermann:  Those are huge problems, no question about it, but a lot of people die of other preventable diseases, too, such as malaria, tube rculosis, and measles. Believe it or not, we’ve had immunizations for measles for over 40 years!

 Silvia:  That’s terrible.  I can see why you’re studying me dicine.  I wish I could be a doctor.

Hermann:  You could, but first, you’ll need to get over  your fear of blood.

[end of dialogue]

Silvia begins by asking Hermann, “What are you watching?” – what are you watching on TV?  Hermann says, “I’m watching a show abou t the health problems in developing countries.”  Again, a “developing  country” is a country usually that has lower income and often many health pr oblems.  To “develop” means to grow, to become larger; that’s another possible  meaning.  Usually, a developing country is a country that still has some serious e conomic problems.

Silvia says, “Don’t we have enough healthcare problems he re, in this country?” “Healthcare” (one word) is the system and practice for taki ng care of people who are sick, trying to make them healthier.  Hermann says, “We  do (we do have many problems here in our country), but there are coun tries that have a lot more acute problems than we do.”  “Acute,” here, means very se rious, severe, strong. “Acute” has a couple of different meanings in English; t ake a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Hermann points out that a lot of the children are going to die of malnutrition and infectious diseases, things that are preventable.  “Maln utrition” means poor nutrition.  “Nutrition” is a word that describes, in t his case, food (what people eat). So, “malnutrition” is not having enough good food, he althy food.  Sometimes this causes more health problems when someone doesn’t have enou gh to eat. “Infectious diseases” are diseases that can be passed from on e person to the next.  They are diseases, we say, that you can “catch” from so meone else, meaning you can get them; they can be transmitted from  one person to another. These sorts of problems, Hermann says, “are preventable.”  Something that is “preventable” can be avoided, it’s not certain it can hap pened.  You can prevent it, you can prevent it from happening; you can stop it f rom happening.

Silvia says, “I thought the biggest problem was the spread  of AIDS and HIV.” “AIDS” stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  It ’s a disease that usually causes death because your body cannot fight against ot her diseases and infections.  “HIV” stands for human immunodeficiency virus; it’s the virus that can cause AIDS.  Hermann says, “Those are huge problems, no question about it,” meaning absolutely, there’s no doubt that these are ser ious problems (AIDS and HIV), “but a lot of people die of other preventable diseases, too, such as malaria,

 tuberculosis, and measles.”  “Malaria” is an illness that yo u find in many hot, warm, what we would call “tropical” countries.  It is cau sed by a type of mosquito that spreads the disease.  The “mosquito” is a small flyin g insect; it bites a person.  “Tuberculosis,” which we often in English just cal l “TB” – TB or tuberculosis is a serious disease that affects your lungs, your  ability to breathe; it makes people cough.  Tuberculosis was quite common in the United States and in other countries in the 19th century, especially in large cities.  Tuberculosis is a “communicable” disease, meaning that it’s infectious – you can get it from other people.  Many of my relatives who came to the United Sta tes the 19th century died of tuberculosis, living in large, crowded cities.  “M easles” is a disease that causes, usually, a high “fever,” where the body temperatur e goes up.  You often see small, red spots on a person’s skin when they have measle s.

Hermann says, “Believe it or not, we’ve had immunization s for measles for over 40 years!”  “Immunization” is protection against gettin g a disease.  Usually it’s an “injection,” what we often call simply a “shot,” where the doctor or nurse takes a long, sharp piece of metal, a “needle,” and puts it in  your arm and “injects,” or puts, medicine into your bloodstream.  I went to the do ctor the other day, recently, and I got a flu shot.  This is a type of immun ization.  Young babies and children often receive several shots to “immunize” (the verb ) them against common diseases like measles.  Sometimes we describe these shot s as “vaccinations.”

Silvia says, “That’s terrible.  I can see why you’re studying medicine.  I wish I could be a doctor,” Silvia says.  Hermann says, “You could ( you could be a doctor), but first, you’ll need to get over your fear of  blood.”  “Blood,” of course, is the red liquid that flows through your body.  I’m like  Silvia; I could never be a real doctor – a medical doctor.  I don’t like the sight of bl ood either!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Silvia:  What are you watching?

Hermann:  I’m watching a show about the health probl ems in developing countries.

Silvia:  Don’t we have enough healthcare problems here,  in this country?

 Hermann:  We do, but there are countries that have a l ot more acute problems than we do.

Silvia:  Oh, those kids are so cute.

Hermann:  Yeah, but a lot of them are going to die of malnutrition and infectious diseases, things that are preventable.

Silvia:  I thought the biggest problem was the spread of AIDS and HIV.

Hermann:  Those are huge problems, no question about it, but a lot of people die of other preventable diseases, too, such as malaria, tube rculosis, and measles. Believe it or not, we’ve had immunizations for measles for over 40 years!

Silvia:  That’s terrible.  I can see why you’re studying me dicine.  I wish I could be a doctor.

Hermann:  You could, but first, you’ll need to get over  your fear of blood.

# Using the Copier

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 32: Using the Copier.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 432.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there and download a Lea rning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even fast er.

This episode is called “Using the Copier.”  The “copier,”  or the “photocopier,” is a machine that we use to make copies of pieces of paper – t he things that are on the paper.  We have a dialogue between Tim and Pam a bout some common problems – some common vocabulary you may encounter (you may h ear) when talking about the copy machine.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tim:  Damn it!

Pam:  What’s the matter?

Tim:  It’s this copier.  My original didn’t come out of the feeder and there’s a paper jam.

Pam:  Let me see if I can clear it.  This machine is rea lly temperamental.

Tim:  Tell me about it.

Pam:  Okay, I found your original, but it’s stuck.  I’m a fraid if I pull too hard, it’ll tear.

Tim:  Let me try.  I got it!  Okay, I need to shrink the first page and adjust the contrast so that it’s more readable.  Then I need to en large the second page. After that, I need to make 20 collated copies.

Pam:  Oh, oh, don’t look now, but the toner light is on.  You’ll need to put in a new cartridge.

 Tim:  Is there anything else that can go wrong with thi s stupid copier?!

Pam:  Don’t tempt fate.  It could be worse.  The whol e thing could break down!

[end of dialogue]

Tim begins our dialogue by “swearing,” by saying a not very nice word.  He says, “Damn it!”  “Damn it” is an expression that you use when you’re angry at something or someone.  It’s not something you would want  to say in front of children or your boss, for example.  Sometimes people simp ly say “damn.”  If they want to say something that is not a swear word (not a bad word), they may say something like “darn it” or “darn,” although that ca n seem a little old- fashioned to some people nowadays.

Tim says, “Damn it!” and Pam asks, “What’s the matter?” me aning what’s the problem.  Tim says, “It’s this copier.”  The “copier” is t he photocopy machine, what in many offices people call the “copy machine.”  Tim  says, “My original didn’t come out of the feeder and there’s a paper jam .”  The “original” would be the document or other piece of paper that you are tryin g to make a copy of.  The “feeder” (feeder) is the part of the copy machine where  you put your paper into, the paper that you want to copy.  For example, if you ha ve 10 pages, you would put those 10 pages, all at once, into a feeder and the  copy machine will take one page at a time and copy it.  At least, most copy machines h ave feeders; not all of them do.  A “jam” (jam) in this dialogue means a situ ation where a machine stops working because something inside of it is in the wrong po sition or the wrong place.  We especially use this expression when we are talking  about something that you put into a machine, for example, you’re puttin g paper into the copy machine and if the paper doesn’t go through correctly – if it gets “stuck,” we could say – if it stops moving inside the machine when it should continue to move, we will say that there is a jam – a paper jam.  If you wo rk with copy machines, you know this is a common problem, especially when they get very  warm.

Pam says, “Let me see if I can clear it.”  To “clear” some thing means, in this case, to fix the jam, to take out the thing that has cause d the problem.  Pam says, “This machine is really temperamental.”  The word “t emperamental” means something that only works some of the time, something th at is difficult to operate correctly.  It can also be used to describe someone who i s perhaps a little unstable, someone who changes their mood very quickly.  We might describe that person as being temperamental.

 Tim says, “Tell me about it.”  After Pam says machine is r eally temperamental, Tim uses an expression that shows that he agrees with Pam.  It’s often something that you will say, this expression “tell me about  it,” when it’s a negative thing and that you already know about it and you have a  lot of, perhaps, experience with it.

Pam says, “Okay, I found your original, but it’s stuck.”  We  mentioned earlier that a paper jam is when paper gets stuck.  “Stuck” means unab le to move, something that is trapped in one place or position.  So metimes we use this expression when we’re trying to figure out a complicated  problem.  For example, a student is doing a math problem, let’s say an algebra  problem, and he starts to solve the problem but after a few minutes he doesn’t kno w what to do.  He might say, “I’m stuck” – I can’t move forward, I don’t know the a nswer.  Here, the term refers to the paper that can’t move because it’s inside  the machine.  Pam says, “I’m afraid if I pull too hard, (the original – the  paper) will tear (tear).”  “Tear” means to be ripped into two or more pieces.  This is a ve rb we use, for example, when you have a piece of paper and you do this [sound of paper being torn].  If you rip or tear the paper, the paper will now be in two different pieces.  The word “tear,” like the word “feeder” that we mentioned ear lier, has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Tim says, “Let me try,” meaning let me try to get the pa per out of the machine. He then says, “I got it!”  He was able to remove it.  “ Okay, I need to shrink the first page and adjust the contrast so that it is more rea dable.”  To “shrink” means to make something smaller, to reduce the size.  To “adjust  the contrast” means to change the difference between two things, usually someth ing that is white and black or light and dark.  So, if you have a piece of pa per where the writing isn’t very clear, you may increase the contrast so that the cop ier is able to copy more effectively.  So, “contrast” is a difference between two  things; when we’re talking about a copy machine, it refers to the black and the wh ite on the page.  Tim says, “Then I need to enlarge the second page.”  To “enlarg e” is the opposite of to reduce or to shrink; to “enlarge” means to make larger,  to make something bigger.  “After that,” Tim says, “I need to make 20 col lated copies.”  Something that is “collated” is something that is put into the corr ect order.  So, if you have three pages that you are copying, and you need to make 1 0 copies for a meeting you’re going to, “collated copies” would be copies wher e the pages (one, two, and three) are in the correct order.  Not 10 pages wit h page one, 10 pages with page two, 10 pages with page three; that would be un -collated.

 Tim says that he needs 20 collated copies, but Pam says, “Oh,  oh, don’t look now.”  “Oh, oh” is when something wrong happens – some thing bad happens, and you are indicating that.  The expression “don’t look now” is a phrase used to tell someone that there’s a problem that you know will  make him or her angry or upset.  Pam says, “don’t look now, but the toner light is on.”  The “toner” (toner) is the “ink,” the black stuff or the colored stuff that is use d in printers, fax machines, and copiers.  Usually you can only get so many copies from one  cartridge of toner.  A “cartridge” is the package, the small, often plastic box where the ink (the toner) is kept.  So, if your toner “runs out” (if there ’s no more), you’ll have to put in a new toner cartridge.

Tim says, “Is there anything else that can go wrong with t his stupid copier?!” Notice Tim says the “stupid copier,” we often say that ab out a thing when we are frustrated with it.  Of course, the copier isn’t stupid; it isn’t anything at all, it’s not human.  Maybe Tim’s the stupid one here!

Pam says, “Don’t tempt fate.”  The expression “to tempt f ate” means to take a risk or do something knowing that something bad may happ en.  Pam says, “It could be worse (the situation could be worse).  The whol e thing (the entire copy machine) could break down!”  To “break down” is a two-w ord phrasal verb for a machine or a car to stop working, something that stops wor king and needs to be fixed.  We use this verb in talking about a car: “My car br oke down,” meaning something bad happened, something went wrong and the car needs to be fixed.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tim:  Damn it!

Pam:  What’s the matter?

Tim:  It’s this copier.  My original didn’t come out of the feeder and there’s a paper jam.

Pam:  Let me see if I can clear it.  This machine is rea lly temperamental.

Tim:  Tell me about it.

Pam:  Okay, I found your original, but it’s stuck.  I’m a fraid if I pull too hard, it’ll tear.

 Tim:  Let me try.  I got it!  Okay, I need to shrink the first page and adjust the contrast so that it’s more readable.  Then I need to en large the second page. After that, I need to make 20 collated copies.

# Describing People¡¦s Voices

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 33: Describing People’s Voices.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 433.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can download a L earning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, culture notes, comprehension que stions, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Describing People’s Voices.”  It’s a dialogue between Adriana and Ralph talking about the qualities of peop le’s voices, common adjectives we use to describe different voices.  Let’s get st arted.

[start of dialogue]

Adriana:  Shhh, I’m trying to listen to the radio.

Ralph:  How can you listen to that radio station?  All of their deejays have such funny voices.

Adriana:  That’s precisely why I like it.  Take this guy, K evin.  He has a deep, husky voice that I find really sexy.

Ralph:  This guy?  His voice is so monotone that it lulls me to sleep every time I hear it.

Adriana:  Well, if you don’t like his voice, how about h is sidekick, Lisa May?  Her voice is music to my ears.

Ralph:  She has a nice lilt in her voice, but it’s so hig h-pitched and squeaky.  It can really be grating to listen to her for more than a  few minutes.

Adriana:  Okay, if you don’t like their voices, what kind of voices do you like?

Ralph:  I like a gravelly voice, speaking softly and saying...

 Adriana:  I’m not talking about your fantasies.  I don ’t want to know anything about those!

[end of dialogue]

Adriana begins the dialogue by saying to Ralph, “Shhh .”  The expression “shhh,” or the sound “shhh,” is what we use to get someone to be  quiet.  Technically, when you do that is called “shushing” someone.  Well, Ad riana shushes Ralph; Ralph said, “How can you listen to that radio station?   All of their deejays have such funny (or unusual) voices.”  Sometimes the word “funny ” means unusual, strange, not comic.  A “deejay” (deejay), sometimes abbre viated with the letters “D” and “J” because it actually comes from the abbreviation  for disk jockey.  A “disk jockey” or “deejay” is a person who plays music and, usua lly, is on the radio.  They play music; they talk about the songs – the pe rson that you hear on the radio, at least the music radio.

Adriana says, “That’s precisely why I like it.”  She likes the deejays because they have these interesting or unusual voices.  She says, “Take th is guy, Kevin.”  The verb here, to “take” something or someone, means to use someone as an example; it’s another way of saying for example.  You mi ght say, “I like traveling in the western part of the United States, where there  are beautiful parks.  Take California, we have some beautiful parks here in Califo rnia.”  I could also say “For example, California, we have some beautiful parks here in California.”

Well, Adriana says, “Take this guy, Kevin.  He has a deep, husky voice that I find really sexy.”  “Deep,” when we are talking about a voice, is someone who has a voice that is very low, like this: [speaking in a low tone] “Hello there baby.”  That would be a deep voice – and a voice that could get you in  a lot of trouble with your wife!  “Deep” has several different meanings in Eng lish; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  “Husky”  (husky), when we are talking about a voice, is a low sound voice – a deep voice, but it’s sort of attractive.  It’s often used to describe some men’s voices.  Interestingly enough, “husky,” when used to describe someone’s body usually means so meone who is very big, perhaps a little overweight.  But when we ta lk about a voice being husky, it’s usually a positive description.

Adriana finds the deep, husky voice of Kevin to be sexy, to be sexually exciting or attractive.  Ralph says, “This guy?”  He can’t believe what Adriana is saying. Ralph says Kevin’s “voice is so monotone that it lulls me to  sleep every time I hear it.”  The word “monotone” means always the same no te, always the same tone; perhaps even the same volume, never quiet or loud.   “Mono” means one,

 so it’s one kind of tone or one kind of note.  A monoto ne voice would be something like this: [speaking in a monotone] “I am speaki ng in a monotone voice.  Please wake up now if you have fallen asleep.”  Ki nd of like a computer voice, I guess.  When we say something “lulls” (lulls) someo ne, we mean that it makes someone feel calm, relaxed, often tired, maybe even  making someone fall asleep.

Well, Ralph thinks Kevin’s voice is monotone, and it makes him sleep.  Adriana says, “Well, if you don’t like his voice, how about his side kick, Lisa May?”  “How about” means what do you think of his sidekick.  A “sidekick”  (sidekick – one word) is someone who works with another person and help s them, but isn’t as important as the other person.  For example, in the com ics there is Batman and Robin.  Well, Batman is the most important person; Rob in is his sidekick.  On many popular radio shows, at least in the United State s, there are two people that are on the radio: the main person and then someo ne else who is the sidekick that they talk to or make jokes with.

Adriana says the voice of the Lisa May, Kevin’s sidekick on the radio, is music to her ears.  The expression “to be music to one’s ears” means that something is very pleasant to listen to, something that you enjoy listen ing to.  We hope that ESL Podcast is music to your ears!  It doesn’t mean you necessa rily are listening to music, however.  “Music to your ears” can also be used to  mean that you are giving someone good news or you are hearing good news.

Ralph responds by saying that Lisa May “has a nice lilt (li lt) in her voice.”  A “lilt” is the way that a voice goes up and down, up and down, h igher and lower.  It’s supposed to make your voice sound more pleasant.  It’s, in some ways, the opposite of monotone.  However, Ralph thinks that Lisa May’s voice is very high- pitched and squeaky.  Something that is “high-pitched” is something that has a sound at a very high note, so high that it could hurt you r ears or be unpleasant.  If I were to speak in a high-pitched voice I might sound, for example, like a woman: [speaking in a high pitch] “Hello.  How are you?”  Pre tty annoying, isn’t it?  A “squeaky” voice is a voice that sounds a little like a mouse;  it’s [squeaking sounds] “ee, ee, ee,” that would be a squeaky voice.  I d on’t have a squeaky voice, so it’s hard for me to imitate that.  Ralph says, “ It can really be grating to listen to her.”  When we say something is “grating” (gra ting) we mean it is annoying, it is unpleasant, it is irritating.

Adriana says, well, “if you don’t like their voices, what ki nd of voices do you like?” Ralph says, “I like a gravelly voice.”  “Gravelly” (gravelly) is a very low, rough, almost a deep kind of sound, but it’s something that you  could use to describe a

 woman’s voice as well.  Ralph says, “I like a gravelly voice,  speaking softly and saying...”  – well, what Ralph is referring to here is that sometimes women who are trying to be or make themselves sexually attractive may speak in this lower voice.  At least, some men find that voice attractive – fin d it “sexy.”

Adriana says, “I’m not talking about your fantasies.”  You r “fantasy” is something that you imagine might happen, something you would li ke to happen.  But, of course, Adriana isn’t interested in Ralph’s fantasies abou t women, she says, “I don’t want to know anything about those!”  And neithe r do we!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Adriana:  Shhh, I’m trying to listen to the radio.

Ralph:  How can you listen to that radio station?  All of their deejays have such funny voices.

Adriana:  That’s precisely why I like it.  Take this guy, K evin.  He has a deep, husky voice that I find really sexy.

Ralph:  This guy?  His voice is so monotone that it lulls me to sleep every time I hear it.

# Using Coupons and Rebates

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 34: Using Coupons and Rebates.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 434.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode and to take a look at our ESL Podcast Store an d ESL Podcast Blog.

This episode is called “Using Coupons and Rebates.”  Many p eople use coupons and rebates to save money.  We’ll talk about what those are by listening to a dialogue between Torsten and Cindy.  Let’s go!

[start of dialogue]

Torsten:  What are you doing, clipping coupons?  That’s a  waste of time.

Cindy:  You can think what you like, but these days, we have  to cut corners wherever we can.

Torsten:  No one actually saves much money using coupons.

Cindy:  That’s what you think.  The last time I went to the grocery store, I saved over $20 just by using coupons.

Torsten:  How can you keep track of all of the expiration  dates and the terms and conditions?  It’s not worth the trouble.

Cindy:  Do you feel that way about rebate offers, too?  A month ago, I bought our new TV and saved 20 percent.  And yesterday, I bought a  pack of DVDs for just $2.

Torsten:  Are you putting me on?  A pack of DVDs for $2?

Cindy:  Yeah, it was a great offer, but it was only for  one day.  I had to cut out the UPC code, fill out a form, and mail it in with the r eceipt to the manufacturer.

 Then, I sent a copy of the receipt to the retailer a nd got another discount.  That’s how I got the DVDs for next to nothing.

Torsten:  You might save money with rebates, but you have to sit around forever waiting for the rebate check.

Cindy:  It’s true that the turnaround is often 8-10 we eks, but some of the offers are worth the wait.

Torsten:  Do what you like, but I’m too busy to mess aroun d with coupons and rebates.

Cindy:  That’s why you married a penny-pincher.  If I le ft it up to you, we’d be in the poorhouse by now!

[end of dialogue]

Torsten begins by asking Cindy, “What are you doing, clipp ing coupons?”  To “clip” (clip) something means to cut something, sometimes  to make it shorter or smaller.  Here, it means to cut something to separate it from what is around it.  A “coupon” is a small piece of paper, usually, that a shoppe r (someone in a store) will show in order to get a discount.  In the newspaper s and magazines you’ll often see coupons, and you cut the coupon out (we woul d say you “clip” the coupon) and take it to usually a grocery store, but it co uld be another kind of store, and you get a “discount,” you get to pay less money for that thing.

Torsten thinks clipping coupons is a waste of time.  Cindy sa ys, “You can think what you like (meaning I don’t care what you think), but  these days (nowadays), we have to cut corners wherever we can.”  To “cut corners”  means to save money or to save time by doing something differently, som ething that is not the normal or usual way.  Usually cutting corners refers to savin g money, but it could be saving time.  You don’t want the airline pilot, for example, to cut corners when it comes to your safety; you want him to take as much time as possible – or her.

Cindy says that they have to cut corners wherever they can.  Torsten says, “No one actually saves much money using coupons.”  Cindy says, “Tha t’s what you think.”  The expression “that’s what you think” means you di sagree with what the other person has said.  Usually, this is followed by your re asons why you think that person is wrong.  Notice that there’s an emphasis o n the word “you”: “Well,

 that’s what you think, but...” and then you give your rea sons why this person is wrong.

Cindy says the last time she went to the grocery store to bu y food; she saved over $20 just by using coupons.  Torsten says, “How can you kee p track of all of the expiration dates and terms and conditions?”  An “e xpiration date” is the date after which something cannot be used or something will no longer be valid.  So, if the coupon has an expiration date of November 1st that means that you can’t use it after November 1st.  “Terms and conditions,” what some people in the busin ess world call “Ts and Cs” – “terms and conditions” are pa rts of a legal agreement that give specific details about how something will work o r how something will function.  So, it’s the legal information about what you are selling or what service you are providing.

Torsten says that coupons are “not worth the trouble,” me aning they are not beneficial; they don’t really help very much, especially be cause you have to spend time clipping them and so forth.  Cindy says, “Do you  feel that way about rebate offers, too?”  A “rebate” is money that you get  back from the company that makes or sells a product (something that you buy).  After yo u buy it you can get, from some companies on some products, a rebate – money back.   Now, often you have to do something to get that money back.  A “reba te offer” is when the company says that they will give you some of your money back, or perhaps even all of the money back, if you buy this thing at a certain time or on a certain day, and usually you have to prove that you bought it.  So you  have to send a form – send a piece of paper to the company with a copy of you r receipt or some other what we would call “proof of purchase,” meaning eviden ce that you bought something.

Cindy says a month ago she bought a pack (or a set) of DVDs for just two dollars.  Torsten says, “Are you putting me on?”  To “put  someone on” is a phrasal verb meaning to trick someone, to deceive someone, to get someone to believe something that isn’t true.  Sometimes people do  this just to be funny. When I say, for example, that you can find tickets to Haw aii in our Learning Guide for this episode, I’m putting you on; I’m not r eally serious.  Really, I’m not; we don’t have tickets in our Learning Guide for this epi sode, I’m sorry!

Cindy says, “it was a great offer, but it was only for one  day.”  So, of course, she’s not putting Torsten on, she’s telling the truth.  She then explains how she got the rebate.  She said she had to cut out the UPC code.  The “UPC code” stands for Universal Product Code; sometimes we call it simp ly the “bar code.”

 It’s a small rectangle that you will find on most packages – most things that are sold in the United States in a store – that has many vert ical black lines and numbers that a machine can read.  That is, the machine can detect what the price is and what the thing is.  Most stores have a special machine call a “scanner” that you use with these UPC, or bar codes.

However, Cindy is cutting out the UPC code as a proof of purchase, evidence that she bought this thing.  In order to get the reba te, Cindy has to fill out a “form,” a piece of paper with her name and address on it, and mail that form in with the receipt to the manufacturer.  The “receipt”  is the piece of paper the store gives you to show that you bought something; it has the p rice of what you bought.  The “manufacturer” is the company that makes a p roduct – a physical product.  Computers are manufactured by companies such as A pple and other computer companies, for example.

Cindy says, “Then, I sent a copy of the receipt to the ret ailer and got another discount.”  The “retailer” is the store that sold the pr oduct.  So we have the manufacturer that made the product, and then you have t he store that sold it. Cindy is actually getting two rebates here, one from the manufacturer and one from the store – the retailer.  She got another “disco unt,” which is a reduction in the price of something.  “Discount” has a couple of diffe rent meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Torsten says, “You might save money with rebates, but you h ave to sit around (you have to wait) forever for the rebate check.”  The “rebate check” is the money that the company is sending you back.  Sometimes it will  be $5, $10; it could be $500, depending on how big the rebate is, and, of cou rse, depending on what you buy.  Now, not every company offers rebates on their pr oducts.  It’s something that only some companies do sometimes to get pe ople to buy their product.

Cindy says, “It’s true that the turnaround is often 8-10 weeks.”  The “turnaround” is the amount of time needed to send something, have t he company look at it, take care of it, and then send, in this case, the rebate check back.  So it’s the time that you send something in and then you get it ba ck.  We can use this word in talking about anything that you, for example, submit an application for and then have to wait before you get back whatever you are waiting  for.  If you are going to get a driver’s license in the United States, there ma y be a certain turnaround time.  That is, it may take a few days or even a few we eks for the state government to send you your physical license.  Cindy says that the offers (the

 rebate offers) are “worth the wait,” meaning they are good enough that one is willing to wait a long period of time to receive it.

Torsten says, “Do what you like, but I’m too busy to mess aro und with coupons and rebates.”  To “mess around,” here, means to spend t ime doing something that is not productive, that is not a good use of your t ime.  We also use this expression, to mess around, in talking about children wh o are misbehaving, who are playing and perhaps causing problems.  It can also be used in a sexual way; to mess around may be to engage in some sort of sexual act ivity.  I’m married, so I wouldn’t know!

Cindy says, “That’s why you married a penny-pincher.”  The term “penny- pincher” refers to someone who doesn’t like to spend mone y, who always is looking for the lowest price for something.  Cindy says, “I f I left it up to you (meaning if you were in charge of the situation), we’d  be in the poorhouse by now!”  The “poorhouse” is a place where, many years ago, very poor people would go for help when they didn’t have enough money  or they didn’t have a place to eat.  Poorhouses were common, for example, in t he 19th century in England.  If you read a novel by Charles Dickens, he oft en talks about these poorhouses.  They were not very nice places to be.  Here, Cindy is using the expression just to mean we would be poor, we would not  have very much money.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Torsten:  What are you doing, clipping coupons?  That’s a  waste of time.

Cindy:  You can think what you like, but these days, we have  to cut corners wherever we can.

Torsten:  No one actually saves much money using coupons.

Cindy:  That’s what you think.  The last time I went to the grocery store, I saved over $20 just by using coupons.

Torsten:  How can you keep track of all of the expiration  dates and the terms and conditions?  It’s not worth the trouble.

 Cindy:  Do you feel that way about rebate offers, too?  A month ago, I bought our new TV and saved 20 percent.  And yesterday, I bought a  pack of DVDs for just $2.

Torsten:  Are you putting me on?  A pack of DVDs for $2?

Cindy:  Yeah, it was a great offer, but it was only for  one day.  I had to cut out the UPC code, fill out a form, and mail it in with the r eceipt to the manufacturer. Then, I sent a copy of the receipt to the retailer a nd got another discount.  That’s how I got the DVDs for next to nothing.

Torsten:  You might save money with rebates, but you have to sit around forever waiting for the rebate check.

Cindy:  It’s true that the turnaround is often 8-10 we eks, but some of the offers are worth the wait.

Torsten:  Do what you like, but I’m too busy to mess aroun d with coupons and rebates.

Cindy:  That’s why you married a penny-pincher.  If I le ft it up to you, we’d be in the poorhouse by now!

# Describing Aches and Pains

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 35: Describing Aches and Pains.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 435.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can download a L earning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even fast er.

This episode is called “Describing Aches and Pains.”  It’s a dialogue between Nivia and Michael that uses a lot of vocabulary we use whe n talking about the body and when we have pain in our body.  Sounds like fun !  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nivia:  Why are you walking funny?

Michael:  Oh, I pulled a muscle in my right leg while p laying with my kids last weekend.  It’s hard to walk without feeling a twinge of pain.

Nivia:  I’m sorry to hear that.  Why are you sitting in t hat awkward position?

Michael:  I strained my back while exercising.  Initially, I  felt a sharp pain and I thought it was something serious, but it doesn’t hurt m uch now.  There’s just a dull pain when I sit up straight.  That’s why I’m sittin g like this, leaning to the side.

Nivia:  That’s too bad.  Why are you holding your arms t hat way?

Michael:  I got up in the middle of the night last n ight to go to the bathroom and bumped into the door.  I got a huge bruise on my arm.   It feels better if I hold it over my head.

Nivia:  Why are you shaking your fingers that way?

Michael:  I helped my daughter finish her science project for school.  I – I mean we – glued over 100 wooden sticks together.  My fingers a re really sore and stiff, and they won’t stop throbbing.

 Nivia:  I’m afraid to ask you any more questions.  I don’ t think any man could survive any more injuries than what you already have!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Nivia saying to Michael, “Why are you walking funny?” Here, “funny” just means unusual, oddly, we might even say “weirdly.”  “Why are you walking funny?” – why are you not walking normally?  M ichael said, “Oh, I pulled a muscle in my right leg while playing with my kid s last weekend.”  To “pull a muscle” means to hurt a part of your body – in your arm s, in your legs, in your back, in your neck, wherever you have a muscle.  The “muscle” is what connects bones together, and allows you to move your bones.  So, “ pulling a muscle” means injuring or harming your muscle.  Michael says, “It’s hard to walk without feeling a twinge of pain.”  Well, “pain,” you probab ly know, is when something feels uncomfortable; it hurts.  A “twinge” is a sudden feeling, but it doesn’t last very long.  So, Michael is saying he feels twinges of pain  when he walks; it’s not constant, it’s not all the time but it happens quickly and  then it goes away.

Nivia says, “I’m sorry to hear that.  Why are you sitting in  that awkward position?” “Awkward” means not relaxed, uncomfortable.  Michael says, “I strained my back while exercising.”  To “strain” (strain) means to hurt p art of your body because you were working too hard or because you tried to do som ething that was too difficult.  I never strain my back because I never work too hard!  But Michael strained his back while exercising.  “Initially,” he says, “I  felt a sharp pain.” “Sharp,” here, means very strong; it may not last for a l ong time, but it’s a very strong pain.  We might say it’s a very “acute” (acute) pain .  He says he “felt a sharp pain, and thought it was something serious, but it  doesn’t hurt much now.” Now, he says, “There’s just a dull (dull) pain” when he tries to sit up straight – when he tries to sit normally.  “Dull” is the opposite of sharp; it describes a pain that is not strong, but it lasts a long time.  “Dull” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the wonderful Learn ing Guide that Dr. Lucy Tse prepares for some additional explanations.

Michael says that’s the reason, or  “That’s why I’m sitting like this, leaning to the side.”  To “lean” (lean) means to put your body in one  direction, not straight. You’re usually resting against another object, such as the wall.  So, if you lean against the wall, you’re standing up but your shoulders are touching the wall; the wall is supporting you.  In English, people refer to the famous tower in the City of

 Pisa, in Italy, as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, because the  building is not vertical completely.  It goes off to one side; it leans to one sid e.

Nivia says, “That’s too bad (that’s unfortunate).  Why are  you holding your arms that way?”  Michael says, “I got up in the middle of the night last night to go to the bathroom and bumped into the door.”  To “bump into”  something means to accidentally hit something with your body.  Normally, you d on’t bump into a thing on purpose; you’re not trying to do it.  The expression “ to bump into” can also means something very different if you are talking about a person.  You may say, “I bumped into an old friend of mine at the coffee sh op yesterday.”  There, it means I met or saw someone that I wasn’t expecting to s ee; I wasn’t planning on it, it just was a coincidence.

Well, poor Michael bumped into the door and he got a  huge bruise on his arm.  A “bruise” (bruise) is an often painful spot on your skin.  Usually it has a different color; it’s either dark purple, or brown, maybe even a l ittle green.  It’s caused by bleeding underneath your skin – there’s blood underneat h the skin.  It often happens when you are hit very hard by someone or by someth ing.  If you are in a fight – a physical fight with someone and that person hi ts you, for example, with their fist – with their hands, you may have a bruise the next day, you may have this spot on your skin.

So, Michael has a bruise on his arm.  Nivia says, “Why are you shaking your fingers that way?”  Michael says, “I helped my daughter finish her science project for school.”  Young children are often given “homework,”  things to do at home for their school.  A “science project” is usually something that  you make at home that shows some sort of scientific principle or applies some sort of scientific principle (idea).  Parents often help their children with their  schoolwork, including their science projects.  Michael says, “I – I mean we...” – of cou rse, the child should be doing the project but parents sometimes do more than t he child does.  He says, “I – I mean we – glued over 100 wooden sticks together. ”  To “glue” something means to connect two things or to make two things stick tog ether using a white liquid (or a clear liquid) that will dry between the two pieces and keep them together.  You often use glue, for example, in school.  Children will use glue to put pieces of paper together, or other things.  This is a science project where they had to glue some small wooden sticks.  For some reason , these are popular in schools.  They’re sometimes called “popsicle sticks” because it’s the same small wooden stick that you get with a certain kind of fr ozen desert called a “Popsicle.”

 Well, Michael was gluing together all these sticks, and hi s fingers got very sore and stiff.  “Sore” (sore) means in pain, usually because yo u’ve worked your part of the body too hard – the part that is sore.  It’s wha t may happen, for example, after you strain – after you work your arms or your legs to o hard.  Let’s say you’re running and you’re not used to running, the next day you r muscles may be sore – they may hurt.  “Sore” has a couple of different meani ngs in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanation s.  “Stiff” means unable to move easily, inflexible – not flexible.  So, your arm ma y be stiff, that means it’s hard to move it up and down or left and right because you injured it – because you hurt it.  He says his fingers “won’t stop throbbing.”   To “throb” means to have pain that starts and stops repeatedly, almost like in a r hythm.  So if you hit your thumb, for example, it may hurt – it may throb.  It ma y have this strange sort of pulse, sort of rhythm that causes you pain.

Nivia says, “I’m afraid to ask you any more questions.  I don ’t think any man could survive any more injuries than what you already have!”   To “survive” means to continue to exist even though it’s a difficult situati on.  An “injury” is a problem with some part of your body, usually caused by an accident, or, perhaps, someone was fighting you.  If you run too fast and you hu rt your legs, that would be an injury.  Or, in the case of Michael, if he was str aining his fingers and now they’re sore, that could be called an injury.

One more thing before we conclude: the name of this ep isode was “Describing Aches and Pains.”  An “ache” is a kind of pain; usually it’ s a dull pain.  It’s not necessarily serious, however.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nivia:  Why are you walking funny?

Michael:  Oh, I pulled a muscle in my right leg while p laying with my kids last weekend.  It’s hard to walk without feeling a twinge of pain.

Nivia:  I’m sorry to hear that.  Why are you sitting in t hat awkward position?

Michael:  I strained my back while exercising.  Initially, I  felt a sharp pain and I thought it was something serious, but it doesn’t hurt m uch now.  There’s just a dull pain when I sit up straight.  That’s why I’m sittin g like this, leaning to the side.

 Nivia:  That’s too bad.  Why are you holding your arms t hat way?

Michael:  I got up in the middle of the night last n ight to go to the bathroom and bumped into the door.  I got a huge bruise on my arm.   It feels better if I hold it over my head.

Nivia:  Why are you shaking your fingers that way?

Michael:  I helped my daughter finish her science project for school.  I – I mean we – glued over 100 wooden sticks together.  My fingers a re really sore and stiff, and they won’t stop throbbing.

Nivia:  I’m afraid to ask you any more questions.  I don’ t think any man could survive any more injuries than what you already have!

[end of dialogue]

We hope the script for this episode did not cause you any pain.  It was written by the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Dealing With an Angry Client

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 36: Dealing With an Angry Client.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 436.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide, an 8 to 10 page guide we provide for all of our current episodes t hat includes all of the vocabulary words, definitions, new sample sentences, additio nal definitions, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a complete tr anscript of everything we say on this episode.  While you’re on our website, you can also take a look at our ESL Podcast Store, which has some additional courses you may be interested in, in daily and business English.

This episode is called “Dealing With an Angry Client.”  It’s a phone conversation between Shawna and Monty, and, well, let’s just say they have some problems. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Shawna:  Hello, Shawna Davis.

Monty:  Hello, Shawna.  This is Monty Lofti at BMC.  I need to talk to you about our ad that ran in your newspaper yesterday.

Shawna:  Sure, Monty.  Was there a problem?

Monty:  Yes, there certainly was a problem.  Instead of  the picture of our model, there was a picture of a dog!

Shawna:  That’s awful!  I wasn’t aware of the substitut ion.  On behalf of the newspaper, I sincerely apologize for the error.

Monty:  I don’t think you understand the magnitude of the problem.  Our slogan is: “Look in the mirror and this could be you!”  Now do you get it?  Our store is a laughingstock!

 Shawna:  I can’t tell you how sorry we are for this egr egious mistake.  We will certainly run a correction in tomorrow’s paper, and we w ill run a corrected version of your ad.  That’s the least we can do.  Is there anythi ng else we can do to make amends for our mistake?

Monty:  Yes, there is.  I’d like the person responsible to be called on the mat for this.

Shawna:  Rest assured.  We take this matter very seriously.  We’ll find out who is responsible and heads will roll.

Monty:  Good.  That’s what I wanted to hear.

[end of dialogue]

This conversation begins with Shawna saying, “Hello, Shawn a Davis.”  Monty says, “Hello, Shawna.  This is Monty Lofti at BMC (the na me of his company).  I need to talk to you about our ad that ran in your newsp aper yesterday.”  The “ad” is the advertisement – the announcement for their compan y.  We say something “ran” in the newspaper when we mean it was in the new spaper – it appeared in the newspaper.

So, Monty is calling Shawna, who works for the newspaper.   Monty is a “client” of Shawna’s, meaning that he is buying some sort of service or  product from Shawna.  Shawna says, “Sure, Monty.  Was there a problem ?”  Monty says, “Yes, there certainly was a problem.”  The use of the wo rd “certainly,” here, means definitely, clearly, without any doubt.  It’s used t o emphasize that yes, there was a problem.  Monty says, “Instead of the picture  of our model (a man or a woman who is in the advertisement), there was a pictu re of a dog!”

Shawna says, “That’s awful!” – that’s horrible, that’s te rrible.  “That’s awful!  I wasn’t aware of the substitution.”  A “substitution” i s when you replace one thing for another, when you use one thing in and other thin g’s place.  Shawna says, “On behalf of the newspaper, I sincerely apologize for t he error.”  The expression “on behalf of” means that you are representing that p erson or organization; you are doing it for them.  On behalf of everyone at ESL Podcast, I thank you for listening.  That means I’m representing – I’m speaking for everybody else on the podcast.  Shawna says, “On behalf of the newspaper, I since rely apologize.” “Sincerely” means honestly, openly, really.  It’s a formal term, here, that means that I honestly apologize; I am very sorry.

 Monty says, “I don’t think you understand the magnitude of  the problem.” “Magnitude,” here, just means the size or amount of some thing.  So, it’s a large problem is probably what Monty is saying here.  “Magnitud e” has a number of different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that word.  Monty says, “Our slogan (the  slogan of the company) is: ‘Look in the mirror and this could be you!’”  A “slog an” is a short phrase that often appear in advertisements, usually trying to make peo ple to buy something or perhaps to vote for someone in an election.  Politica l candidates have slogans. Coca-Cola company had a slogan: “It’s the real thing.”  That was their advertising slogan to get people to buy Coca-Cola.

Well, the slogan for Monty’s company is: “Look in the mirr or and this could be you!” meaning what you see in the mirror could be you.  Monty says, “Now do you get it (now do you fully understand what I am talki ng about)?  Our store is a laughingstock!”  Monty is saying that his store (his company) is now a laughingstock.  The word “laughingstock” means someone has d one something very silly or stupid, so everyone is laughing at him.  You don’t want to be the laughingstock – the person that everyone laughs at – and that’s what Monty says has happened here.

Shawna says, “I can’t tell you how sorry we are for this e gregious mistake.”  “I can’t tell you” is an expression that we use to show that yo u know this is a very big or important problem, and you are not able to exp ress completely what you want to say because it is so big, because it is so serious.  S o, she’s trying to make Monty happier, trying to calm him down perhaps, by saying “I can’t tell you how sorry we are for this egregious mistake.”  “Egregious ” (egregious) means a very bad, obvious mistake or problem, something that you can not possibly hide.

Shawna says, “We will certainly run a correction in tomorr ow’s paper,” meaning they will publish (they will print) in the newspaper to morrow a correction to the ad.  “That’s the least we can do,” she says.  The expressio n “it’s the least I can do” is a phrase used to show that you are very willing to do something, even though it is small or unimportant.  So, you go to a h otel, and the hotel does not have your reservation even though you called that day to make one, and the hotel manager says, “I’m very sorry.  The least I can do is give you a free dinner.” It doesn’t make up for the entire problem, but it’s a small or smaller thing that you are saying that you will do.  Shawna says, “Is there anythi ng else we can do to make amends for our mistake?”  The expression “to make ame nds” (amends)

 means to do something to show that you are sorry for wha t mistake you have committed

Monty says, “Yes, there is.  I’d like the person responsible to be called on the mat for this.”  “To be called on the mat” (mat) means to b e held responsible for something, to be punished for having done something wro ng.  Shawna says, “Rest assured,” which is a formal expression that means do n’t worry.  “We take this matter very seriously.  We’ll find out who is responsi ble and heads will roll.” This expression, “heads will roll,” means that people who  have done something wrong will lose their jobs – will be punished.  Usuall y it means they will be fired, so if your boss says, “I’m going to find out who made this mistake and heads will roll,” and you made the mistake, well, you might want t o start looking for another job!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Shawna:  Hello, Shawna Davis.

Monty:  Hello, Shawna.  This is Monty Lofti at BMC.  I need to talk to you about our ad that ran in your newspaper yesterday.

# Having a Best Friend

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 37: Having a Best Friend.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 437.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8 to 10 page guide that will help you im prove your English even faster.

This episode is called “Having a Best Friend.”  It’s a dia logue between Lucy and her friend Buddy.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lucy:  I’m so excited!  My friend, Marlene, is coming to t own for a visit.

Buddy:  Have I met Marlene?

Lucy:  No, I don’t think so.  We grew up together and we were always joined at the hip.

Buddy:  When I was little, I had a friend like that.  We were blood brothers.

Lucy:  Yeah, Marlene and I did everything together and she was my confidant about everything.

Buddy:  She sounds like a great friend.

Lucy:  Yeah, she always had my back and I could always count on her to give it to me straight.

Buddy:  A friend like that is hard to come by.  Are you st ill close?

Lucy:  Not as close as I’d like.  We live in different citi es and it’s hard to keep up with what’s happening in each other’s lives.

 Buddy:  I can see that.  Does she know you’re getting marr ied?

Lucy:  No, I wanted to break the news to her face-to-face .

Buddy:  Why?  I would have thought you’d want to tell h er the good news right away.

Lucy:  Well, I want her to be my maid of honor and I’m  not sure how she’ll react to the dress she’ll have to wear.

Buddy:  Is it that bad?

Lucy:  My future mother-in-law picked it out and I can’t say “no.”  Here’s a picture of it.

Buddy:  Well, I’m glad she’s such a good friend, because i f anything can break up a friendship, it’s that  dress.

[end of dialogue]

Lucy begins by says, “I’m so excited!  My friend, Marlene, is coming to town for a visit.”  She’s going to be coming to the city or town wh ere Lucy lives.  Lucy is talking to her friend Buddy; Buddy is his name.  “Buddy” is also a general term to describe a friend.  This is a term that children will of ten use, especially boys. They’ll say, “He’s my buddy” – he’s my friend.  But here, B uddy is his name.

Buddy says, “Have I met Marlene?”  Lucy says, “No, I don’t t hink so.  We grew up together and we were always joined at the hip.”  “ To grow up” means to get older, from childhood to adulthood.  It’s that period  between when you’re born and when you become an adult at 18 or 19.  “To grow u p together,” then, means to have lived in the same area, to have gone to the same  schools perhaps, and so forth.

Lucy says that she and Marlene were always joined at the hi p.  The “hip” (hip) is the part of your body that’s in the center where your w aist is, that is, where your legs meet the rest of your body.  The expression “to be jo ined at the hip” means to very close to someone else, in fact, you’re always with t hat person; you are inseparable; you spend a lot of time with that person.  “To be joined” means, here, to be connected.  So it is as if your bodies were co nnected.

 Buddy says, “When I was little, I had a friend like that.   We were blood brothers.” Your “blood brother” is a boy or a man with whom you have a very strong friendship.  Again, it’s something that would happen b etween boys or between men.  It’s your best friend, you say “he’s my blood brothe r” – he’s my best friend. You don’t mean your actual brother, the son of your mot her and father; it’s your best friend.

Lucy says, “Yeah, Marlene and I did everything together an d she was my confidant about everything.”  “Confidant” is a person w ith whom you can share your secrets, a person to whom you can say anything.  Someone  you can trust – your confidant.

Lucy says that Marlene was her confidant.  Buddy says, “She so unds like a great friend.”  Lucy says, “Yeah, she always had my back and I coul d always count on her to give it to me straight.”  “To have someone’s ba ck” means to defend someone, to help someone.  More generally, to look out for someone’s interests, to make sure that nothing bad happens to them.  You ma y be in a meeting, and your coworker is giving a presentation and he gets a lot of difficult questions. You decide to help him by answering some of the tough q uestions.  After the meeting, he says to you, “Thanks for having my back” – thanks f or defending and helping me.  Lucy also says that she can count on Marlene.  “To count on” someone is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to trust some one, to believe that someone will do something.  Your boss may say, “I’m counti ng on you to do a good job” – I’m relying on you; I am trusting you to d o a good job.

So, Lucy can count on Marlene “to give it to me straight. ”  “To give it to someone straight” means to tell someone the truth, even if it isn’t pleasant, even if it is difficult.  If someone asks you, “Tell me what you think of this shirt, give it to me straight,” that means they want your honest opinion even if it is not a good one.

So, Lucy’s friend always gives it to her straight.  Buddy says,  “A friend like that is hard to come by.”  “To be hard to come by” means to be  difficult to find or get; to be uncommon – not common.  Things that are hard to come  by are rare.  There was a famous short story in English by the Southern writer  Flannery O’Connor: A Good Man is Hard to Find .  We could say “a good man is hard to come by.”

Buddy says, “Are you still close?” meaning are you and Marl ene still close. “Close,” here, means do you have a comfortable, tight re lationship, especially between friends.  You may say, “Oh, I grew up with Steve  but we’re not close anymore” – we’re not that connected, we don’t talk to e ach other very often, and

 so forth.  “Close” has a couple of different meanings i n English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lucy responds by saying, “Not as close as I’d like.  We live in different cities and it’s hard to keep up with what’s happening in each oth er’s lives.”  “To keep up with something” means to be informed about something, to know what is happening, what changes are happening with something.  Someone says, “I don’t keep up with the news,” or “I don’t keep up with  the news about the economy.”  What they’re saying is they don’t know the late st, they don’t understand or they don’t know about what has changed or  happened in that particular area.

Lucy is saying it’s hard for her to keep up with what is ha ppening in Marlene’s life, to know the changes that are taking place, because they live in different cities.  Buddy says, “I can see that (meaning I understand).   Does she know you’re getting married?”  Lucy says, “No, I wanted to bre ak the news to her face- to-face.”  “To break the news” means to announce somethin g or to tell someone something usually, but not always, unpleasant or unexpect ed.  It could be just a surprise.  Sometimes if it’s bad news, the person will say, “Well, I hate to break the news to you, but...” and then they’ll tell you.  T hat expression, “I hate to break the news,” can also be used as a joke, meaning what you are telling them is something that is obvious: “I hate to break the news to yo u, but this is 2008.”  Of course, it’s obvious that it’s 2008, so the person is making  a joke.  Lucy is not making a joke; she’s going to give this surprise news to h er friend face-to-face. “Face-to-face” just means in person, in a situation wher e the two people are next to each other; they can see each other, not by phone or  email.  “Face-to-face” means that you are physically present in the same place – the same room – as the other person.

Buddy says, “Why?  I would have thought you’d want to tell  her the good news right away.”  Buddy is saying: “I thought you would want to tell her right away.” Lucy says, “I want her to be my maid of honor and I’m not  sure how she’ll react to the dress she’ll have to wear.”  The “maid of honor” i s usually the best friend of a woman who is getting married, and is part of what we call the “wedding party,” the group of people who are witnesses – supporters of t he person getting married.  Usually, the maid of honor has to wear a dre ss that the bride will typically pick out for her – will select for her.  Lucy says she ’s afraid how Marlene will react to the dress she has to wear.  Buddy says, “Is it that bad (is it very bad)?”  Lucy says, “My future mother-in-law picked it out a nd I can’t say ‘no.’” “To pick it out” means to select it, to choose it.  The ex pression has a couple of

 different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

So, her future “mother-in-law,” the mother of the m an she’s going to marry, selected the dress.  She shows buddy a picture of it, and B uddy says, “Well, I’m glad she’s such a good friend, because if anything can bre ak up a friendship, it’s that dress.”  In other words, the dress is really ugly and B uddy is saying: “Well, I’m glad you are good friends because if you were not, a sking someone to wear that dress would break up their friendship.”  “To bre ak up a friendship” or “to break up a marriage” means to end it, to ruin it.  “T o break up” can also mean to separate from someone, especially two people who are da ting.  They’re not married yet, they are boyfriend and girlfriend, and th en they decide to break up. They separate; they go and find new boyfriends and new g irlfriends.  Or, they go home and drink and watch baseball!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lucy:  I’m so excited!  My friend, Marlene, is coming to t own for a visit.

Buddy:  Have I met Marlene?

Lucy:  No, I don’t think so.  We grew up together and we were always joined at the hip.

Buddy:  When I was little, I had a friend like that.  We were blood brothers.

Lucy:  Yeah, Marlene and I did everything together and she was my confidant about everything.

Buddy:  She sounds like a great friend.

Lucy:  Yeah, she always had my back and I could always count on her to give it to me straight.

Buddy:  A friend like that is hard to come by.  Are you st ill close?

Lucy:  Not as close as I’d like.  We live in different citi es and it’s hard to keep up with what’s happening in each other’s lives.

 Buddy:  I can see that.  Does she know you’re getting marr ied?

Lucy:  No, I wanted to break the news to her face-to-face .

Buddy:  Why?  I would have thought you’d want to tell h er the good news right away.

Lucy:  Well, I want her to be my maid of honor and I’m  not sure how she’ll react to the dress she’ll have to wear.

Buddy:  Is it that bad?

Lucy:  My future mother-in-law picked it out and I can’t say “no.”  Here’s a picture of it.

Buddy:  Well, I’m glad she’s such a good friend, because i f anything can break up a friendship, it’s that  dress.

# Renting an Apartment

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 38: Renting an Apartment.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 438.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today’s episode is a dialogue between Heather and Sam,  talking about renting an apartment.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Heather:  Hi, are you the apartment manager?  I saw the vacancy sign outside and I’m looking for an apartment.

Sam:  Yes, I’m Sam.  We have one unit available right now.  When are you looking to move in?

Heather:  The lease on my apartment is up soon, so I’d like to move in the first of the month.

Sam:  Okay, follow me and let me show you the unit.  Ea ch unit gets one parking space in the garage, and there are laundry facilities o n the first floor.  The landlord pays for the gas, but the tenant pays for all other utilities.  Here’s the unit.  Take a look around.

Heather:  Oh, this is nice.  Is this a furnished unit?

Sam:  It can be furnished or unfurnished, your choice.  S ince it’s an end unit, there’s only one common wall.

Heather:  This apartment is exactly what I’m looking for .  How much is the rent?

 Sam:  It’s $900 a month and we require a 12-month le ase.  To move in, you’ll need to have the first and last month’s rent, plus a secur ity deposit.

Heather:  How much is the security deposit?

Sam:  It’s $450.

Heather:  Okay, I’ll think it over and get back to you.  Thanks for your time.

Sam:  These units go fast, so if you’re interested, I su ggest that you jump on it.

Heather:  Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind.

[end of dialogue]

Heather begins the dialogue by asking Sam, “Are you the apartment manager?” In an apartment building – which is, of course, a build ing with many different places for people to live – the manager is the person wh o takes care of the building, the person who takes care of problems in the building.  Heather says, “I saw the vacancy sign outside and I’m looking for an apartme nt.”  The “vacancy (vacancy) sign” is a sign that says that there is a room or ro oms for rent – that are available.  You will see a vacancy sign, for example, in front of a hotel; that means the hotel has rooms to rent.  If it says “no vacancy,” it has no rooms to rent.  For an apartment building, a vacancy sign means t hat there is at least one apartment that is available to rent.

Sam says, “Yes, I’m Sam.  We have one unit available righ t now.”  A “unit,” in this dialogue, means one of the apartments; it refers to an  apartment.  Sometimes people may even say an “apartment unit,” or just “the u nit.”  It’s a term that you will hear more from someone who works in the apartment  business, like a manager, or someone who works in real estate.  “Unit” h as several different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Sam says, “When are you looking to move in?” meaning whe n do you want to – when are you looking to move in.  “To move in” means th at you want to take all of your furniture and things, and bring them to the apar tment to live.  When do you want to start renting the apartment?  Heather says, “Th e lease on my apartment is up soon.”  A “lease” (lease) is a legal contract – a le gal agreement – between, in this case, the person who owns the apartment building  and you, the person

 renting the apartment.  You can have a lease for a hou se; you can have a lease for a car.  You can rent your car for a day or a week or  several months.  The lease on Heather’s apartment is up soon.  “To be up,” i n this case, means to end, to finish, to expire: “The president’s term is up in Janu ary of next year.”  The term is up – the term is over; it is finished.  Heather says, “I ’d like to move in the first of the month,” meaning the first day of the month, so Janu ary 1st or February 1st, and so forth.  In the U.S., it’s common for leases to begin at the first of the month; sometimes they begin on the 15th of the month, so halfway into the month.

Sam says, “Okay, follow me and let me show you the unit.  Each unit gets one parking space in the garage,” meaning one place for you to park one car.  He also says that there are laundry facilities on the first f loor.  “Laundry” is another word for clothes that you want to wash – dirty clothes.  Someone says “I have to go do the laundry,” they mean “I have to go wash my cloth es.”  So, “laundry facilities” are washers and dryers for clothing.  Many apar tment buildings in the U.S. have laundry facilities in the building.  If there  is no laundry facility – place for you to wash your clothes – then you have to go to what ’s called a “Laundromat,” which is a place separate from the build ing that anyone can come and wash their clothes and dry them.

Sam says, “The landlord pays for the gas, but the tenant pays for all other utilities.”  The “landlord” is the person who actually o wns the apartment building, or the house, or whatever is being rented.  A business bu ilding would have a landlord, for example.  The “manager” is the person wh o takes care of the problems – the day-to-day problems – the everyday problems in the building, but the landlord is the person who actually owns the buildin g.  The “tenant” (tenant) is the person who is renting the apartment or the hou se.  So in this case, it would be Heather; she wants to rent the unit from the landl ord.

So the landlord pays for the gas – the natural gas, but  the tenant pays for all other utilities.  The word “utilities,” when we’re ta lking about apartments or houses, refers to the water, the electricity, the gas, oth er things that a person needs to live on; things that are services provided by some co mpany or by the government.  So, for example, for my house we have a g as bill, we have an electricity bill; those are utilities.  We also have a w ater bill and a bill for the garbage collection.  So, these things must be paid for b y Heather.

Sam says, “Here’s the unit.  Take a look around.”  Heathe r says, “Oh, this is nice. Is this a furnished unit?”  When something is “furnished, ” that means that it has furniture in there, that the landlord has put in a b ed, and a sofa, and a table and

 chairs, and so forth.  Most apartments in the U.S., howe ver, are “unfurnished,” meaning they’re empty; you have to bring your own thing s into the apartment. Sam says, “It can be furnished or unfurnished, your choice. ”  Furnished is more common for apartments for students, who may not have thin gs to move into the apartment – furniture – especially if they live in a dif ferent city from where they are renting.

Sam says, “Since it’s an end unit (meaning it’s at the ed ge of the building – there isn’t another apartment on the other side), there’s on ly one common wall.”  A “common wall” is a wall that you share with another apa rtment.  So, if you have an apartment on the first floor in between two other  apartments, you probably have at least two common walls: one for the apartment o n the right, one for the apartment on the left.  Hopefully, the walls are thick so you don’t hear the person next to you.  That’s sometimes a problem with apartments,  especially the apartments I used to rent when I was renting back as a st udent.

Heather says, “This apartment is exactly what I’m looking f or (it’s just what I want).  How much is the rent (how much money do I have to pay each month)?” Sam says, “It’s $900 a month and we require a 12-month lease.”  So she must agree to rent it for a whole year at $900 each month.   “To move in,” Sam says, “you’ll need to have the first and last month’s rent, p lus a security deposit.” That’s a very common policy in the U.S.  If you are going to rent an apartment for one year, you have to pay the first and the last month’s rent right away, as well as a security deposit.  A “security deposit” is money that you  give the owner of the property – the landlord – to hold in case there are any problems, in case, for example, that you damage the apartment.  The word “se curity,” here, doesn’t mean safety; it means something that I am holding of you rs just to be sure that nothing goes wrong.  So, the security deposit that Heat her has to pay is $450. Security deposits are usually about half of the rent, som etimes less.

Heather says, “Okay, I’ll think it over (I’ll think about it) and get back to you.”  “To get back to someone” means to give an answer to someone at  a later time. Someone asks you to go to a party, and you say, “Well, I’ ll get back to you on that.  I’ll call you tomorrow.”

Sam says, “These units go fast (meaning they rent quickly),  so if you’re interested, I suggest that you jump on it.”  “To jump o n it” means to do it right away, not to wait.  Especially if you are talking about so mething you are going to buy or something that you have to pay for, if someone sa ys “you should really

 jump on it,” it’s a good deal – it’s a good price.  Th at is the meaning of the expression, to do it right away.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Heather:  Hi, are you the apartment manager?  I saw the vacancy sign outside and I’m looking for an apartment.

Sam:  Yes, I’m Sam.  We have one unit available right now.  When are you looking to move in?

# Talking about Censorship

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 39: Talking About Censorship.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 439.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Talking About Censorship.”  It’s a  story about a parent who goes to a school, the school for their children, and  the parents have a meeting and they’re discussing what to do about certain b ooks that are in the school’s library or that the teachers are using.  This is of ten a problem in the U.S., some parents may not like the books that the childre n are being asked to read or that are available to them.  Let’s get starte d. > The school that my daughter attends is trying to decide w hether or not to ban certain books, which some parents think are inappropriate.   The school called a parents meeting to talk over the issue.
> At the meeting, one woman said: “The books on this list  are obscene!  I don’t want my children reading that filth!”
> Another parent responded: “That’s absurd!  Haven’t you e ver heard of free speech?  Banning books violates everything we Americans bel ieve in.”
> Another parent said: “I don’t like the way this book po rtrays history.  To me, it’s morally objectionable.”
> Still another parent complained: “There is too much g raphic violence in these books and I won’t allow my son to be exposed to it.”
> A parent stood up and yelled: “People who want to ban  books are fear mongering.  They don’t give our kids enough credit.”
> Our story is called “Talking About Censorship.”  “Censorshi p” means not allowing certain things to be seen or heard or published because y ou don’t like the ideas that are in that thing, or perhaps the visual images th at are part of that thing. Censorship usually is considered a negative thing, at lea st in American society, but of course, it all depends on who you talk to.

The story begins by saying that the school that my daughter  attends (my daughter goes to – is a student at) is trying to decide w hether or not to ban certain books.  “To ban” (ban) means not to allow somet hing to be used, bought, seen, or heard: “The university bans cigarette smoking in a ll of its buildings.” That means that it’s not allowed.  Most restaurants in m any cities in the U.S. have smoking bans; you cannot smoke there.  “To ban” can a lso mean not to allow certain books in the library or certain movies to b e shown in a city or town.

The meeting of the parents, then, is to discuss whether  they should ban certain books from the school – not allow them to be there.  O f course, all schools ban certain books that are, for example, considered pornogr aphic, or magazines that are not appropriate for young children.  So, it rea lly isn’t a question of banning or not banning, it’s deciding which things you’re going to ban.  Some parents think that there are books that are “inappropriate.”  This m eans they are not right for someone in a particular situation.  That could include b ooks that young children, for example, shouldn’t be reading because they’re not ri ght for their age.

The school called a parents meeting to talk over the issue , or to talk the issue over.  “To talk over” something is a phrasal verb meaning  to talk about something, to discuss something.  One woman said, “The bo oks on this list are obscene!”  Something that is “obscene” (obscene) means it is very offensive, it causes people to get angry or upset because it is dirty in a  sexual or a hateful way.  So, pornography, for example, showing sexual scenes of  men and women in certain cases could be considered by some people obscene.   The woman says, “I don’t want my children reading that filth!”  “F ilth” (filth) means dirt or garbage.  Here, it’s being used to say that something is very wrong; something is unclean or disgusting.  When a parent describes a book as being “filth,” they usually mean that it is sexually inappropriate for a give n student.

 Well, another parent said, “That’s absurd!”  Something  that is “absurd” is something that would be illogical – not logical, not rational, silly.  The parent says, “Haven’t you ever heard of free speech?”  “Free speech ,” in the United States, means the freedom or ability to say and write j ust about anything you want.  It’s part of our U.S. Constitution that people  have freedom of speech, or free speech.  The government tries not to limit free sp eech, although free speech is not absolute.  That is, there are cases where things ca nnot be said.  Schools, for example, do not give their students complete freedo m of speech.  This parent says, “Banning books violates everything we Americans believe in.”  “To violate,” here, means to go against something, to break a law or break a rule or break a principle, to go against our beliefs.  It goes against,  or violates, everything we Americans believe in.  “To believe in” means to think tha t something is good; you believe something is correct.

Another parent said, “I don’t like the way this book po rtrays history.”  “To portray” (portray), here, means to represent something, to expre ss something in a certain way; the way something is described or illustrated.  The p arent says, “To me, (this book) is morally objectionable.”  “Moral” refers t o right or wrong; “objectionable” is something that you don’t like, someth ing that you disagree with. So, something “morally objectionable” is something that a person doesn’t believe in, or goes against his or her beliefs of what is right  and wrong.

Another parent complained: “There’s too much graphic violence in these books.” “Graphic violence” is violence that is described or shown in  a lot of detail.  You don’t have to use your imagination; it’s described or sho wn in the book or in the movie.  This parent does not want her child “to be expos ed to it,” meaning to be allowed to see or hear something, not to be protected from something.  The verb “exposed” has a couple of different meanings; take a loo k at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  You’ll also find some  additional meanings of the verb “to ban,” which we talked about at the begin ning of this episode.

Another parent stood up and yelled: “People who want  to ban books are fear mongering.”  “To fear monger” means to use fear to ch ange people’s opinions about something; to frighten people to do something b y talking about the terrible things that will happen, things that they will find f earful, or will be afraid of.  “They don’t give our kids enough credit.”  Not to “give someo ne credit,” or “enough credit,” here means not to believe that someone is capabl e of doing something, or not to think that someone can do something.  If you r friend says to you, “Here, let me talk to that girl and ask her if she wants to go  on a date with you,” you

 might say, “Give me a little credit!” meaning you are n ot believing in my capabilities, you don’t think that I can do something bu t I can.

The story ends: The meeting turned into a shouting matc h.  A “shouting match” is a loud conversation that has people yelling at each other .  They’re trying to express their opinions, but it ends up being more people  yelling and not listening to each other.  So, a shouting match is usually a bad thi ng.  The story ends by the man saying that he’s glad the students, their childr en, were not there because the parents did not act like adults.  They started yelling at each other rather than talking about things in a reasonable way.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal spe ed.

[start of story]

The school that my daughter attends is trying to decide w hether or not to ban certain books, which some parents think are inappropriate.   The school called a parents meeting to talk over the issue.

At the meeting, one woman said: “The books on this list  are obscene!  I don’t want my children reading that filth!”

Another parent responded: “That’s absurd!  Haven’t you e ver heard of free speech?  Banning books violates everything we Americans bel ieve in.”

Another parent said: “I don’t like the way this book po rtrays history.  To me, it’s morally objectionable.”

Still another parent complained: “There is too much g raphic violence in these books and I won’t allow my son to be exposed to it.”

A parent stood up and yelled: “People who want to ban  books are fear mongering.  They don’t give our kids enough credit.”

The meeting turned into a shouting match.  If you ask m e, I’m very glad that none of the students were at this meeting.  They would be le arning an important lesson, but not one that any parent would want!

# Being a Self-Made Man/Woman

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 40: Being a Self- Made Man or Woman.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 440.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can download a L earning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension checks, cultural not es, and a complete transcript of everything you hear on this episode.

This episode is called “Being a Self-Made Man,” or “Bei ng a Self-Made Woman.” It’s a dialogue between Ann and Edgar over what it m eans to become successful.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Edgar:  What a crock!

Ann:  What is it?

Edgar:  I’m reading an article about successful business pe ople who were self- made men and women.  I don’t believe a word of it.

Ann:  What don’t you believe?

Edgar:  These people didn’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps.  They were all born with silver spoons in their mouths.

Ann:  Not all successful people were born into money and privilege.

Edgar:  That’s true, but it gets me riled up when peo ple who grew up at the country club claim to have had humble beginnings.

Ann:  Just because some people were born with a leg up d oesn’t mean they didn’t work hard to get where they are.

 Edgar:  Where would that hard work have gotten them if they didn’t have backers with deep pockets, or if they didn’t know people in high  places?  I know plenty of hard-working people who aren’t hobnobbing with the r ich and famous.

Ann:  That’s true enough.  Who needs the rich and famo us?  I’ll take my hard- working man over any of them any day.

Edgar:  That’s why I married you – a woman with beauty and brains!

[end of dialogue]

In the United States there has always been a belief tha t anyone can be successful, even though that is not always true.  This dialog ue uses some expressions that we often will say to talk about being success ful and the reasons people are successful in life.

The dialogue begins by Edgar saying, “What a crock!”  “Cro ck” (crock) is a very informal expression meaning that something is false, some thing is a lie; you should not believe this thing.  Ann says, “What is it?”  Edgar says, “I’m reading an article about successful business people who were self-made m en and women.  I don’t believe a word of it” – I don’t believe any of it is true.  “Self-made” means that you became successful or rich because you worked hard, n ot because you received help from other people.

Ann asks, “What don’t you believe?”  Edgar says, “These peo ple didn’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps.”  The expression “to pul l yourself up by your bootstraps” means to become successful because of your own eff orts – because of your own work, especially if you started as a very poor p erson or unsuccessful person.  To pull yourself up by your bootstraps means to g et out of this difficult life situation and become rich or successful, without the help of anyone else.

Edgar says, “They were all born with silver spoons in their  mouths.”  He’s talking about the people in the article that he’s reading who  say they are self-made.  But Edgar says no, “They were born with silver spoons in their  mouths.”  This is an expression, “to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth, ” that means that you were born into a rich family, because only a rich family co uld afford a spoon made of silver.  I’m not quite sure why it has to be bo rn with the spoon in your mouth, other than perhaps we feed little babies with small spoons, and put the spoon in their mouth – that makes sense.  So, to be bor n with a silver spoon in your mouth means that you were born a very rich person.  You come from a rich

 family, and therefore you weren’t pulling yourself u p by your bootstraps if you became successful.

Ann says, “Not all successful people were born into money a nd privilege.”  “To be born into money” means that you were born into a rich family.  “Privilege” (privilege) is something that is special for only a small n umber of people – for very few people.  Very few people can have this.  It’s oft en used to mean, simply, “advantage.”  “He has a lot of privileges” – he has a lot of advantages, coming from a rich family.  So, Ann is saying that not all successfu l people were born into money and born into privilege, having these economic, fin ancial advantages. “Privilege” has a couple of different meanings in Engl ish; go to our Learning Guide for this episode for some additional explanations.

Edgar says, “That’s true, but it gets me riled up when p eople who grew up at the country club claim to have had humble beginnings.”  “To b e riled (riled) up” means to be angry, to be upset, to be annoyed.  Edgar says he gets riled up when people who grew up at the country club say that the y come from humble beginnings.  The “country club,” here, refers to a place where members can participate in sports and social activities.  Usually this is a very exclusive club that costs a lot of money to become a member of.  Country clubs  often have golf courses, and require a lot of money if you want to become  a member and use the country club.  In general, when someone says or refers to “the country club,” they’re referring to people who are very rich, people w ho are living in a very rich manner, or rich way.  “Humble beginnings” means that yo u grew up in a family that did not have a lot of money.  “Humble,” here, me ans poor; “beginnings” means when you were a child, so, to have “humble beginni ngs” means that you had a childhood where you lived with a family that was p oor, or grew up with a family that did not have a lot of money.

So, what riles Edgar – what gets him riled up – is tha t people who are rich say they came from poor families.  Ann says, “Just because some  people were born with a leg up doesn’t mean they didn’t work hard to ge t where they are.”  A “leg up,” here, means an advantage, a head start, something that helps you do something faster or better.  If you are, for example, trying to learn French and you already know Spanish and Italian, you have a leg up o n other people who do not know those two romance languages, because Italian, F rench, and Spanish have many similarities.  They are similar languages, so to know one means that you have a leg up on learning the other languages.  “L eg” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

 Edgar says, “Where would that hard work have gotten the m if they didn’t have backers with deep pockets.”  So, Ann is saying, well, just be cause someone is rich doesn’t mean they don’t work hard, or didn’t work h ard to get where they are today.  Edgar is saying, well, they may work hard but that  would not have gotten them their position today if they didn’t have backers.  A “backer” is a supporter, usually someone who gives you money.  If I’m going to star t a new company, I want to start a record company so I can become a famous sing ing star, I would ask for some backers.  I would get people who would invest , or give me money to help me start my new company.

Edgar is saying that these people who are successful have ba ckers – people who give them money, like their parents – with deep pocke ts.  The expression “to have deep pockets” means to be very rich, to have a lot of money.  A “pocket” is what we call that part of your pants that you can put money into, or keys, and so forth.  Usually you have two pockets in front and two po ckets in back.  Edgar says these people would not have been successful if they didn’ t know people in high places.”  “In high places” means people who are po werful or rich or successful, and have a lot of influence.  If someone says to yo u, “I know people in high places,” they mean I know people who are very im portant, who have a lot of influence and therefore could help me.

Edgar says, “I know plenty (I know many) hard-working peo ple who aren’t hobnobbing with the rich and famous.  “To hobnob” (ho bnob) means to spend time talking with people who have a lot of money, powe r, or influence.  We might also say, nowadays, “to network.”  “Network” sounds better than “hobnobbing.” “Hobnobbing” has the idea you are trying to become successf ul by talking to other people and getting them to help you.  “To netw ork” sounds like you are looking for opportunities to become successful.  So, “hobno bbing” is probably considered a little more negatively.  “Networking” is a t erm we use now in the business world to refer to making contacts, getting to know  people who may help us in the future.

Ann says, “That’s true enough.”  She’s agreeing with Edg ar.  “Who needs the rich and famous?  I’ll take my hard-working man over any of t hem any day.”  Edgar says, “That’s why I married you – a woman with beauty and brains!”  Edgar, of course, is complimenting himself, saying his wife is very int elligent because she married him even though he doesn’t have a lot of mone y.

Let’s listen now to the dialogue at a normal speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Edgar:  What a crock!

Ann:  What is it?

Edgar:  I’m reading an article about successful business pe ople who were self- made men and women.  I don’t believe a word of it.

Ann:  What don’t you believe?

Edgar:  These people didn’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps.  They were all born with silver spoons in their mouths.

Ann:  Not all successful people were born into money and privilege.

Edgar:  That’s true, but it gets me riled up when peo ple who grew up at the country club claim to have had humble beginnings.

Ann:  Just because some people were born with a leg up d oesn’t mean they didn’t work hard to get where they are.

Edgar:  Where would that hard work have gotten them if they didn’t have backers with deep pockets, or if they didn’t know people in high  places?  I know plenty of hard-working people who aren’t hobnobbing with the r ich and famous.

Ann:  That’s true enough.  Who needs the rich and famo us?  I’ll take my hard- working man over any of them any day.

Edgar:  That’s why I married you – a woman with beauty and brains!

# Preparing Food for Cooking

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 41: Preparing Food for Cooking.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 441.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can download a L earning Guide for this episode, an 8 to 10 page guide that will help you im prove your English even faster.

This episode is called “Preparing Food for Cooking.”  It ’s going to describe a lot of common vocabulary we use in English to talk about cookin g food.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marissa:  How can I help?

Juan Carlos:  Um...why don’t you iron the tablecloth and  set the table?

Marissa:  I already did that.  I want to help with the  cooking.

Juan Carlos:  Okay, you can scrub these potatoes, peel the ca rrots, and rinse these grapes.

Marissa:  All right, I’ll do that, but I think you’re just giving me the scut work.  I want to do some real cooking.

Juan Carlos:  Well okay, I guess you could cut up this chicken and then chop these vegetables.  After that, you can sauté the vegetable s in this pan.

Marissa:  Great!  Now, how do you sauté?  I’ve never don e it before.

Juan Carlos:  What?!  Forget it.  You can steam the vege tables instead.

Marissa:  Okay, just show me how.

 Juan Carlos:  Never mind.  Here, just beat these eggs and  slice these onions. When you’re done, you can toss that salad.

Marissa:  But I want to whip up some gourmet dishes.  W hen can I cook?

Juan Carlos:  That’s a good question.  Ask me again when you’ve learned how!

[end of dialogue]

The dialogue between Marissa and Juan Carlos begins by Ma rissa saying, “How can I help you,” which is a polite way of someone saying in  what way can I be of assistance – how can I help you with what you are doing.  Juan Carlos says, “Um...why don’t you iron the tablecloth and set the ta ble?”  Juan Carlos is cooking the food and his wife, I guess, is asking if she can help him.  Juan Carlos says, “why don’t you iron the tablecloth?”  “To iron” mea ns to take a piece of clothing or a piece of fabric and put a hot object on it so that it is straight and smooth; it does not have any what we would call “wrinkle s,” or lines in it.  “To iron” is a verb; there’s also the noun “iron,” which is the thing that you heat up, usually nowadays by plugging it in.  It’s an electrical devi ce.  The “tablecloth” is a large cloth – a large piece of fabric that you put over  a table, usually for some sort of formal dining situation.  If you go to a nice r estaurant they will usually have tablecloths.  Juan Carlos also suggests that she set the ta ble.  “To set the table” means to put the plates, cups, napkins, spoons, forks, knives – all of those sorts of things that you need to eat on the table.  Usually,  this is something you do before the person brings out the food to eat.  In my f amily, growing up, it was always my job to set the table for dinner.  Probably beca use that’s the easiest thing for a child to do, and not being the brightest person, my parent’s didn’t want me to make any mistakes!

So, Juan Carlos is asking Marissa to help him.  Marissa says, “I already did that. I want to help with the cooking.”  Juan Carlos says, “Okay, here, you cook the rest of the meal” – no, he doesn’t say that!  He actual ly says, “Okay, you can help, you can scrub these potatoes.”  “To scrub” (scrub) mea ns to move your hand or use some sort of tool and move it back and forth  against something quickly in order to clean it.  So, scrubbing the vegetabl es is putting them under water, rubbing them so that the dirt comes off of them .  Juan Carlos is asking Marissa to scrub the potatoes, peel the carrots, and rinse  these grapes.  “To peel” (peel) is a verb we use in cooking to talk about removing the skin from a fruit or vegetable, to remove the outside of something  usually with a small knife. So, to peel the carrots would mean to use a small knife  or a sharp object that we

 would call a “peeler” to take off the outer layer – t he outer skin of the carrot.  A “carrot” is a long, orange-colored vegetable.  “Rinsing”  the grapes means cleaning them by running water over them.  “Grapes” are , of course, small pieces of fruit from which we make wine – or one way of makin g wine, anyway.  You can use that same verb, “to rinse,” when you are talking abou t, for example, washing your hair.  I could say, “I rinsed my hair this morning wh en I took a shower.”  I could say that, but I don’t have any hair so that would b e a lie!

Marissa says, “All right, I’ll do that, but I think you’re  just giving me the scut work.” “Scut (scut) work” means work that is the most unpleasant to do, the worst job. Someone who gives you scut work is giving you something tha t is usually easy but it’s not very pleasant – it’s not very fun to do.  M arissa says, “I want to do some real cooking.”  Juan Carlos says, “Well okay, I guess you  could cut up this chicken.”  “To cut something up,” or “to cut up something ” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to cut something into smaller pieces, usually with a knife.  “Cut” has several different meanings in English; take a look at  our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Juan Carlos also asks Marissa to chop these vegetables.  “To cho p” (chop) also means to cut something into smaller pieces, usually with a  knife, and with a very quick motion – quick, “repetitive,” we would say, motion; you repeat the same thing over and over again.  So, if you have an onion a nd you want the onion to be in very small, little pieces, you would use a knife and you  would chop the onion; you would move the knife up and down quickly several times,  using the same motion to cut the onion.  “Chop” usually means that you  are making something into very small pieces – you are cutting it into small pie ces.

Juan Carlos says, “After that, you can sauté the vegetabl es in this pan.”  “To sauté” (sauté – with an accent over the “e” because it’s a  word that comes originally from French) means to cook something, often ve getables or meat, in hot oil or butter until it is either soft if it’s veget ables, or browned if it’s meat. Sauté is usually done in a “pan,” which is the thing you put on top of the fire in order to cook food.  Sautéing is usually something that is done very quickly in the pan.

Marissa says, “Great!  Now, how do you sauté,” meaning how  does one sauté – how does someone who cooks sauté.  “I’ve never done it bef ore.”  Juan Carlos says, “What?!  Forget it,” meaning he can’t believe Mari ssa doesn’t know how to sauté.  He says, “You can steam the vegetables instead.”  “ To steam” (steam) something means to cook something by putting it over boil ing water.  It isn’t in the

 water; it’s in something else, but the heat from the b oiling water – the vapor – comes up into the food and cooks it, into the pan or wha tever it is that you are using to put the food in.  But, “steaming” means that you don’t put it in water, but the heat of the water cooks the food.  We often steam vegetables, for example. You could also steam fish.

Juan Carlos is asking Marissa to steam the vegetables, and M arissa says, “Okay, just show me how” – tell me how to do it.  Juan C arlos says, “Never mind,” meaning forget it, don’t worry about it, I do n’t want you to do it.  He says, “Here, just beat these eggs and slice these onions.”  “To beat” an egg, or to beat anything in cooking means to stir something very quickly; to mix it very quickly, often in order to put more air into the food.  “Bea t” has several different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Juan Carlos wants Marissa also to “slice these onions.”  “To  slice” (slice) is another verb we use to refer to cutting something.  Thi s is when you cut something into very thin, flat pieces.  So, you might sl ice the bread.  You have a piece of bread, what we would call a “loaf” (loaf) of  bread, and then you slice it – you cut it so that it is in thin, flat pieces.  “When you’ re done,” Juan Carlos says, “you can toss that salad.”  “To toss” (toss) something is to  mix things together – mix different pieces of food together, to stir them tog ether.  When you toss a salad, you take all of the elements – all of the ingred ients, the food that makes up the salad, and you mix them together.

Marissa says, “But I want to whip up some gourmet dishes.  When can I cook?” “To whip up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to mak e something to eat very quickly, in very little time.  Someone says, “Oh, I’ll whi p up some food for dinner,” they mean they will cook food very quickly or get dinner rea dy very quickly. “Gourmet” (gourmet) means very good tasting, delicious, h igh quality food. “Gourmet dishes” refer to the food that you are cooking .  A “dish” is one type of cooked or prepared food.  At Thanksgiving in the United States, we have different dishes: turkey, potatoes, pumpkin pie – these a re dishes.

Marissa wants to whip up some gourmet dishes.  Juan Carlo s says, “Ask me again when you’ve learned how!” because Marissa doesn’t k now how to do even the most basic things in cooking – kind of like me!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Marissa:  How can I help?

Juan Carlos:  Um...why don’t you iron the tablecloth and  set the table?

Marissa:  I already did that.  I want to help with the  cooking.

Juan Carlos:  Okay, you can scrub these potatoes, peel the ca rrots, and rinse these grapes.

Marissa:  All right, I’ll do that, but I think you’re just giving me the scut work.  I want to do some real cooking.

# Flying on Low-Cost Airlines

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 42: Flying on Low- Cost Airlines.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 442.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can download a Learning Guide for this episode on our website to help you improve your English even fast er.

This episode is a dialogue between Sue and Alex about so mething called “low- cost airlines,” or airlines that do not charge a lot of money for their airline tickets. We’ll talk about some common vocabulary that we use when talking about traveling by air.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sue:  I just made airline reservations for our trip.  D o you want to look over the itinerary before I purchase the tickets?

Alex:  Which airline is it?

Sue:  It’s McTse Air.

Alex:  Oh, no, I don’t want to fly on that low-cost air line!  We don’t get assigned seats and all of the passengers rush the gate when boardi ng begins.  I hate that!

Sue:  Not having assigned seats is a small price to pay for low fares.  The service may be stripped down, but I don’t think the experience is that bad.

Alex:  I don’t mind a no-frills flight, but I don’t want to fly out of some tiny airport that’s an hour away.  Which airport would we be depar ting from?

Sue:  It’s the Burbank Airport.  Yes, I know it’s less con venient to fly out of a secondary airport, but I don’t see what the big deal i s.

Alex:  Okay, hand it over.  I’m taking over the planning for our vacation.  I’m not willing to sacrifice comfort to save a few bucks.

Sue:  Fine, be my guest.

 [end of dialogue]

In our dialogue Sue says to Alex, “I just made airline r eservations for our trip.” “Airlines” are companies that will fly you in an airplan e from one place to another. “Reservations” are arrangements or contracts or agreement s for you to do something at sometime in the future.  So, “airline re servations” are, really, tickets that you buy for a trip you are going to take in the f uture.  Sue says, “Do you want to look over (do you want to look and examine) the itine rary before I purchase the tickets?”  So, Sue hasn’t paid for the tickets; she made a  reservation.  She went, probably online, and said yes, I want this ticket for thi s day.  Usually, the airline will give you 24 hours, for example, to actually purchase (or buy) the tickets.  The “itinerary” (itinerary) is the specific information that says when you are going to leave, when you are going to arrive, and so forth.  The  itinerary can include other details or information also, including where you are go ing and how you are getting there.

Alex says, “Which airline is it?”  Sue says, “It’s McTse Air. ”  Alex says, “Oh, no, I don’t want to fly (I don’t want to travel) on that lo w-cost airline!”  Something that is “low-cost” is something that is not expensive, something t hat is cheap.  Here in the U.S., in Europe, and in other parts of the world  in the last 10 or 15 years there have been many new low-cost airlines that do not charge a lot for the tickets that they sell.  Alex doesn’t like low-cost airlines;  one reason is that you don’t get assigned seats on the plane.  “Assigned seats” are when the airline says what specific seat you can sit in.  Many low-cost airlines , in order to save money, don’t have that system, at least here in the U.S.  You simply go and you take whatever seat is open – that is, is available.

Alex doesn’t like the fact that all of the passengers rush  the gate when boarding begins.  The “passengers” are the people who are traveli ng on the plane.  You can also be a passenger in a bus, on a train, in a car, o n a boat or ship.  “To rush,” in this case, means to do something very quickly.  In this example, “to rush the gate” means to move toward the gate very quickly.  the “gate” is the place where you go through to get onto the airplane; it’s t he place where they take your ticket before you get on the airline, or check your ticket.   So, Alex doesn’t like when passengers rush the gate when boarding begins.  “Bo arding” (boarding) is the process of people getting on the plane.  If they a nnounce that the plane is going to board at 3:00, or begin boarding at 3:00, they mean that that is when people are going to start getting on the airplane.  They will allow people (or let people) go onto the airplane itself and get their sea t.

 Sue says, “Not having assigned seats is a small price to pay for low fares.”  “A small price to pay” is something that is easy to do, especia lly when you consider the advantages of doing it.  So for example, going to the doctor once a year and getting an examination is a small price to pay for your health.  It doesn’t cost that much, it isn’t that inconvenient, and it could save your l ife so it’s a small price to pay.  In this case, Sue says that not having assigned seats is a small price to pay for this greater benefit – this greater advantage, whi ch is lower fares.  A “fare” (fare) is the price of a ticket on an airplane, a train , a bus, or a boat.  “Airfare” refers to the price of the tickets.  So, low fares are low airfares, is what Sue is interested in.

Sue says, “The service may be stripped down, but I don’t t hink the experience is that bad.”  When we say something is “stripped down,” we  mean it only has the very basic or essential things; it doesn’t have a lot of nice , comfortable extra things.  So on a low-cost airline they may give you water but if you want soda you have to pay money, or if you want something to eat you  have to pay extra.

Alex says, “I don’t mind a no-frills flight.”  “No-frill s” means basically the same as stripped down, not a lot of extra or fancy things, only t he basics.  He says, “I don’t want to fly out of some tiny airport that’s an hour awa y.  To fly out of an airport means to leave from that airport; that’s where the pla ne leaves from, where it takes off from.  To fly out of a tiny airport would be a small airport.  Many of the low-cost airlines in Europe and other places will fly ou t of small airports, not the main airport for example, and so, you have to travel far ther than you might otherwise.  Alex says, “Which airport would we be depart ing from?”  To “depart from” somewhere means to leave a place, especially an ai rport – leaving the place: “The plane departs at 5:00; it departs from the  Burbank Airport.”

Well, Sue says, “It’s the Burbank Airport.”  You have to understand a little bit about Southern California; Burbank is north of the ma in part of the city.  It’s north of where I live.  It would be very inconvenient, or at l east somewhat inconvenient, to have to go to Burbank Airport if you live where I l ive in Los Angeles.  Sue says, “I know it’s less convenient to fly out of a secondary airpo rt, but I don’t see what the big deal is.”  A “secondary airport” is an airport that is part of a larger city but is the less important airport.  So for example, in Lond on Heathrow Airport is the main airport and Gatwick would be a secondary airport.  In Los Angeles, Los Angeles International Airport (or LAX, as we call it)  is the main airport; Burbank, Ontario, and Orange County (or the John Wayne) Airpor ts would be secondary airports.

Sues says that she doesn’t know what the big deal is, meani ng she doesn’t know why Alex thinks this is so important.  Alex says, “Okay, hand it over.”  The

 expression “to hand something over” is used to ask someone to  give you something or let you have something, often times in ord er for you to take over or control the situation.  It’s not something that you wou ld say to be polite; it’s not a polite or nice expression.  “Hand it over,” in this case,  means Alex wants to see the itinerary – wants to see the tickets and where and wh en they will be going.

Alex says, “I’m taking over the planning for our vacation.”   To “take over” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to take con trol of something, to begin to be the person who is the boss or organizes someth ing.  Alex says, “I’m not willing to sacrifice comfort to save a few bucks.”  To “sacrifice,” here, means to give up or not to have to do something.  “Bucks” is an  informal expression for a dollar (money) in the U.S.

Sue says, “Fine, be my guest,” meaning okay, you go ahead and you plan the vacation.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sue:  I just made airline reservations for our trip.  D o you want to look over the itinerary before I purchase the tickets?

Alex:  Which airline is it?

# Having a Slumber Party

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 43: Having a Slumber Party.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 443.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You know what you’ll find there: a Learning Guide that can help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Having a Slumber Party.”  It’s a co nversation between Russ and Irene about a party that the girl, Irene, is g oing to have with her friends. It’s a particular kind of party that is very popular especia lly among young girls in the United States.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Russ:  Mom says you’re having a slumber party next Saturday.

Irene:  I’m just having a few friends over for a sleepove r and it’s none of your business.

Russ:  Don’t be like that.  How many people did you invit e?

Irene:  I’m not telling you anything.  I know what you’ re thinking.  You want to pull pranks on us.

Russ:  No, I don’t.  I just want to know how many giggl ing girls in sleeping bags I’ll have to step over to get to the kitchen.

Irene:  You’re not going to get anything out of me.  I can see right through you.

Russ:  Are you going to wear your pajamas with feet?

Irene:  Don’t be stupid!  I haven’t worn those since I was six!

Russ:  Can I be part of the pillow fight?

Irene:  No way!  You’re not invited!

 Russ:  But you’re going to stay up all night and watch mo vies, aren’t you?  I want to do that, too.

Irene:  You’d better stop teasing me or I’m going to tell Mom.

Russ:  I’m not doing anything.  I’m only trying to help you plan your party.

Irene:  Right!  You want to help me?  It’s more like you want to wreck my party.

Russ:  Ah, you’ve hurt my feelings.

Irene:  I doubt it.  Now leave me alone!

[end of dialogue]

The title of this episode is “Having a Slumber (slumber ) Party.”  A “slumber party” is also sometimes called a “sleepover” (one word).  A slumb er party or sleepover is when many children sleep at one of their friend’s ho uses.  Usually, they do this on the weekend, on a Friday or Saturday night, and the kids all come over, maybe three, four, five, or more kids come over and the y bring something to sleep in, a sleeping bag, and they have lots of food and  stay up late at night, and so forth.  The term “slumber party” is usually one more associated with girls than with boys, although it’s possible for both boys and girls t o have this kind of party – this sort of sleepover.  When I was in, oh, fourth or  fifth grade, I remember going over and sleeping at my friend’s house with a coupl e of other friends, and we would stay up late at night and watch movies.  In fact , I think even once we stayed up all night, talking and watching movies and eati ng.  It’s a very popular event for children growing up in the U.S.

Irene is going to have a slumber party and Russ, her brot her, says, “Mom says you’re having a slumber party next Saturday.”  Irene says, “I’m just having a few friends over (meaning I’m having some friends come to our  house) for a sleepover and it’s none of your business.”  The expression “ none of your business” means it’s not something that you need to know ab out, it’s not important for you.  But, we use this expression in a some what hostile or negative sense.  If someone says, “it’s none of your business,” that’s n ot a nice thing to say.  They’re saying that you have no reason or right to kno w this, and it is often said after someone has, perhaps, tried to get informat ion out of you that you don’t want to give them that you think is private.

Russ says, “Don’t be like that,” to his sister.  “Don’t be l ike that” is a phrase we use to ask someone to change his or her attitude – his or her behavior, usually

 when they are angry.  Russ says, “Don’t be like that.  Ho w many people did you invite?”  Irene says, “I’m not telling you anything.”  Of  course, they’re brother and sister so sometimes they don’t get along, they don’t play nice with each other, they’re not friendly to each other.

Irene says, “I know what you’re thinking.  You want to pu ll pranks on us.”  To “pull pranks” (pranks) means to do something to another person, usually something that would be funny or something that would be embar rassing.  It’s playing a joke on someone, often a physical sort of thing.  So for examp le, when I was growing up it was sometimes common for my friends and I to run ar ound in our neighborhood and go up to a house and knock on the d oor or ring the doorbell and then run away and wait for the person to come out,  and of course, no one would be there.  Now, that’s not very funny to me now, but I guess when I was younger it was funny.  That would be a prank that you w ould pull on someone. So we use the verb “to pull” with this particular expressi on.  “Pull” has many different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Russ says, “No, I don’t,” meaning I will not pull pranks o n you and your friends. He says, “I just want to know how many giggling girls in sleeping bags I’ll have to step over to get to the kitchen.”  To “giggle” (giggle)  means to laugh, usually to laugh in very high voice [Jeff giggles].  I can’t do it ve ry well because I’m not a girl.  But girls, especially young girls are often seen or  heard giggling.  Usually it’s because you are embarrassed or because there’s something fun ny that’s happened.  It’s something we associate mostly with young gi rls.  Giggling girls, in this case, will be in sleeping bags.  I mentioned sleepin g bags a few minutes ago; a “sleeping bag” is a long, warm, thick piece of materia l (a fabric) that is filled often with feathers, and it allows you to sleep on the  ground and still stay warm. So, it’s like a big blanket that has a zipper on the sid e so that you can stay warm. It’s often used for camping outdoors, but it could also be used at someone’s house.  When you are sleeping on the floor, you could sl eep in a sleeping bag. So all the kids, when they came over for the slumber part y, would bring their own sleeping bag.  So, Russ says, “I just want to know how man y giggling girls in sleeping bags I’ll have to step over to get to the kitch en.”  The idea here is that the girls will be sleeping probably out in the main, o r in what we would call the “living room,” and since the kitchen is often next to that , if he wants to go to the kitchen he’ll have to step over these girls in the sleeping  bags to get there.

Irene says, “You’re not going to get anything out of me .”  To “get something out of someone” means to get information, especially secret i nformation from someone, to do something to make the other person tell  you something that they don’t want to tell you, or that you want to know that is a secret.  Irene says, “I can

 see right through you.”  The expression “to see right thr ough someone” means that you understand someone’s plans; you understand what a  person is trying to do, even though the person is trying to hide it from you  – is trying to keep it a secret.

Russ says, in response, “Are you going to wear your pajamas with feet?” “Pajamas” (pajamas) are clothes that you wear to bed, u sually there’s a shirt and there are pants.  For very young children, sometimes there  are pajamas that are one piece – that the whole thing is one piece of clothi ng, and that on the bottom there are little feet, like shoes, so that the young chil d doesn’t get cold.  Of course, Irene is older than that, and so she would not st ill be using something like that, so Russ is making a joke: are you going to wear your pajamas with feet, just like you did when you were a younger girl.  Irene says, “D on’t be stupid!  I haven’t worn those since I was six!”

Then Russ asks, “Can I be part of the pillow fight?”  A “pillow” is something that you put your head on when you sleep.  So, a “pillow fig ht” is when people hit each other with pillows.  It’s something that might hap pen at a slumber party or a sleepover.  Irene says, “No way!” meaning absolutely not, c ompletely impossible. “You’re not invited!” – you’re not invited to the part y.  Russ says, “But you’re going to stay up all night and watch movies, aren’t you?  I want to do that, too.” To “stay up all night” means to stay awake all night, n ever to go to sleep.  Once again, Russ is joking – is kidding with Irene, he doesn’t really want to do that.

Irene says, “You’d better stop teasing me or I’m going to tell Mom.”  To “tease” someone means to make jokes about someone, to laugh at so meone, or make other people laugh at someone.  It’s not considered a nice thing to do.  Russ says, “I’m not doing anything.  I’m only trying to help yo u plan your party.”  Of course, he isn’t!

Irene says, “Right!”  When we use the word “right” in t hat way, with that intonation – that sound, “oh, right!” – what you’re  really saying is that you don’t believe what the other person is saying.  Normally, “righ t” means that you agree with someone, or that someone is telling you something t hat is true.  But here, when used with that particular tone it is the opposite;  it means I don’t believe you. Irene then says, “You want to help me?  It’s more like yo u want to wreck my party.”  To “wreck” (wreck) here means to ruin or to dest roy.  “Wreck” has a couple of different meanings; once again, take a look at  the Learning Guide for this episode.

 Russ then says, once again joking, “Ah, you’ve hurt my feeli ngs.”  To “hurt someone’s feelings” means to make someone feel bad, to make someone feel sad about something.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Russ:  Mom says you’re having a slumber party next Saturday.

Irene:  I’m just having a few friends over for a sleepove r and it’s none of your business.

Russ:  Don’t be like that.  How many people did you invit e?

Irene:  I’m not telling you anything.  I know what you’ re thinking.  You want to pull pranks on us.

Russ:  No, I don’t.  I just want to know how many giggl ing girls in sleeping bags I’ll have to step over to get to the kitchen.

Irene:  You’re not going to get anything out of me.  I can see right through you.

Russ:  Are you going to wear your pajamas with feet?

Irene:  Don’t be stupid!  I haven’t worn those since I was six!

Russ:  Can I be part of the pillow fight?

Irene:  No way!  You’re not invited!

Russ:  But you’re going to stay up all night and watch mo vies, aren’t you?  I want to do that, too.

Irene:  You’d better stop teasing me or I’m going to tell Mom.

Russ:  I’m not doing anything.  I’m only trying to help you plan your party.

Irene:  Right!  You want to help me?  It’s more like you want to wreck my party.

Russ:  Ah, you’ve hurt my feelings.

 Irene:  I doubt it.  Now leave me alone!

# Planning for Retirement

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 44: Planning for Retirement.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 444.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Planning for Retirement.”  It’s a dialogue between Paulina and Carlos, and it uses some vocabulary that is common in t he United States when talking about paying for your retirement years.  Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paulina:  Did you get your social security statement?  I ju st got mine in the mail. If I keep working at this rate for the next 20 years, bet ween Social Security and my savings, I should be sitting pretty for retirement.

Carlos:  Yeah, I should be okay when I retire, too.  I’ ve been contributing to a 401(k) through my work for years, and my company gives a mat ching contribution.

Paulina:  Really?  I never bothered with a 401(k).

Carlos:  A 401(k) really adds up over time.  I also have a n IRA, which is tax- deferred, and I have my money in a portfolio that is sp lit between stocks and bonds.  All of these investments are for the long haul, of course.  How about you?  What’s your retirement plan?

Paulina:  I have money stashed away in a nice little nest  egg.

Carlos:  Where do you have your money invested?

Paulina:  It’s safe and sound, don’t you worry.

Carlos:  [Laughs] You make it sound like you have it stashe d under your mattress.

 Paulina:  A mattress is a very safe place for your money!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Paulina asking Carlos, “Did you  get your Social Security statement?”  “Social Security” is a U.S. governme nt program that allows you to get money after you stop working, when you retire .  You pay taxes every year when you work, and those taxes are given back to you w hen you stop working.  A Social Security statement is a piece of paper  the government sends you every year that tells you how much money you have spent, or rather, how much money you have paid the government – the government is the one that spends the money!  Paulina says, “I just got (or received) mine in the mail.  If I keep working at this rate for the next 20 years, between  Social Security and my savings, I should be sitting pretty for retirement.”  Pau lina says, “If I keep working at this rate (“at this rate” means at this pace, working the same number of hours each week) for the next 20 years.”  She says, “between Socia l Security and my savings.”  The word “between” normally means in the midd le of two things, but here the use is a little bit different.  It means toge ther, combined, both.  So she’s saying if I take both my Social Security money and my savings (the money that she put in a bank and saved) she should be sitting pretty f or retirement.  To be “sitting pretty” means to be in a good situation, a goo d position.  You don’t have any problems or worries, especially financially.  “Retirem ent” is the period of time after you stop working.  In the United States, it’s usual ly at age 62 or 65.

Carlos says, “Yeah (yes), I should be okay when I retire, t oo.  I’ve been contributing (I’ve been putting money in) to a 401(k).”   A “401(k)” is a special type of U.S. retirement account that the employer (the pers on who you work for, or the company you work for) gives money to the workers for their r etirement.  The workers also give money, or put money into the 401(k).  I n some companies, the worker is the only one that puts money into the 401(k), but in some companies – in most companies both the company and the employee (the person working at the company) “contribute,” or put money into this account,  and you invest that money.  You put it in stocks or other financial “instrumen ts,” as they’re called – other financial investments, and you hope you will have m ore money when you retire.  401(k)s are usually accounts that you don’t have to pay taxes on when you put the money in.  You have to pay taxes, typically, whe n you take the money out when you retire.

So, Carlos has a 401(k); he says, “my company gives me a match ing contribution.”  A “matching contribution” is what the co mpany gives or puts into your retirement account.  “Matching” means usually they put  in the same amount as you do.  “Contribution” just means what you give to som eone or something.

 Paulina says, “Really?  I never bothered with a 401(k).”   “I never bothered” means I have never done that, it seemed like too much tr ouble so I never did it.

Carlos says, “A 401(k) really adds up over time.”  To “add up,” here, means to accumulate, to get more and more, to total.  “Add up”  has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanation.  Here, it’s a two-word phrasal verb meanin g to accumulate, to grow. Carlos says, “I also have an IRA.”  “IRA” stands for (or m eans) individual retirement account.  This is another special account – ret irement account that you can have in the United States.  It is also one that you don’t have to pay taxes on when you put the money into your IRA account.  Carl os says that his IRA is tax-deferred.  To “defer” means to do something later , at a later time.  So, “tax- deferred” means you don’t pay taxes now, but you’ll pay it later.  You’ll pay the government taxes on the money when you take the money o ut after you retire.

Carlos says that he has his money in a portfolio that is spl it between stocks and bonds.  A “portfolio” is a word that describes all of you r investments, especially stocks and bonds.  “Stocks” are partial ownership that you ha ve in a company. They are sold in something called “shares.”  You buy share s in a company, that means you’re buying a certain small percentage of the comp any.  You own part of the company when you buy stock.  A “bond” (bond) is an a greement where the company or a government borrows money from you and agree s to pay you back with interest at a future date.  “Bond” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide, again, for some additional explanations.

Carlos says that his portfolio is split between stocks and bo nds.  “Split,” here, just means divided, when you have more than one part of som ething.  Carlos says that all of these investments are for the long haul, of  course.  The “long haul” (haul) means for the long-term, over the long period of time, not immediately.  If someone says, “We’re here for the long haul,” they mean  we are here for a long time, we’re not going to worry about what happens in the next year or two years; we are worried about or we are concerned about only w hat happens after many years.  Another word for “long haul” is “long run.”  The economist John Maynard Keynes once said, “In the long run, we’re all dead,” me aning if you worry too much about only what happens after many years, you may not be alive!

Carlos says that he has his investments, and they are for the  long haul.  Then he asks Paulina, “How about you?  What’s your retirement pl an?”  Paulina says, “I have my money stashed away in a nice little nest egg.”  T o “stash (stash) away” something means to hide something, to put it in a secre t place.  A “nest egg” is

 money that you are going to use, in this case, for reti rement.  Money that you save for your retirement when you stop working, that’s call ed a “nest (nest) egg.” Carlos says, “Where do you have your money invested?”  Where  did you put your money – stocks, bonds, etc.?  Paulina says, “It’s safe an d sound, don’t you worry.”  The expression “to be safe and sound” means to b e secure, without any danger, without any worry.  Whenever there’s a big fir e here in Los Angeles, or an earthquake, some members of my family – the ones who st ill love me! – will call me and ask if I am okay, and I will tell them I am “safe and sound,” I am fine.

Carlos laughs at Paulina and says, “You make it sound like  (you are giving me the impression that) you have your money stashed under your mattress.”  Your “mattress” is what you sleep on – what most of us sleep on at night.  Paulina says, “A mattress is a very safe place for your money!” suggestin g that she doesn’t have her money invested anywhere or in a bank, but  she has it in her house underneath her mattress.  Putting some money under neath (or below) your mattress is a traditional way of saving your money – of  keeping your money. But, of course, it’s not a very good investment, althoug h nowadays, perhaps, it is the safest one!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paulina:  Did you get your Social Security statement?  I just got mine in the mail. If I keep working at this rate for the next 20 years, bet ween Social Security and my savings, I should be sitting pretty for retirement.

Carlos:  Yeah, I should be okay when I retire, too.  I’ ve been contributing to a 401(k) through my work for years, and my company gives a mat ching contribution.

Paulina:  Really?  I never bothered with a 401(k).

Carlos:  A 401(k) really adds up over time.  I also have a n IRA, which is tax- deferred, and I have my money in a portfolio that is sp lit between stocks and bonds.  All of these investments are for the long haul, of course.  How about you?  What’s your retirement plan?

Paulina:  I have money stashed away in a nice little nest  egg.

Carlos:  Where do you have your money invested?

 Paulina:  It’s safe and sound, don’t you worry.

Carlos:  [Laughs] You make it sound like you have it stashe d under your mattress.

Paulina:  A mattress is a very safe place for your money!

# Problems with Drugs and Medical Devices

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 45: Problems with Drugs and Medical Devices.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 445.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  Download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page guide that contains all of the vocabulary,  definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, compreh ension questions, and, best of all, a complete transcript of everything we say on  this episode.

This episode is called “Problems with Drugs and Medical De vices.”  It’s a conversation between Suzanne and Abdul using a lot of voca bulary that we might find in a hospital or in a medical situation.  L et’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Suzanne:  Don’t take that!  I’m reading an article in the newspaper about all of the drugs and medical devices that have been recalled in t he past year and you wouldn’t believe how long this list is.

Abdul:  I’m just taking something for my headache.  I’m sure this medicine is fine.

Suzanne:  Don’t be so sure.  I’m just reading about thi s drug that was contaminated and before it was recalled, it caused 13 de aths.

Abdul:  Contaminated drugs are one in a million.  No w can I take my medicine?

Suzanne:  Listen to this.  Over 400 people had terrible  side effects before this drug was recalled, and a drug recalled six months ago cau ses birth defects. Here’s a medical device for people with heart problems t hat’s defective and eight people died as a result.

Abdul:  Okay, I’ve heard enough.

Suzanne:  No, wait, there’s more.  You’ve got to see th is list of alerts that the government issued warning people against over-the-counte r drugs like the one you’re about to take.  You’d better check to see if it’s o n this list.

 Abdul:  Don’t be ridiculous.  I’ve been taking this for months.  If there were something wrong with it, don’t you think the pharmaceu tical company would have taken out full-page ads in the papers?

Suzanne:  I doubt it.  Do you think they want to encoura ge litigation?

Abdul:  Here, you check it against that list.  If you fin d it on there, you can say you’ve saved my life!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Suzanne telling Abdul, “Don’ t take that!”  What she is talking about here is a pill that Abdul is about to swa llow.  We usually talk about drugs using the verb “to take” – “to take drugs,” “to ta ke your drugs.”  This means to, usually, to swallow a pill.  Suzanne says to Abdul, “D on’t take that!  I’m reading an article in the newspaper about all of the drugs and medical devices that have been recalled in the past year.”  “Drugs,” as yo u probably know, is just another word for medicine, usually chemical substances th at you swallow to make you feel better, although drugs can also refer to things that you get, for example, in a shot, when the doctor takes a needle and p uts it into your arm or other parts of your body.  “Medical devices” is a general t erm referring to a piece of electronics or other equipment that helps you do bet ter in terms of your health. For example, if you have a bad heart, you may have a “p acemaker,” which is a small electronic device they put into your body to help you r heart.  That’s a medical device.  To “recall,” in this case, means for a co mpany to say that there is some problem with their drug, or some problem with their medical device, or whatever they sell, and you need to bring it back to wher e you bought it and get a new one or get your money back.  These so-called “recall s” are not too common, but it does happen when a company makes something that they discover later is not safe.  They will do a recall – they will recall the  item.  “Recall” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Well, Suzanne is worried about the drugs and medical de vices that have been recalled in the past year; she says, “you won’t believe ho w long this list is.”  The expression “you won’t believe” is often used when you are t elling someone something that you think is surprising.  Abdul, however, sa ys, “I’m just taking something for my headache.  I’m sure this medicine is fine .”  “Medicine,” again, is another word for drugs.  Suzanne says, “Don’t be so sure,”  meaning maybe you are wrong.  “I’m just reading about this drug that wa s contaminated and before it was recalled, it caused 13 deaths.”  To be “contaminated ” means that there is

 something dirty, something impure, or perhaps even poison ous in a food or a drug.  If a drug is contaminated it could hurt you, eve n kill you.

Abdul says, “Contaminated drugs are one in a million.”  The expression “one in a million” means very unusual, very rare, uncommon.  Abdul s ays, “Now can I take my medicine?”  Suzanne says, “Listen to this.  Over 400 peop le had terrible side effects before this drug was recalled.”  A “side effect” (two words) is an unintended consequence of something, that is to say, somet hing that happens that you didn’t mean to happen, especially when we are talking about drugs and medicine.  So for example, some drugs, when you take them , you become sleepy – you want to sleep.  Even though the drug isn’t d esigned to make you sleep, that is one of the side effects – one of the thin gs that happens in addition to what the drug is supposed to do.  Suzanne says, “a dru g recalled six months ago causes birth defects.”  “Birth” is when you are born,  when a little baby comes out of his or her mother.  A “defect” is something that  is wrong, something that is not right with a person or a thing.  Usually defects are  things that we refer to when we are talking about objects: “The chair has a def ect in it, one of the legs is too short.”  But, a “birth defect” is something that a baby is born with, some sort of health problem.  Suzanne says, “Here’s a medical device for people with heart problems that’s defective and eight people died as a res ult,” or because of the device.  “Defective” comes from the word “defect,” it mean s with a problem, not working correctly.

Abdul says, “Okay, I’ve heard enough,” meaning stop tellin g me this.  Suzanne, of course, says, “No, wait, there’s more (there’s more inf ormation I have to tell you).  You’ve got to see this list of alerts that the go vernment issued warning people against over-the-counter drugs.”  An “alert” (al ert) is a warning, a notification, an important message usually about a probl em.  A “warning” is similar to an alert; the verb is “to warn,” meaning to  tell someone about something bad or dangerous that might happen.  The exp ression “over-the- counter” refers to drugs that are sold in a store witho ut permission from a doctor, without what we would call a “prescription,” which is w hen the doctor has to give you specific permission to take a drug.  Some drugs, like for example aspirin, do not require a prescription; they are over-the-counter drugs.  The United States has a lot of over-the-counter drugs, and every country is different in terms of the number of over-the-counter drugs you might find.  One doctor from a European country told me that the U.S. has a lot more over-the-co unter drugs than other countries, but each country is different.

Suzanne says to Abdul, “You’d better check to see if it’s on  the list.”  Abdul says, “Don’t be ridiculous.  I’ve been taking this for months.  If there were something wrong with it, don’t you think the pharmaceutical compan y would have taken out

 full-page ads in the papers?”  A “pharmaceutical company ” is a company that makes drugs – that makes medicine.  Abdul is saying that i f there was a problem with the drug he is taking for his headache, the company  that makes the drug would have told people by, for example, taking out an a dvertisement in the newspaper.  Suzanne says, “I doubt it.  Do you think they want to encourage litigation?”  “Litigation” is legal action, a lawsuit.   When someone does something wrong to you and you try to get money from them, that  would be an example of litigation, something involving the courts and a judge .

Abdul says, “Here, you check it against that list.”  He’s aski ng Suzanne to look and see if the drug he is going to take is on the list.   To “check something against something” means to look for something on a list, to see  if it is on the list.  Abdul says, “If you find it there, you can say you’ve saved my life !”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Suzanne:  Don’t take that!  I’m reading an article in the newspaper about all of the drugs and medical devices that have been recalled in t he past year and you wouldn’t believe how long this list is.

Abdul:  I’m just taking something for my headache.  I’m sure this medicine is fine.

# Going to a Home Improvement Store

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 46: Going to a Home Improvement Store.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 446.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can download a L earning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page PDF guide that will help yo u improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Going to a Home Improvement Stor e.”  It’s a place where you buy things to fix your home.  The dialogue is between  Paige and Vern, they’re going to talk about something things would typica lly find in a store like this to fix up or to repair your home.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paige:  I think we can get everything we need to fix up  the house in one trip. What do you think?

Vern:  We can try.  It seems like everybody had the same th ought when they woke up this morning: Go to the home improvement store !

Paige:  Yeah, it’s a little crowded, but I still thin k we can get all we need today.

Vern:  To do that, I think we need to split up.  Let ’s look at our list and divvy it up.

Paige:  Okay, we need to get some wiring to install the  new lights.  I’ll go to the electrical department for that.

Vern:  All right.  We need lumber for the new fence,  so I’ll go to the building materials department.

Paige:  What about the pipes and fixtures we need for the bathroom?  Can you go to the plumbing department for those, while I go to the hardware department for the tools?

Vern:  Okay, I can do that, but aren’t you feeling tir ed already?  I know I am.

 Paige:  Come on.  How are we supposed to be weekend wa rriors if we can’t even do some simple shopping?  We’ll meet in the garden dep artment afterwards, okay?

Vern:  Whatever you say.

Paige:  Ready, set, go!

[end of dialogue]

Paige begins the dialogue by saying, “I think we can get everything we need to fix up the house in one trip.”  To “fix up” is a two-wo rd phrasal verb meaning to improve something, to make something better, or, if it is broken, to fix (or repair) something.  “Fix up” has a couple of different meanings in English; go to the Learning Guide for today to find out more about what  this verb means.  Paige says, “we can fix up the house in one trip,” meaning one time going to the store; we don’t need to go back again and again.  Paige says, “ What do you think?”

Vern says, “We can try.  It seems like everybody had the same thought when they woke up this morning,” meaning everybody else is also g oing to the store. “Go to the home improvement store!”  Vern says.  Home im provement stores are popular in the United States.  There are two very lar ge companies that have stores where you can buy things to fix (or repair) your ho me.

Paige says, “Yeah, it is a little crowded (meaning there  are a lot of people here), but I still think we can get all we need today.”  Ver n says, “To do that (in order to do that), I think we need to split up.”  To “split up ” is another two-word phrasal verb meaning for two people to go in different direct ions, to different places.  If there are two of you in the store and you say, “let’s spli t up,” you mean you go and buy some things; I’ll go and buy other things.  To “ split up” can also mean to end a romantic relationship: “My girlfriend and I spli t up.”  It was probably a good idea, since I’m married!

Vern says, “Let’s look at our list and divvy it up.”  To “di vvy (divvy) something up” means to divide something between two or more people, to give part of something to each person in the group.  If you have a cake and you decide to divvy it up, you’re going to give everyone a piece of the ca ke that’s present (that is there).

Paige says, “Okay, we need to get some wiring to install t he new lights.” “Wiring,” in this case, refers to long, thin pieces of me tal that are usually covered in plastic, and they’re used to move electricity or other e lectronic energy from one

 point to another.  We sometimes call them “cables,” dep ending on how they’re used.  Paige says, “we need some wiring to install the ne w lights.”  To “install” something means to put a piece of equipment into a hom e or another building, usually connecting it to electricity but not always.  Someon e may say, “I am going to install new lights in this room,” they mean I am go ing to put in new lights and I will connect them up so that they work.  Paige says, “I’ll go to the electrical department for that.”  The “electrical department” is the part of the store that sells cables (wiring, that is), other things that are used f or putting electricity in your house or building.

Vern says, “All right (okay).  We need lumber for the n ew fence.”  “Lumber” (lumber) are pieces of wood that have been cut usually i n standard (or very common) sizes that you use for building things.  So, if yo u are going to put up a fence between you and your neighbor, you would buy some “ lumber,” long pieces of wood that you would use to build your fence.  Vern says, “I’ll go to the building materials department.”  The “building mater ials department” is the part of a home improvement store that sells things like wood, o r things to put on your roof, or the floor; things that you would use to build  things, especially houses or other buildings.

Paige says, “What about the pipes and fixtures we need for the bathroom?”  A “pipe” (pipe) is a long, round, piece of plastic or met al that’s usually used to carry water from one part of the house to another.  A “fixt ure” is something – anything that you attach to the wall of a home or to the ceilin g of the home.  It’s something that you would leave when you sell the house; it’s perma nently attached, that is, to the wall or to the ceiling of your house.  Paige says,  “Can you go to the plumbing department for those, while I go to the har dware department for the tools?”  The “plumbing department” is the part of the  home improvement store that sells things related to how water is used in your h ome.  So, toilets and showers and pipes; all of these would be sold in the pl umbing department.  The “hardware department” is the part of the store that se lls tools and things you need to make things.  Hammers, nails, screws; these are al l things found in a hardware department.  “Tools” are things you use usuall y to do something else, and they’re usually some things that are held in your han d.  It’s a general term referring to things like hammers, saws, screwdrivers; all of these are tools.  “Tool” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a lo ok at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Vern says, “Okay, I can do that, but aren’t you feeling t ired already?  I know I am.”  Vern is already feeling tired.  Paige says, “Come  on (meaning let’s go). How are we supposed to be weekend warriors if we can’t e ven do some simple shopping?”  A “weekend warrior” is someone who works a lo t on their house on

 the weekend; it can also refer to someone who does a lo t of exercise or plays sports on the weekend.  But here, it refers to someone  who works on their house every weekend in order to make it better.  Paige says, “W e’ll meet in the garden department afterwards (after we are finished shopping ).”  The “garden department” is the part of the store that sells plants a nd other things for improving your garden outside of your house.

Vern says, “Whatever you say.”  This is a phrase that says tha t you will agree to whatever the other person is proposing – whatever they a re suggesting.  It doesn’t mean that you think it will be successful.  Sometim es this is a phrase used when someone says something that isn’t necessarily correct .  You may just say, “Oh, well, whatever,” meaning if you say so; that mea ns I don’t necessarily believe you.  But here, Vern uses the expression to mean  I’ll do whatever you tell me to even though I’m not 100 percent convinced.

Paige says, “Ready, set, go!”  These three words, “ready, set, go,” are used to start a race.  You’re telling all of the participants, for example, who may be running in a race to get ready, and then when you say t he word “go,” they start the race.  Paige is making a little joke here about wha t they are going to do now when they shop.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paige:  I think we can get everything we need to fix up  the house in one trip. What do you think?

Vern:  We can try.  It seems like everybody had the same th ought when they woke up this morning: Go to the home improvement store !

Paige:  Yeah, it’s a little crowded, but I still thin k we can get all we need today.

Vern:  To do that, I think we need to split up.  Let ’s look at our list and divvy it up.

Paige:  Okay, we need to get some wiring to install the  new lights.  I’ll go to the electrical department for that.

Vern:  All right.  We need lumber for the new fence,  so I’ll go to the building materials department.

 Paige:  What about the pipes and fixtures we need for the bathroom?  Can you go to the plumbing department for those, while I go to the hardware department for the tools?

Vern:  Okay, I can do that, but aren’t you feeling tir ed already?  I know I am.

Paige:  Come on.  How are we supposed to be weekend wa rriors if we can’t even do some simple shopping?  We’ll meet in the garden dep artment afterwards, okay?

Vern:  Whatever you say.

Paige:  Ready, set, go!

# Heating and Cooling a Home

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 47: Heating and Cooling a Home.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 447.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  On it, you can download a Lea rning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faster.  Yo u can also take a look at our ESL Podcast Store, which has some additional cours es in business and daily English we think you’ll be interested in.

This podcast is a dialogue between Carla and Trent.  T hey’re going to be using some common vocabulary to talk about “heating,” making your house warmer, or “cooling,” making your house cooler.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carla:  It’s freezing in here!  Why is the air condition er on?

Trent:  I just finished exercising and I’m sweating like a pig.

Carla:  That’s no reason to turn the A/C on full blast !  I’m cold.  I’m turning on the heat for a little while.

Trent:  Are you crazy?  It’s 70 degrees outside!

Carla:  I’m no crazier than you are.  How come you can t urn on the A/C and I can’t turn on the heat?

Trent:  I only turned on the A/C because it’s so humid outside, and it was taking a long time for me to cool down.  If you’re cold, just op en the windows and doors, and we’ll get some ventilation in here.  It’ll heat u p again pretty quickly.

Carla:  What should I do in the meantime?  Put on my winter coat or crawl under the covers?

Trent:  Go sit outside.  I’ll get myself a glass of iced t ea and I’ll get you a cup of hot tea.  How does that sound?

 Carla:  Leave it to you to come up with the best idea of the day!

[end of dialogue]

Carla begins the dialogue by saying, “It’s freezing in h ere!”  “Freezing,” in this case, means very cold, extremely cold.  It doesn’t necessarily me an that the temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit or zero deg rees Celsius; it just means it’s very cold in here.  Carla asks, “Why is the air co nditioner on?”  The “air conditioner,” sometimes called simply the “A/C,” is a  machine that makes the air colder in a room.  It’s something you would use duri ng the warm season, in the summer in the northern hemisphere.

Trent says, “I just finished exercising and I’m sweating li ke a pig.”  This is an expression: “to sweat (sweat) like a pig.”  To “sweat” mea ns that you have water that is coming out of small holes in your skin, what we cal l “pores” (pores), and if you are exercising or working very hard you may sweat.  Anoth er verb for this is “to perspire.”  That sounds a little better; sweat is a little more informal.

Trent says he’s sweating like a pig.  Carla says, “That’s no reason to turn the A/C on full blast!”  “That’s no reason to (do something)” is a phrase we use to show that what the other person is doing is unnecessary or sill y, perhaps even illogical. “That’s no reason to turn the A/C on.”  To “turn somet hing on” means to start the machine running; in this case, the machine is an air condi tioner – the A/C.  The expression “full blast” (blast) means at the highest or m ost powerful setting, at full power.  So, Trent has turned the air conditioning ont o the coolest possible temperature and the highest possible fan setting.  The “fan” is the part of machine that blows the air out of the machine.

Carla says, “I’m cold.  I’m turning on the heat for a l ittle while.”  The “heat,” in this case, would simply mean the “heater,” a machine that war ms your house.  Trent says, “Are you crazy?  It’s 70 degrees outside!”  A “degree” is a measurement of heat.  In the United States we use Fahrenheit; in mo st other countries the degrees are measured in Celsius – we’re a little slow he re in the United States!

Carla says, “I’m no crazier than you are,” meaning you are as crazy as I am. “How come (or why) you can turn on the A/C and I can’t  turn on the heat?”  Trent says, “I only turned on the A/C because it’s so humid outsi de.”  “Humid” (humid) means there’s a lot of water in the air – a lot of wa ter vapor in the air.  Trent says, “it was taking a long time for me to cool down.”  To “ cool down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to help your body become less hot; to  help your body, in this case, relax after exercising.  That’s also called coolin g down.  If you exercise very hard you need to cool down – your body needs to cool  down.  To “cool

 down” has a couple of different meanings in English; ta ke a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Trent says, “If you’re cold, just open the windows and d oors, and we’ll get some ventilation in here.”  “Ventilation” is the movement of air within a room, going in and out of a room.  Trent is suggesting Carla open the  windows so they can get more movement of the air, which would heat the room u p a little bit.  Trent says, “It’ll heat up again pretty quickly.”  To “heat up” me ans to increase the temperature of something, to make something hotter, i n this case, the air in the room.  Notice that word “up” is used a lot with verbs in  English to mean many different things.  Unfortunately, there isn’t one hin t – one thing I can tell you about what “up” means with the verb because it means something with each verb, typically.

Carla says, “What should I do in the meantime?”  The exp ression “in the meantime” means before something else happens, while yo u’re waiting for something else to happen.  So for example, if your wife  or husband says to you, “Dinner will be prepared (will be done) in 10 minut es.  In the meantime, please set the table” – please put things on the table for u s so that we can eat: dishes, cups, that sort of thing.  In the meantime is that tim e before something else happens.

Well, Carla says, “What should I do in the meantime?” b ecause, of course, she’s cold.  She says, “Put on my winter coat or crawl under the covers?”  She’s saying, well, should I put on my winter jacket – my winter  coat – to keep me warm, or should I crawl under the covers.  To “crawl” (cra wl) in this case means to go underneath the covers.  The “covers” are sheets, bla nkets, what we call “comforters,” large blankets that keep you warm when you are sleeping on your bed.  So to “crawl under” means to get underneath, be low so that they are covering your body.  That’s why they’re called covers.  “Cover”  has several different meanings in English, however, so take a look at that Learning Guide. You know what you’ll find there!  To “crawl” also can m ean to get down on your hands and knees and slowly move your body forward.  A littl e baby usually starts crawling, and then they start walking.  So they go from  being on hands and knees to just being on their two legs.

Trent says, “Go sit outside.  I’ll get myself a glass of ice d tea and I’ll get you a cup of hot tea.  How does that sound?”  Carla says, “Leav e it to you to come up with the best idea of the day!”  The expression “leave it to you (to do something)” is a phrase we used to show that the other person has som e special gift or talent for doing something, or is very good at doing something.   Although, it isn’t necessarily always a compliment – it isn’t always a nice thin g to say.  Someone

 may say you, “Oh, leave it to you to get into an accident. ”  That means you have some sort of special talent for doing that, even though it’s not a good thing.  But here, Carla is saying that Trent has come up with a good  idea, the best idea of the day.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Carla:  It’s freezing in here!  Why is the air condition er on?

Trent:  I just finished exercising and I’m sweating like a pig.

Carla:  That’s no reason to turn the A/C on full blast !  I’m cold.  I’m turning on the heat for a little while.

Trent:  Are you crazy?  It’s 70 degrees outside!

Carla:  I’m no crazier than you are.  How come you can t urn on the A/C and I can’t turn on the heat?

# Making Business Contacts

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 48 – Making Business Contacts.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 448.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page guide we have for all of ou r current episodes that contains the vocabulary, definitions, new sample sentences u sing the vocabulary, additional explanations, cultural notes, and a  complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Making Business Contacts.”  It is a di alogue between Phan and Montel, and they’re going to use a lot of vo cabulary that would be used in the business world when you are talking about people that you want to work with or do work with.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Phan:  Hi, Montel.  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

Montel:  It’s my pleasure.

Phan:  Since I’m new here, I was hoping you might be w illing to give me some pointers on how to get new clients.  To be honest, I’ve never been on this side of the fence before and I’m a little out of my comfort zon e.

Montel:  Oh, sure, I’m glad to give you as much help as I can.  Getting clients is a bit of an art, but the key is building relationships.

Phan:  What do you mean?

Montel:  Most of my clients come to me through networking .  I get referrals from people who know me and know my track record.

Phan:  Really?  I was thinking that I needed to send ou t some direct mail or do some cold calling.

 Montel:  You may need to do that to start, but if I w ere you, I’d also spend time making connections in the business community.  Go where you t hink business prospects may be.  To woo new clients, you need to meet th em first.

Phan:  How do I find out where they’ll be?

Montel:  Again, you make contacts.  You’ve made the first step today by getting in touch with me.  I’m going to a reception tonight a nd it will be a who’s who of the business community.  Do you want to go?

Phan:  Really?  You’d let me tag along?

Montel:  Sure, but there’s a quid pro quo.  In the f uture, if you get invited to something like this, you invite me to go along.

Phan:  That’s more than fair.  I think I just got my fi rst lesson in making business connections.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Phan saying to Montel, “Hi, M ontel.  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.”  Montel says, “It’s my pleasu re,” which is something that you say when someone thanks you for doing something.  You can say, “you’re welcome,” but here, because both people probabl y want to meet, Montel says, “It’s my pleasure.”

Phan says, “Since I’m new here, I was hoping you might be  willing to give me some pointers on how to get new clients (or customers).”   A “pointer,” in this case, means an idea or a suggestion for a way to do someth ing.  We might also call it a “tip.”  “Can you give me some pointers on how  to work the television (how to operate the television set)?  I don’t understand th ese buttons.”  Phan says, “To be honest, I’ve never been on this side of the fence befo re and I’m a little out of my comfort zone.”  “This side of the fence” means in a cert ain position or a situation.  “That side of the fence” would be in anoth er or opposing situation.  So perhaps Phan was not working in this part of the company,  and is now having to do something she didn’t have to do before.  She says she’ s a little out of her comfort zone.  “To be out of your comfort zone” means th at you are in a situation that you are uncomfortable with or are unfamiliar wi th, usually because it’s new to you.

Montel says, “Oh, sure (meaning yes), I’m glad to give you  as much help as I can.  Getting clients is a bit of an art.”  To say somethi ng is “a bit (bit) of

 something” means it’s a little bit of this thing.  In t his case, it’s a little bit or somewhat of “an art,” meaning you have to know how to d o it; it’s not a science – it’s not scientific, it doesn’t follow certain rules.  Yo u have to be creative in order to do it.  Montel says, “the key is building relationship s.”

Phan says, “What do you mean?”  Montel replies, “Most of my clients come to me through networking.”  To “network” means to meet and talk to other people, usually in your area of business (your profession).  You giv e each other your telephone number, email address, address perhaps, what w e would call your “contact information,” and these are people you can call later and perhaps get business from.  So, Montel is recommending that Phan do some networking. Montel says, “I get referrals from people who know me an d know my track record.”  A “referral” is a recommendation of one perso n to another.  It’s someone saying that this person is good for what you want .  For example, if I am going to paint my house – and I really should paint my h ouse – I would, perhaps, ask my neighbor who had his house painted last month what  painter or which painting company he used.  I would get a referral from  him; he would recommend someone to me.  “Track record” means your past success, or perh aps failure.  If you have a good track record, that means that you’ve had ma ny successes; you’ve been very successful.  If you have a poor track record,  that means that you haven’t been very successful.  Here, Montel means his good  track record.

Phan says, “Really?  I was thinking that I needed to send out some direct mail or do some cold calling.”  “Direct mail” and “cold callin g” are two ways that salespeople try to get new customers.  “Direct mail” is wh en you send a letter or a brochure, some sort of information to people, and usu ally you get their names from a list of people who are in your profession or in your kind of business.  This is mail that goes to their office, sometimes even to the ir home, and you are trying to get people to respond to you.  It’s a type of adverti sement.  “Cold calling” is to call someone up on the telephone who isn’t expecting your  call, usually someone you have never talked to before.  So you call them and yo u try to get their business.  To do something “cold” means to do it without any preparation.  In this case, it means that you don’t know the person before yo u call them and they’re not expecting you to call.  It can be very difficult because most people don’t want to talk to a salesperson, so you have to be very “persistent ,” meaning you have to continue calling and calling as many people as possible for it to be successful.

Montel says that “You may need to do that (that is, dire ct mail and cold calling) to start (at the beginning), but if I were you, I’d also spend time making connections in the business community.”  A “connection,” here, means a  relationship, getting to know someone else, usually in a business or professional  situation.  Montel says, “Go where you think business prospects may be.”  A “prosp ect” is a person

 who might be interested in doing business with you, someo ne who we would call a “potential” client or customer; one of your future cust omers, you hope.  Montel says, “To woo (woo) new clients, you need to meet them fi rst.”  To “woo” someone means to try to get someone to do something for you by being very nice to that person, by understanding who that person is and what they want. So, a young man might woo a beautiful young girl: try to get her to go on a date with him.

Phan says, “How do I find out where they’ll be?” meanin g how do I know where my prospects will be.  By the way, “prospect” has a couple of  different meanings in English; just take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Montel answers Phan’s question by saying, “ Again, you make contacts.”  A “contact” is someone that you know in a business  or a professional way.  Montel says, “You’ve made the first step today by ge tting in touch with me.” To “get in touch with someone” means to contact someone,  to call them or to email them.  Montel says, “I’m going to a reception ton ight and it will be a who’s who of the business community.  Do you want to go?”  A “ reception” is a small party where people get together to drink, to eat; it’ s often something that is done before or after another large event, a speech or a con ference for example.

Montel is asking Phan if she wants to go with him to thi s reception, because it will be a who’s who of the business community.  The expression “ who’s who” (who’s who) is the group of people who are most important or  most active in a particular area.  So if you go to a podcasting conference or conven tion, you would find the who’s who of the podcasting world there, the most impo rtant people.

Phan says, “Really?  You’d let me tag along?”  To “tag along” means to go to an event with someone, not necessarily because you were invited.   So, if your brother is going out on a date and you say, “Can I tag  along?” he’ll probably say no.  To “tag along” means to go with someone even thou gh you weren’t invited yourself.

Montel says, “Sure, but there’s a quid pro quo.”  “Quid  (quid) pro quo (quo)” is a Latin expression meaning I will do something for you if you do something for me. It’s an exchange of favors, if you will; something you do f or something that someone else does for you.  Montel says, “In the future, if you get invited to something like this (a reception), you invite me to go a long” – so, I will let you come to my reception, but in the future, you have to let  me go to one of your receptions.  Phan says, “That’s more than fair (meaning t hat’s very reasonable). I think I just got my first lesson in making business connectio ns.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Phan:  Hi, Montel.  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

Montel:  It’s my pleasure.

Phan:  Since I’m new here, I was hoping you might be w illing to give me some pointers on how to get new clients.  To be honest, I’ve never been on this side of the fence before and I’m a little out of my comfort zon e.

Montel:  Oh, sure, I’m glad to give you as much help as I can.  Getting clients is a bit of an art, but the key is building relationships.

Phan:  What do you mean?

Montel:  Most of my clients come to me through networking .  I get referrals from people who know me and know my track record.

Montel:  You may need to do that to start, but if I w ere you, I’d also spend time making connections in the business community.  Go where you t hink business prospects may be.  To woo new clients, you need to meet th em first.

# Using an Instruction Manual

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 49 – Using an Instruction Manual.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 449.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension che cks, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Using an Instruction Manual.”  It’ s going to talk about some common vocabulary in using common machines and electr onics that you would find in your average home.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Aretha:  Oh, here’s the instruction manual.  I’ll read  you the section on “getting started.”

Carl:  No, you don’t need to do that.  I know how to do the installation.

Aretha:  But don’t you want to hear about the differ ent functions and specifications?

Carl:  There’ll be time for that after everything is h ooked up and we program the machine.

Aretha:  Okay, but the manual says that you shouldn’t plu g in the power supply until you’re done with the installation.

Carl:  I won’t.  Hmm…where is the port for this cord?

Aretha:  Do you want me to look it up in the manual?  There’s a troubleshooting section.

Carl:  No, I can figure it out myself.

 Aretha:  Look at this.  It’s a diagram of the controls a nd this section has illustrations on how to use the different modes.  Do yo u want me to read it to you while you’re hooking it up?

Carl:  No.  Now give me that manual.  I work alone.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Aretha saying, “Oh, here’s the  instruction manual,” the small book that comes with many machines that gives you “instr uctions,” tells you how to use the machine.  Aretha says, “I’ll read the sect ion (or the part) on ‘getting started.’”  Carl says, “No, you don’t need to d o that.  I know how to do the installation.”  “Installation” is when you have to take t he machine and connect it perhaps to another machine or do something with it so t hat it will be ready for you to use.  Some people like to try to do things by themselve s, without the instruction manual; other people like to read the manu al first before trying to connect the machine, or use the machine.  I am one of th ose that likes to read the manual completely before I use something; my wife is the opposite, she likes to just start using it and figure it out on her own.

Aretha says to Carl, “But don’t you want to hear about the different functions and specifications?”  A “function” is something that a machine or a program on a computer does; it’s what it does.  For example, the fun ction of a camera is to take pictures.  Cameras can have special functions for taking p ictures when there isn’t a lot of light in the picture.  “Specifications” refer  to detailed information about a product, usually measurements of some sort: how tall it is,  how wide it is, how much power it uses, and so forth.  Specifications for a co mputer would tell you how much memory it has, how fast the processor is, how big  the screen is if it has a screen, and so forth.

Carl says, “There’ll be time for that after everything is hooked up.”  He’s saying that he can look at the instruction book after he has the  machine hooked up.  To “hook up” a machine is a two-word phrasal verb meaning t o connect it, to plug the cables or other connections that it requires.  Usually you need to give it power so you need to connect it to some sort of power so urce, plugging it into the wall, for example, to get electricity.  There are othe r parts of hooking things up.  If you are hooking up a computer, you may connect it to a pri nter or to a monitor (a screen that you can look at).  The verb “to hook up” has se veral different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

 Carl says that they can program the machine.  To “program ” means, specifically for a piece of electronics, to provide instructions to the  machine about how you want it to operate.  For example, if you buy a video re corder you may have to program the time for your local time so that it will r ecord television programs when you want it to.

Carl says that there’ll be time for looking at the manu al after everything is hooked up and we program the machine.  Aretha says, “Okay, but  the manual says that you shouldn’t plug in the power supply until you’re done  with the installation.”  To “plug in” is a two-word phrasal verb, usually referrin g to providing electricity for an electronic machine or device.  So, in most places – houses a nd buildings – there are what we call electrical “outlets” (outlets), and th ose are places where you can plug in a machine.  The actual outlet is different in different countries.  Europe, for example, uses a different kind of electrical outlet t han the United States.  It also uses, in many countries, a different power setting.  So if you try to plug in your machines, say an electronic toothbrush, into a wall i n Europe you might ruin your machine because the electricity is different – the ki nd of electricity that is provided.  This is what I did once when I visited another  country and I ruined my electric toothbrush, so I speak from experience!

The “power supply” is a source of electricity for a piece of  electronics – an electrical machine.  Often, computers will have special “ transformers,” an electrical device that makes sure that the machine is getti ng the exact correct amount of power.  Notice that Aretha is reading the i nstructions and, of course, Carl isn’t interested.  He says, “I won’t,” meaning I wo n’t plug in the power supply until he’s finished with the installation.  Carl then says, “where is the port for this cord?”  A “port” (port) here refers to a small hole wh ere you put a certain cord, cable, or wire into.  It’s the place where you connect a  cable to a machine.  “Port” has a couple of different meanings in English however, so  take a look at the Learning Guide for a complete definition of this wor d.  A “cord” is just another name for a “cable,” a long wire that connects two thi ngs together.  Usually, when we are talking about the power supply, we refer to tha t as the “cord.”  When you plug something into the wall to an outlet, that’s usua lly called the “electrical cord.” The wires that connect different parts of the computer , or your computer to your printer for example, that would be called a “cable.”

Aretha asks Carl, “Do you want me to look it up in the m anual?  There’s a troubleshooting section.”  “Troubleshooting” refers to  giving people help, solving their problems, usually technical problems that they have w ith a machine or a computer program.  Carl says, “No, I can figure it out myself” – I can get the answer by myself; I don’t need the manual.

 Aretha says, “Look at this.  It’s a diagram of the control s and this section has illustrations on how to use the different modes.”  Are tha is showing Carl the instruction manual, and in the manual there is a diagr am.  A “diagram” is a drawing, usually that shows you where things are or whe re things are supposed to go, which cable goes to which port, for example.  T he section in the instruction manual also has illustrations.  “Illustrations,” again, a re a kind of drawing that gives you specific information, a picture of what it is tha t you should be doing with your machine.  A diagram is more like a set of lines tha t show where things are connected.  An illustration is usually something more thre e dimensional, a picture of something.  It is, however, usually a drawing; it’s no t an actual photograph.

Aretha says there are illustrations on how to use the dif ferent modes (modes).  A “mode” is one way that you can use a piece of machinery – a piece of electronic machinery.  Aretha asks, “Do you want me to read it to yo u while you’re hooking it up?”  Carl, of course, doesn’t; he says, “No.  Give me that manual.  I work alone” – I don’t work with other people.  I’m this wa y, as are many people; I find it difficult to work on something such as a computer or a ma chine with someone else trying to help me – I work alone.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Aretha:  Oh, here’s the instruction manual.  I’ll read  you the section on “getting started.”

Carl:  No, you don’t need to do that.  I know how to do the installation.

Aretha:  But don’t you want to hear about the differ ent functions and specifications?

Carl:  There’ll be time for that after everything is h ooked up and we program the machine.

Aretha:  Okay, but the manual says that you shouldn’t plu g in the power supply until you’re done with the installation.

Carl:  I won’t.  Hmm…where is the port for this cord?

Aretha:  Do you want me to look it up in the manual?  There’s a troubleshooting section.

 Carl:  No, I can figure it out myself.

Aretha:  Look at this.  It’s a diagram of the controls a nd this section has illustrations on how to use the different modes.  Do yo u want me to read it to you while you’re hooking it up?

Carl:  No.  Now give me that manual.  I work alone.

# Getting a Bad Reputation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 50: Getting a Bad Reputation.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 450.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains information to help you improve y our English even faster.

This episode is called “Getting a Bad Reputation.”  It’ s a dialogue between Lance and Paulina talking about a woman and her “reputatio n,” or what other people think of her.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lance:  Did you see Kim at the party last Saturday?

Paulina:  Yeah, I saw her.  Why?

Lance:  She was wearing a skimpy dress and all of the men were leering at her all night.  I used to think she was a nice girl.  Isn’t  she worried that she’ll get a reputation?

Paulina:  A reputation for what?

Lance:  For being…you know.

Paulina:  No, I don’t know.

Lance:  For being easy!  It doesn’t take much for people  to jump to the wrong conclusions when a woman is dressed like that.

Paulina:  So based on one dress she wore to a party, yo u’re ready to consider her promiscuous.

Lance:  No, not just based on that.  The guys at the par ty were talking and one of them said he used to date her, and he said…

 Paulina:  Now you’re listening to some sleazy guy at a par ty boasting about his conquest.  The question is, why are you so ready to give cre dibility to rumors like that?

Lance:  Whoa, don’t go ballistic on me.  I was only tell ing you what I heard.  I thought you might be interested.

Paulina:  Well, you thought wrong.  I used to think th at women were catty, but you men are much, much worse!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Lance saying to Paulina, “Did  you see Kim at the party last Saturday?”  Paulina said, “Yeah, I saw her.  Why?”   Lance says, “She was wearing a skimpy dress.”  “Skimpy” (skimpy) usually means that yo u are wearing clothing that does not cover very much of your body; letting  other people see a lot of your skin.  This is often a term used to describe wo men’s clothing that does not cover up a great deal of the body.  For example, yo u could say that a dress was skimpy or that an outfit (a set of clothing) was skimpy.  Usually we use this word when the amount of clothing that the person is we aring isn’t appropriate for the occasion.  So if you go to a formal dinner and you w ear, for example, a bikini top, if you’re a man that’s a little strange; if you’re  a woman that would probably be considered a little skimpy, not enough clothing.

Lance says that Kim was wearing a skimpy dress and all of the  men were leering at her.  To “leer” (leer) means to look at someone in  a sexual way.  It’s a negative term to describe the way a man might look at a woman, f or example; it’s not something that a woman would like.  She may say, “Stop leering at me” – stop looking at me in a sexual way.

Lance said, “I used to think she was a nice girl.”  Here, “nice girl” would refer to a young, unmarried women who does everything right, who d oesn’t date a lot of men.  Lance said, “Isn’t she worried that she’ll get a r eputation?”  “Reputation” is a general term to refer to how people think of you – what people think of you. However, if someone says, “he has a reputation,” usually t hey mean he or she has a bad reputation.  For a woman to have a reputati on is to have people think that you are sexually active with many different men, for example, or that you are too sexual.

Paulina says, “A reputation for what?”  Lance says, “For b eing…you know.” Paulina says, “No, I don’t know.”  Lance doesn’t want t o say it directly.  Finally he says, “For being easy!”  “Easy” is a term used to describe a w oman who has sex

 with other men usually soon after she meets them, a wo man who may have many sexual partners.  Once again, it’s usually a negative o r insulting term.  The word “easy” has several meanings in English; take a look at  our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lance says, “It doesn’t take much for people to jump to the wrong conclusions when a woman is dressed like that.”  The expression “to ju mp to the wrong conclusions” means to decide something quickly without necessar ily thinking it through, without looking at all of the evidence, to fo rm a quick and often incorrect opinion about something.  Just looking at someone and ho w they are dressed and deciding what that person is like may be jumping to the wrong conclusion, you are reasoning incorrectly.

Paulina says, “So based on (or because of) one dress she w ore to a party, you’re ready to consider her (Kim) promiscuous.”  “Promiscuous” i s similar to “easy,” it’s someone who has sexual relations with many different peo ple.  Lance says, “No, not just based on that,” that is, not just with that i nformation or because of that information.  Lance says, “The guys at the party were talki ng and one of them said he used to date her, and he said…”  Paulina inter rupts and says, “Now you’re listening to some sleazy guy at a party boasting abou t his conquest.”  To describe someone as “sleazy” means that you are saying that pe rson is immoral or unethical, someone who is not very nice.  It’s a very neg ative way to describe someone.

Paulina says that Lance is listening to some sleazy guy at a party boasting about his conquest.  To “boast” (boast) means to talk about somet hing that you have done so that other people will be envious of you or wi ll think highly of you.  To boast is normally not a good thing, to go around and t ell everyone how good you are, how great you are.  Another word for “to boast” is “to brag” (brag).  So, Paulina is saying that this person – this man, this sleazy gu y, was boasting about his conquest.  To have a “conquest” means to win, to have s ome victory.  Here, it refers to having a sexual relationship another person.  If a man talks about his conquests, he may be talking about women that he has had sexual relations with. Paulina says, “The question is, why are you so ready to gi ve credibility to rumors like that?”  “Credibility” means deserving to be trusted or to be believed in, believability.  If someone lies a lot, you could say that person doesn’t have very much credibility; when they speak no one believes them.  “ Rumors” are information that people tell each other usually about some secret, and often these are things that are not true.

So, Lance is giving credibility – believing in rumors tha t he heard at this party. Lance says, “Whoa (meaning “wait a minute”), don’t go b allistic on me.”  The

 expression “to go ballistic” (ballistic) means to get very an gry, to get very mad at someone very quickly, and perhaps unexpectedly.  The person  wasn’t expecting you to get so angry so quickly.  Lance says, “I was only telling  you what I heard. I thought you might be interested.”  Paulina says, “Well , you thought wrong.” That’s a common expression.  When someone says, “Well, I tho ught that (something something)” (that is, they are thinking somet hing that the other person knows is wrong), the other person may say, “You thou ght wrong,” meaning you are incorrect.  It’s not a nice way to express  your opinion, but it is a very direct way.  Paulina says, “You thought wrong.  I use d to think that women were catty, but you men are much, much worse!”  To be “ca tty” (catty) means to say that someone else is mean or to say bad things about som eone when they are not present (when they are not with you).

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lance:  Did you see Kim at the party last Saturday?

Paulina:  Yeah, I saw her.  Why?

Lance:  She was wearing a skimpy dress and all of the men were leering at her all night.  I used to think she was a nice girl.  Isn’t  she worried that she’ll get a reputation?

Paulina:  A reputation for what?

Lance:  For being…you know.

Paulina:  No, I don’t know.

Lance:  For being easy!  It doesn’t take much for people  to jump to the wrong conclusions when a woman is dressed like that.

Paulina:  So based on one dress she wore to a party, yo u’re ready to consider her promiscuous.

# Buying Car Insurance

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 51: Buying Car Insurance.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 451.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension che cks, and a complete transcript of this episode.

This episode is called “Buying Car Insurance.”  It’s a dial ogue between Jackie and an “agent,” someone who sells insurance for cars.  In it, we’ll use a lot of common vocabulary in talking about cars and car insurance.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Agent:  Hello, Krashit Insurance.

Jackie:  Hi, I wanted to get a quote for car insurance.

Agent:  Sure, I can help you with that.  I assume you wa nt liability insurance, but what other coverage would you like to get?

Jackie:  Umm…I’m not sure.  This is my first car.

Agent:  In that case, let me make a few suggestions.  You ’ll definitely want collision insurance.  It pays to fix your car if you hit ano ther car or run into something.

Jackie:  Okay, sure, I want that.

Agent:  You’ll also want comprehensive insurance.  It pa ys for damage to your car.

Jackie:  How’s it different from collision insurance?

Agent:  Well, it pays for damage to your car that’s not a result of an accident, like in the case of theft, weather damage, or vandalism.

 Jackie:  Okay, I want that, too.

Agent:  You’ll want property damage insurance to pay f or damage you cause to someone else’s property.  On top of that, you’ll want un insured motorist insurance in case the other driver doesn’t have insurance or doesn’t have enough insurance to pay for the damage to your car.

Jackie:  Umm…I guess I’ll take that, too.

Agent:  And I don’t think you can do without medical pa yments insurance.  It pays for your medical bills and those of your passengers in case  of an accident. Should I get you a quote for all of this coverage?

Jackie:  Why don’t you hold off on that?  I’m not sure h ow I’m going to pay for all that and buy gas, too!

[end of dialogue]

This is a telephone conversation between a car insurance  agent, a person who sells car insurance, and Jackie.  The agent answers the phone : “Hello, Krashit Insurance.”  Jackie says, “Hi, I wanted to get a quote for car insurance.”  A “quote” is an estimate, an approximate cost of something , how much something will cost me.  So if you take your car to a mechanic to ge t it fixed, you may ask for an estimate – a quote on how much the repairs wi ll be.  Or if you are having someone come to your house and paint the walls, you woul d first ask for a quote – how much money will it be.  It’s an estimate of the cost of something.  “Quote” has a couple of different meanings in English, however, so take a look at Learning Guide for a complete explanation.

Jackie says she wants a quote for car insurance.  “Insurance” is basically an arrangement where you give money to a company, and if you  have an accident or a problem the company will pay for the repair of th at accident or that problem, depending on what it is.

So, the agent says, “Sure, I can help you with that” – I can give you a quote.  He says, “I assume you want liability insurance.”  “I assume” mea ns I believe that something is true; I am going to believe that it is tru e unless you tell it isn’t.  In the United States, there are a couple of different kinds of car insurance, and usually you are required to have certain kinds of insurance, it d epends on the state where you live.  Liability insurance is one kind of insuran ce.  “Liability” comes from word “liable,” which means to be responsible for something.  There are two

 basic kinds of liability insurance.  One kind is to “cover” you, to pay for any problems you cause to somebody’s health or to a person’s body.  This is sometimes called “bodily liability.”  If, for example, b roke someone’s legs or even killed them, liability insurance would pay them some mo ney, or if they’re dead, of course, their relatives.  That’s one kind of liability insu rance, “bodily injury” it’s sometimes called.  The other kind is if you damage someon e else’s car or someone else’s property, that’s called “property damage” i nsurance; it’s a different kind of liability insurance.

The agent says, “what other coverage would you like to g et?”  “Coverage” are the things that the insurance policy will pay for, will prote ct you against.  So here in California, for example, in Southern California we h ave a lot of earthquakes, where the ground moves suddenly.  You can buy special earth quake insurance for your house; you can also buy fire insurance for your ho use.  Each kind of insurance is different.  The same is true for a car; ther e are different kinds of insurance, the things that the insurance protects is called the coverage.

Well, Jackie says she’s not sure, this is her first car.  The ag ent says, “In that case (in that situation), let me make a few suggestions.  He says, “You definitely want collision insurance.”  “Collision” means two things h it each other, two cars, for example, run into each other; that would be a coll ision.  “Collision insurance” is money that the insurance company will give you if your car is damaged.  That is, it doesn’t pay for the other person’s car; it pays for  your car.  Most states do not require that you have collision insurance, but it’s often a good idea.  The agent explains that collision insurance pays to fix your car  if you hit another car or run into something.  To “run into” means to hit so mething else, especially when you are driving.  Generally, that is not a good id ea!

Jackie says, “Okay, sure, I want that.”  Then the agent says, “You’ll also want comprehensive insurance.  It pays for damage to your car.”  “Damage” is physical harm that comes to something.  If you take water and you pour it onto your laptop, as I did once, that will damage your compu ter; it will cause damage. The word can be both a noun and a verb.

Jackie says, “How is (comprehensive insurance) different from co llision insurance?”  The agent explains that comprehensive insuran ce pays for damage to your car that is not the result of an accident – it i s not because of an accident. An “accident” is, in this case, the same as a collision o r a crash, when your car hits something else.  Comprehensive insurance pays for thi ngs in addition to accidents, for example in the case of theft.  “In the case of (something)” means if something happens in a particular situation.  “Theft” i s when someone steals something from you – steals your car, in this case.  Compre hensive insurance

 will pay for your car if someone steals it.  Comprehensive  insurance will also pay for “weather damage,” if you have bad weather and th at damages your car.  It will also pay if you are a victim of vandalism.  A “victim” is so meone who is hurt by someone else or something.  “Vandalism” means someone tr ies to damage your property by throwing something on it or by doing somethi ng that would cause it to be harmed in some way.  They may, for example, paint on it or take a rock and throw it at it, that would be an example of vandalism .  If you don’t have comprehensive insurance and your car is vandalized or stolen, you won’t get any money for it.  I discovered this when I had a car many ye ars ago here in Los Angeles, and it was stolen.  I later discovered that I d id not have comprehensive insurance, and so I didn’t get any money from the insuran ce company.

Jackie says, “Okay, I want that, too.”  The agent says, “You’ ll want property damage insurance to pay for damage you cause to someone else’s property.” We already talked about liability insurance, which pays for  damage you do to someone else or something else.  This is a type of liabi lity insurance: property damage insurance.  The agent says, “On top of that (mea ning in addition to that), you’ll want uninsured motorist insurance in case the other  driver doesn’t have insurance or doesn’t have enough insurance to pay for the damage to your car” – if they hit you, and they are the ones who are responsibl e.  So, “uninsured” means not insured.  Even though the law in most states re quires that all drivers have insurance, sometimes people don’t do that – they do n’t buy the insurance. And, of course, if the other person hits you and it’s th eir fault, their insurance should pay for the damages done to your car.  But if th ey don’t have any insurance, then you can use your own uninsured motorist i nsurance.  A “motorist” is just another name for a person who drives a car.

Jackie says, “Umm…I guess I’ll take that, too.”  Of course, the  insurance agent is trying to sell her as much insurance as possible.  The ag ent says, “And I don’t think you can do without medical payments insurance.”  The  expression “can’t do without” means that you must have something.  “Medical payments insurance” is money that is paid for your medical expenses and for the o ther people who may have been in your car if there is an accident and they are  injured, if they break their leg or their arm for example.

The agent says, “It pays for your medical bills and those of your passengers (the other people in the car) in case of an accident.  Shoul d I get you a quote for all of this coverage?”  Jackie says, “Why don’t you hold off on tha t?”  To “hold off on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to wait to do som ething, to delay something.  So, Jackie’s saying no, I don’t want a quote r ight now, let’s do that later.  “I’m not sure how I’m going to pay for all t hat and buy gas, too!”  She

 doesn’t know if she’ll have the money to pay for all of these different kinds of insurance.

As I said previously, in most states there’s a minimum amou nt of insurance that you must have, but it doesn’t necessarily mean all of thes e kinds of insurance.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Agent:  Hello, Krashit Insurance.

Jackie:  Hi, I wanted to get a quote for car insurance.

Agent:  Sure, I can help you with that.  I assume you wa nt liability insurance, but what other coverage would you like to get?

Jackie:  Umm…I’m not sure.  This is my first car.

Agent:  In that case, let me make a few suggestions.  You ’ll definitely want collision insurance.  It pays to fix your car if you hit ano ther car or run into something.

Jackie:  Okay, sure, I want that.

Agent:  You’ll want property damage insurance to pay f or damage you cause to someone else’s property.  On top of that, you’ll want un insured motorist insurance in case the other driver doesn’t have insurance or doesn’t have enough insurance to pay for the damage to your car.

# Dealing with Unhappy Employees

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 52: Dealing with Unhappy Employees.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 452.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page guide that will help you im prove your English even faster.

This episode is called “Dealing with Unhappy Employees.”  It’s a dialogue between Asa and Samantha, and it talks about some common  problems that you might have at work.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Asa:  I don’t know how we got stuck with reviewing employe e complaints.  This has got to be the worst job ever!

Samantha:  This is important work and somebody has to do it.  Come on, let’s get started.

Asa:  I think it’s bad for morale to allow employees to file complaints.  We’re all overworked and underpaid, and most of us are burned ou t.

Samantha:  How else are disgruntled employees going to voice their grievances?

Asa:  Personally, I think it’s stupid for employees to put their complaints on paper.  Aren’t they worried about retaliation from the management?

Samantha:  I don’t think that’s going to happen.  The  whole point of having this system is to resolve any problems before they get blown ou t of proportion.  It’s to everybody’s benefit to try to make this work.

Asa:  On the contrary, I think it makes for a dysfunction al workplace: Employees thinking of things to complain about and the manageme nt with their backs up against the wall.  I just don’t get it.

 Samantha:  No, I guess you don’t.  If you don’t like ho w things are done around here, I’ve got a suggestion for you.

Asa:  What?

Samantha:  File a complaint.

[end of dialogue]

The title of this episode is “Dealing with Unhappy Emp loyees.”  To “deal with” means to take care of a problem, to solve or resolve some s ort of problem.

Asa says, “I don’t know how we got stuck with reviewing empl oyee complaints.” To “get stuck with (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning  to be forced to do something that is boring or unpleasant, to have to do something you don’t want to do: “I cooked dinner and my wife got stuck with washing  the dishes.”  Asa is saying that he doesn’t know how they got stuck with “revie wing,” or looking at, employee complaints.  A “complaint” is something negative  that is said or written, and usually comes with an explanation about why someone do esn’t like something.

Asa says, “This has got to be the worst job ever.”  Samant ha says, “This is important work, and somebody has to do it.  Come on, le t’s get started,” she says.  Asa says, “I think it’s bad for morale to allow emplo yees to file complaints.” “Morale” (morale) is the way that a group of people, especially employees, feel about their jobs (their opinions, what they think about  their jobs).  It’s the general feeling that they have.  Morale can either be high or low.  If you say, “My employees have low morale,” you mean they’re not very int erested, they’re not very happy, they’re not very excited.  The opposite would be  high morale.

Asa is saying that it’s bad for morale to have the employe es “file,” or submit (give to the company) their complaints.  He says, “We’re all o verworked and underpaid, and most of us are burned out.”  To be “ov erworked” means to have too much work and to work too hard, making you tired.  We all think that we are overworked, I’m sure!  To be “underpaid” means that you don’t get enough money for the work that you do.  Once again, most people  think that they are overworked and underpaid.  This can cause some people to burn out.  To “burn out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become tired  from having done too much of something for too long.  So, if you continue to  do the same thing year after year and it’s very difficult, you could eventually bu rn out; you could get to the point where you’re too tired to want to continue,  that you’re no longer effective at what you do.

 Samantha says, “How else are disgruntled employees going t o voice their grievances?”  “Disgruntled” means unhappy, disappointed, p erhaps even angry. “To voice” means to express something in words, to say someth ing.  “Voice,” like “burn out,” has different meanings in English; take a l ook at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of both of those terms.   Samantha is saying that she doesn’t know how these upset, angry, disgruntled em ployees are going to “voice their grievances,” are going to tell the company w hat they don’t like.  A “grievance” is like a complaint that is said or written  with an explanation.  Often, it is related to people thinking that there is something unfair or that they haven’t been treated right by their company.

Asa says, “Personally (in my opinion), I think it’s stupid for employees to put their complaints on paper.”  “On paper” just means in writing , written down.  “Aren’t they worried about retaliation from the management?”   “Retaliation” means revenge, something that you do to hurt another person w ho has hurt you.  So, if I punch you, you could retaliate and punch me back.  Asa is sa ying that if the employees complain, the company could retaliate against t hem – could do something negative, something bad to them.

Samantha says, “I don’t think that’s going to happen.  T he whole point (the main reason) of having this system is to resolve any problems befo re they get blown out of proportion.”  To “resolve” means to solve, to fix or end a problem.  So, they’re trying to fix any problems with the employees befo re they get blown out of proportion.  To “blow (something) out of proportion”  means to make it more important or more serious than it really is or than it has to be.  So, you’re trying to stop the problems when they’re small, before they get t oo big.

Samantha says, “It’s to everybody’s benefit to try to make th is work.”  Asa says, “On the contrary,” meaning I think it’s the exact opposi te; I disagree with you.  He says, “On the contrary, I think it makes for a dysfunctional w orkplace.”  Asa is saying that he thinks it “makes for,” meaning it causes, a dysfunctional workplace.  “Dysfunctional” means not functional; not worki ng properly, especially when people have bad relationships with each ot her.  There’s a popular expression you’ll read or hear about called “th e dysfunctional family.”  It would be a family that doesn’t communicate very well wi th each other, doesn’t have good relationships with each other.  Asa says, “employe es thinking of things to complain about and the management with thei r backs up against the wall.”  Asa is saying this is why it causes a dysfunctional wor kplace, because the employees are thinking of things to complain about and t he managers – the management has their backs up against the wall.  “To have  one’s back up against the wall” means to be in a position where you d on’t have a lot of options

 or choices, that you’re forced to do something without ne cessarily having a lot of flexibility.

Asa says, “I just don’t get it” – I don’t understand.  S amantha says, “No, I guess you don’t (meaning no, you don’t understand).  If you don’t like how things are done around here, I’ve got a suggestion for you.”  Asa sa ys, “What?”  Samantha says, “File a complaint.”  Of course, that’s what Asa was co mplaining about: employee complaints.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Asa:  I don’t know how we got stuck with reviewing employe e complaints.  This has got to be the worst job ever!

Samantha:  This is important work and somebody has to do it.  Come on, let’s get started.

Asa:  I think it’s bad for morale to allow employees to file complaints.  We’re all overworked and underpaid, and most of us are burned ou t.

Samantha:  How else are disgruntled employees going to voice their grievances?

Asa:  Personally, I think it’s stupid for employees to put their complaints on paper.  Aren’t they worried about retaliation from the management?

Samantha:  I don’t think that’s going to happen.  The  whole point of having this system is to resolve any problems before they get blown ou t of proportion.  It’s to everybody’s benefit to try to make this work.

Asa:  On the contrary, I think it makes for a dysfunction al workplace: Employees thinking of things to complain about and the manageme nt with their backs up against the wall.  I just don’t get it.

Samantha:  No, I guess you don’t.  If you don’t like ho w things are done around here, I’ve got a suggestion for you.

Asa:  What?

Samantha:  File a complaint.

# Making an Emergency Medical Call

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 53: Making an Emergency Medical Call.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 453.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in (guess where?) beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In case you don’t know, we have a website; it’s at eslpod.c om.  If you go there, you can download this episode’s Learning Guide, which wil l help you improve your English.  It will also make you stronger and more b eautiful!

This episode is called “Making an Emergency Medical Call.”  It’s a telephone conversation between an “emergency operator” (somebody wh o answers the phone calls for the government’s police and fire emergen cy system) and someone who has an emergency.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Operator:  Emergency operator.  State your emergency.

Dirk:  We need an ambulance right away.

Operator:  What is your name?

Dirk:  Dirk, Dirk Omora.

Operator:  Can you tell me what happened?

Dirk:  There was a car accident.

Operator:  Where are you?

Dirk:  I’m not sure.  I was driving in my car when I saw the pileup.  I’m somewhere on Blossom Road.  Can you trace my location?

Operator:  Yes, we’ll try to do that.  Can you see if  anyone is hurt?

Dirk:  One of the drivers is lying on the ground unconsciou s, and the other one is bleeding.  There’s someone trapped in the back of her c ar, too.  We need to rescue her before the car explodes!  I’m going to see if  I can help.

 Operator:  Sir, I need you to stay on the line.  I’m se nding an ambulance right now, and they’ll have the Jaws of Life and other equipm ent to do the job.  The paramedics will be there very soon.

Dirk:  Okay, but hurry!

[end of dialogue]

In the United States when you have an emergency, you dia l three numbers on your telephone: 9-1-1.  So, this is a case where someone calls 9-1-1 and the operator answers saying, “Emergency operator.”  An “emerg ency” is an unexpected situation that is dangerous or very serious; it’ s something that you have to react to right away.  The operator says to Dirk, the person calling, “State your emergency.”  To “state” here means to say something, to give the information.  If you go, for example, to a court in the United States, the judge may ask you: “State your name,” meaning tell me what your na me is.  “State” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for a complete explanation.

Dirk says, “We need an ambulance right away.”  An “ambul ance” is a special car (a van) that is driven usually very quickly, with loud noises and bright lights, to help people who have urgent or emergency medical condit ions.  The ambulance goes and picks the person up and takes them to the nearest hospital.  The ambulance is allowed to go faster than anyone else, and if you hear or see an ambulance that has its lights on and is making noises with what we would call the “sirens” of the ambulance, you are required in the U.S.  to stop your car, to move it to the side of the road so the ambulance can go thro ugh.

Well, Dirk says they need an ambulance right away.  The op erator says, “What is your name?”  Dirk says, “Dirk, Dirk Omora.”  The operator then says, “Can you tell me what happened?”  The operator is asking for mo re specific information. Dirk says, “There was a car accident.”  A “car accident” is a collision (or a crash) between two or more cars, when one car hits another car  or when one car hits an object, like a tree for example.

The operator says, “Where are you?”  Dirk says, “I’m not su re.  I was driving in my car when I saw the pileup.”  A “pileup” is a large, serious car accident that involves many different cars.  For example, if it is very icy o n the freeway, or if there is a lot of fog and it is difficult for drivers t o see, one car could hit the car in front of it, then the car behind it hits that car, the n another car, then another car. Sometimes these pileups can be 20, 30, 50, or more cars.   Usually this is caused

 in part because people are driving too close to each othe r, but sometimes it’s simply because of bad weather.

Dirk says that he was driving in his car when he saw this pil eup.  He says he’s somewhere on Blossom Road.  He then asks the operator, “C an you trace my location?”  To “trace” (trace) means to figure out wher e something is or where something is coming from.  In the U.S., if you are call ing from a phone that is in your house or at a building and you call 9-1-1, usually they know exactly where you are – they can tell where you are.  If you have a cell  phone it is, of course, much more difficult, although now in many places they can also figure out approximately where you are, even when you have a cell ph one.

The operator says, “Yes, we’ll try to do that” (we can tr ace your location).  She says, “Can you see if anyone is hurt?”  To be “hurt” means to be injured.  You break your leg, you break your arm, maybe you hit your he ad; those would be “injuries.”  Dirk says, “One of the drivers is lying on the ground unconscious, and the other one is bleeding.”  To be “unconscious” means t hat you’re not aware of what is around you.  Usually your eyes are closed, you can’t h ear anyone; it’s basically like being asleep, but it’s often caused because yo u hit your head hard against something.

Well, one person is unconscious on the road (on the gro und), and one is bleeding.  To “bleed” (bleed) means to lose blood, wh en blood is coming out of your body – that red liquid that comes out of your bod y if you cut yourself, for example.  Dirk says, “There’s someone trapped in the back of her car, too.”  To be “trapped” means to be somewhere where you can’t move , you can’t get out, you can’t leave a place usually because something is in your way – a person or a thing.  “Trap” can also be a noun.  If somebody says, “thi s is a trap,” they mean someone is trying to get us in trouble or cause us problem s on purpose in order to do something bad to us afterwards.  Here, it means to be unable to move, not to be able to leave a place.

So, there’s someone trapped in the back of the car.  Dir k says, “We need to rescue her before the car explodes!”  Sounds like a televi sion program!  “We need to rescue her.”  To “rescue” someone means to save so meone, to help someone get out of a difficult or dangerous situation.  The person is trapped in the back of the car, and because there is gasoline in the car, when there’s an accident there’s a danger that the car might catch on fi re – might explode.  To “explode” means to make a large noise and to break into smaller pieces usually with fire, and in this case, that’s what would be the situation: the car could catch on fire.

 Dirk says, “I’m going to see if I can help.”  The operato r then says, “Sir, I need you to stay on the line.”  To “stay on the line” means n ot to hang up the phone, not to stop or disconnect your phone connection, to conti nue to talk to someone and not leave to do something else.  So, the operator  is saying I need you to stay on your phone – to stay on the line.  “I’m sending an ambulance right now, and they’ll have the Jaws of Life and other equipment to do  the job.”  The “Jaws of Life” is a large machine that can cut a hole in somethi ng to help people get out of a car, for example, after a serious accident.  So, it’s a  special machine.  The operator is sending this machine and other equipment to  do the job.  “To do the job” means to do something well, to do something correct ly.  The operator says, “The paramedics will be there very soon.”  A “paramedic”  is a person who is not a nurse or a doctor, but who is trained to help people in medical emergencies, someone who picks them up in the ambulance and then take s them back to the hospital.  One of my brother-in-laws is a paramedic (wor ks in an ambulance).

Finally Dirk says, “Okay, but hurry!”  To “hurry” means to d o something quickly, to rush, to get it done right away.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Operator:  Emergency operator.  State your emergency.

Dirk:  We need an ambulance right away.

Operator:  What is your name?

Dirk:  Dirk, Dirk Omora.

Operator:  Can you tell me what happened?

Dirk:  There was a car accident.

Operator:  Where are you?

Dirk:  I’m not sure.  I was driving in my car when I saw the pileup.  I’m somewhere on Blossom Road.  Can you trace my location?

Operator:  Yes, we’ll try to do that.  Can you see if  anyone is hurt?

 Dirk:  One of the drivers is lying on the ground unconsciou s, and the other one is bleeding.  There’s someone trapped in the back of her c ar, too.  We need to rescue her before the car explodes!  I’m going to see if  I can help.

Operator:  Sir, I need you to stay on the line.  I’m se nding an ambulance right now, and they’ll have the Jaws of Life and other equipm ent to do the job.  The paramedics will be there very soon.

Dirk:  Okay, but hurry!

# Hailing and Taking a Taxi

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 54: Hailing and Taking a Taxi.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 454.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go now to our website at eslpod.com and download a Lea rning Guide for this episode.  You can follow along with the transcript of  everything we say and also have a list of vocabulary words, cultural notes, comprehensi on questions, and some additional definitions not found on the audio po rtion of this episode.

This episode is called “Hailing and Taking a Taxi.”  To “ hail a taxi” means to stop a taxi, to get a taxi’s attention so that the car will st op.  This episode is going to be using some very typical vocabulary that you might use if you take a taxi in the U.S.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

My company sent me on my first business trip, and I was suppo sed to travel around the city in taxis.  Having never ridden in a taxi b efore, I had problems from start to finish.

First, I had trouble hailing a cab.  I didn’t realize  that when the taxi’s light is off that the cabbie is off duty.  No wonder they took no no tice of me.

Then, a cab did pull over and I told him where I want ed to go.  He said, though, that he wouldn’t take me because he wouldn’t be able t o get a return fare!

I was looking around for a taxi stand when another cab p ulled over, but my troubles didn’t stop there.

Cabbie:  Where to?

Ignacio:  I’d like to go the Hamilton Building downto wn.  There’s a flat rate, isn’t there?

Cabbie:  No, we don’t have flat rates.

Ignacio:  But a flat rate to downtown is required by l aw, isn’t it?

 Cabbie:  Do you want to go downtown or not?  I’ve alr eady started the meter.

Ignacio:  Where are your posted rates?

Cabbie:  We don’t have any.  The first mile is $3.50 a nd each quarter mile is $2.00.

Ignacio:  That doesn’t sound right to me.  I think I’ll  try another cab.

Cabbie:  Suit yourself!

I remembered what my co-worker told me.  She said to ste er clear of private cabs, like this one.  The cabbies don’t have licenses and so me of them will really take you for a ride – and not the kind you want!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is about Ignacio who is on a business trip.  H e says, “My company sent me on my first business trip, and I was supposed to t ravel around the city in taxis.”  He was “supposed to,” it was recommended or orde red that he do that. He has to travel around in “taxis,” which is the plural f or taxi or taxicab or cab; all of those words mean the same thing.  It’s a car that you basically pay the driver to take you to where you want to go.  He says, “Having ne ver ridden in a taxi before (meaning having never taken a taxi – been inside a taxi), I had problems from start to finish.”  The expression “from start to fin ish” is a common one to mean the entire time, for the entire time that I wa s doing something.  For example: “The professor walked into class and spent an enti re hour yelling at his class from start to finish” – the entire time.

He says, “First, I had trouble hailing a cab.”  As we said  before, “to hail” (hail) a cab or a taxi or a taxicab means to get their attention,  often by waving your hand so that they will stop for you.  This is very common in some cities such as New York City, where you, if you are in what they call in N ew York City “the City,” Manhattan – the main island where the businesses are most ly in New York City, you can stand at the corner or stand in the street and wa ve your hand to get a taxicab to stop for you.  Here in Los Angeles that is not  common, taxis are not as common here in L.A.  In fact, in most places you cannot hail a cab, you have to go to what’s called a “cab stand,” which we’ll talk abo ut in a minute.

Back to our story: He says that he had trouble hailing a cab.  He didn’t realize that when the taxi’s light is off that the cabbie is of f duty.  The taxi cars have

 lights usually on the top of the car, if the light is on  that means that the taxi is available, they can stop and pick you up.  If the light is off, that means that they are already occupied and they will not stop.  Well, Igna cio, since he doesn’t have much experience with taxis (and apparently has never seen a  movie with a taxi!) didn’t realize that the taxi’s light is off, and he was trying to hail the cabs.  He says, “the cabbie (when the light is off) is off duty.”  The “cabbie” is same as the taxicab driver; cabbie is the person who drives the cab or t he taxi.  To be “off duty” means to be not working or no longer on the job.   If the taxi’s cab light is off, he could have someone already in his car or he could be o ff duty.  Ignacio then says, “No wonder they took no notice of me.”  To “take no tice of someone” means to realize that they are there, to acknowledge th em, to show or indicate that you see them.  But, because the taxicabs were eithe r busy or off duty, they took no notice of Ignacio – they didn’t stop.

“Then,” he says, “a cab did pull over and I told him wh ere I wanted to go.”  To “pull over” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to have a car or a truck stop at the side of the road; to stop the car and usually park it on the side of the road, at least temporarily.  So, one of the cabs did pull over –  did stop.  “He said, though (he said, however), that he wouldn’t take me because he wouldn’t be able to get a return fare!”  A “fare” (fare) when we’re talking about taxis is a person who is paying for the taxi.  So, the taxicab driver has a fare, meaning they have a customer.  In this case, “return fare” means that the ta xicab driver will go to a certain place then they’ll turn around and come back, if  they have someone with them that they pick up on the way back that would be a re turn fare.  Some taxis don’t want to go to certain places because there aren’t very many people there and they won’t have anyone paying them to drive back to the main part of the city.

“I was looking around for a taxi stand,” Ignacio says, “whe n another cab pulled over.”  A “taxi stand” is a place, often by a hotel or a busy public area, where there are taxis that are parked one behind another, us ually several taxis, and you can go there and get a taxi.  Here in Los Angeles, for example, when you come out of the airport there are several taxi stands where t here are several taxis waiting for people who want a ride – who need a rid e.  That’s a taxi stand.  Here Los Angeles, you can get a taxi by going to a taxi stand o r by calling a taxi company to come to your house or business.  It is not norma lly possible to hail a taxi in Los Angeles.

Well, Ignacio was still having some problems.  The cabbie asks him, “Where to?” meaning where do you want to go.  Ignacio says, “I’d like  to go the Hamilton Building downtown.  There’s a flat rate, isn’t there? ”  A “flat rate” is a single fixed price; “rate” is the same as price, here.  So, a “fixed r ate” is one price that you

 pay – that everyone pays, usually from a certain area of t own to another area of town.  Again, using Los Angeles as an example, if you arr ive at the airport and you want to go to a hotel in the downtown area there ’s a flat rate.  No matter which hotel you go to (some may be closer than others) you will be charged the same fare.  Notice that “fare” here means that same amo unt of money; it can mean both the person who’s paying the money and the money you receive.

Well, the cabbie says, “No, we don’t have flat rates.”  Ignacio says, “But a flat rate to downtown is required by law, isn’t it?”  He’s sa ying that the taxicab driver must him to pay only the flat rate.  The cabbie, however , says, “Do you want to go downtown or not?” meaning I’m not going to charge  you the flat rate, and if you don’t want to pay more, I’m going to leave.  The ca bbie says, “I’ve already started the meter.”  The “meter” in a taxi is a little  machine that tells you how far or how long you’ve traveled, and in most cities the amou nt that you pay depends on how far you go.  The meter tells you how far you’ve gone or how long you’ve been in the car.

Ignacio then asks the cabbie, “Where are your posted rates? ”  Every city has laws that determine how much a taxicab driver can charge per mile or per half mile or quarter mile, and these are supposed to be rat es that you can find inside the taxicab – in the car.  The cabbie says, however, “We d on’t have any.  The first mile is $3.50 and each quarter mile is $2.00.”  I gnacio says, “That doesn’t sound right to me,” meaning that is wrong, that’s too much.  “I think I’ll try another cab,” he very wisely – very intelligently says.  First intell igent thing Ignacio has done!  The cabbie says, “Suit yourself!” meaning do what ever you want.  The expression “suit yourself” means you do whatever you want, I ’m not going to bother you or be bothered by you.  Usually we use this exp ression when you don’t agree with what the person is doing, and you are  telling them to go ahead and do it but you think they’re wrong, basically.

Ignacio says that his “co-worker,” someone he works with, h ad warned him to steer clear of private cabs.  To “steer (steer) clear of” so mething or someone means to avoid, to not go near, to not get involved wit h.  He should steer clear of private cabs, cabs that do not have “licenses,” official p ermission from the city to operate as a taxicab driver.  “They really will take you f or a ride,” he says.  “They will really take you for a ride” means they will really st eal your money.  To take someone for a ride usually means, in this case, to steal  their money or to charge more money than they should – to cheat them.  It can also  mean simply to get into a car and drive somewhere, but that’s the double m eaning that Ignacio was using here.  He says, “They will really take you for a rid e – and not the kind you want!” meaning not an actual ride, but using the mean ing of the expression to take your money.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

My company sent me on my first business trip, and I was suppo sed to travel around the city in taxis.  Having never ridden in a taxi b efore, I had problems from start to finish.

First, I had trouble hailing a cab.  I didn’t realize  that when the taxi’s light is off that the cabbie is off duty.  No wonder they took no no tice of me.

# Ending a Bad Date

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 55: Ending a Bad Date.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 455.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

We have a website, it’s eslpod.com.  On it, you can find a  Learning Guide for this episode that contains additional information to help yo u improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Ending a Bad Date.”  It’s a dial ogue between Fatima and Rob, who are on a romantic date together that doesn’t  go very well.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I was on a date from hell.

I agreed to go out with this guy who lives in the same a partment building as I do, but he’s turned out to be a real creep.  He was nice en ough at the start of the date, but then he started drinking.  Now he’s drunk and  I’m miserable.

I wanted to let him down gently since I’d be seeing him  around the apartment building, but I didn’t want to spend another minute with him.

Fatima:  Listen, Rob, I just don’t think we’re hitting  it off.  You’re a really nice guy, but I just don’t think we have much chemistry.

Rob:  Are you kidding?  I’m having the time of my life.   We’re just getting started here.  Bartender, another round!

I realized that I needed to be more straightforward w ith him in case I was giving him mixed signals.

Fatima:  I’m sorry, Rob, but I think this is the end of the road for this date. Thanks a lot for the drinks and I’ll see you around.

Rob:  What?  You’re leaving?  How about a goodnight kiss?  Come over here and give me that kiss.

 I wanted to keep my cool, but when he tried to kiss me, t hat did it!

Fatima:  You’re stinking drunk and this date is over.  C apisce?

I got up and left.  What is it about alcohol that tu rns Prince Charming into a frog?

[end of dialogue]

Fatima begins our story by saying, “I was on a date from h ell.”  The expression “from hell” means as bad as something can possibly be, ter rible, horrible.  “I’m on a date from hell” means I’m on a very bad date.  A “da te,” of course, is when two people romantically interested in each other go to dinn er or to a movie, do something together.

Well Fatima, unfortunately, is on a terrible date – a  date from hell.  She says, “I agreed to go out with (to go on a date with) this gu y who lives in the same apartment building as I do, but,” Fatima says, “he’s tu rned out to be a real creep.” When we say someone has “turned out to be (something),” we mean that our initial impressions (what we thought at the beginning ) has changed because the person has demonstrated that they are not what we thoug ht they were.  A “creep” (creep) is a very unpleasant person who makes you feel uncom fortable.  “Creep” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a lo ok at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Fatima says that this guy was nice enough at the start of the date, but then he started drinking – drinking alcohol.  “Now he’s drunk and  I’m miserable.”  When we say is someone is “drunk,” we mean that they are intoxica ted, meaning that they have drank too much wine or beer or alcohol, and now they are not acting normally because of the influence of the alcohol on thei r behavior.  Fatima says, “I wanted to let him down gently.”  To “let (someone ) down” means to disappoint someone, to do or say something that makes the other per son feel sad.  In this case, what Fatima means is that she wants to tell him “no ,” but doesn’t want to hurt him or hurt his feelings.  That’s why she says, “I wanted to let him down gently.”  “Gently” means nicely, in this case.  He lives in  the same apartment building as Fatima, but she did not want to be on thi s date any more, so she says to him, “Listen, Rob, I just don’t think we’re hittin g it off.”  To “hit it off” is an expression that means to enjoy spending time with someone,  to be friendly with someone right after you meet them.  So, you meet them  and immediately you are comfortable with them, you enjoy being with them.  We would say, “they hit it off.” It can be used in a romantic situation, but it could also  be used in a business

 situation: “The saleswoman and the manager hit it off ,” they got along very well together.

Fatima says to Rob, “You’re a really nice guy, but I just  don’t think we have much chemistry.”  “Chemistry,” here, means the feelings between  two people, whether they are romantically interested in each other.  Chemistr y can also refer to chemicals or the study of chemicals in the world, but here it means the romantic feelings.  Fatima is saying she doesn’t think that there are romantic feelings between them.

Rob is quite surprised.  Of course, he’s drunk so almost anyt hing would probably surprise him!  He says, “Are you kidding (are you joking)?   I’m having the time of my life.”  When someone says they’re “having the time of t heir life” they mean they’re having one of the best experiences or moments of  their life; they’re doing something that they enjoy very much.  Rob says, “We’re just  getting started here,” we’re just beginning our date.  Then he calls o ut to the “bartender,” the person who prepares and gives you your drinks in a bar.  H e says, “Bartender, another round!”  A “round” is usually a series of events,  a group of things that are repeated different times.  Here, in a bar, the term “round” means another set of drinks – another drink.  So, someone may say for example, “I’ll buy the next round of drinks,” they mean the next drink that you want to order I’ll pay for.  Rob, here, is asking the bartender for another drink – anot her round.  “Round” has several meanings in English, as you probably know; take a lo ok at our Learning Guide for some more explanations of that term.

Poor Fatima says that she realized she needed to be more  straightforward with Rob.  When we say you need to be “straightforward” (on e word) we mean that you need to be more direct, you need to say something more clearly.  Instead of saying, “Oh, well, um, I don’t think so, probably not,” you need to say, “No, absolutely not.”  So Fatima needs to be more direct – m ore straightforward with Rob.  She doesn’t want to give him mixed signals.  The expression “mixed signals” means using actions or words that indicate one thi ng but really mean something else.  Or, mixed signals can mean confusing message s, when a person can’t understand what you mean because you say one th ing that’s good then maybe one thing that’s bad and it isn’t very clear.

Well, Fatima doesn’t want to send mixed signals to Rob; she doesn’t want Rob to think that she is romantically interested in him.  We wou ld say she doesn’t want to “lead him on,” which is when a woman or a man make s the other person think that they are interested in them, but are really not.  So, Fatima says, “I’m sorry, Rob, but I think this is the end of the road for this d ate.”  “The end of the road” is the end of something, it’s the finish, it cannot go on any more.  If your girlfriend

 says to you, “This is the end of the road for you and for our relationship,” you might want to start looking for another girlfriend.  I’ve been to the end of the road many times!

Fatima says, “Thanks a lot for the drinks and I’ll see you around,” meaning I’ll see you later.  Rob still doesn’t believe what is happening .  He says, “What?  You’re leaving?  How about a goodnight kiss?”  A “goodnight kiss”  is a kiss at the end of a date.  Usually when a man takes the woman back to where  she lives, he says “good night” and gives her a kiss.  That’s a goodnight kiss;  it’s a romantic kiss usually on your first or one of your first dates with a wo man or a man.

Rob wants to give Fatima a goodnight kiss, which, of course , Fatima is not interested in.  She says, “I wanted to keep my cool,” me aning I wanted to stay calm, to remain in control, not to get angry.  “But wh en he tried to kiss me, that did it!” meaning that was enough, that caused me to ch ange my actions.  She then says to Rob, “You’re stinking drunk and this date is o ver.”  “Stinking drunk” is a phrase that is used to describe someone who has had to o much alcohol and whose words and actions are very unpleasant, someone who sta rts yelling or screaming or saying bad things after they drank too much a lcohol.  Fatima then says, “Capisce?”  “Capisce” we use in English to mean do you understand.  It comes originally from the Italian, but Americans give it their own American pronunciation: we say “capisce,” the Italian pronunciatio n I think would be “capisce,” but we say “capisce.”

Fatima says she got up and left.  Then she asks, “What is it about alcohol that turns Prince Charming into a frog?”  “Prince Charming”  is a handsome, brave man in a children’s story.  Prince Charming saves the bea utiful woman – the princess – and falls in love with her.  We use this term , “Prince Charming,” to refer to the ideal husband or the ideal man for a wo man, the person that every woman is looking for – her Prince Charming.  The refer ence to the frog is that in some children’s stories when a girl kisses a frog, the frog becomes (turns into) a man – this beautiful, handsome man, Prince Charming.   I think the idea here is that a woman can take a man and change him, which is pro bably not the best philosophy to have if you are looking for a husband or a  wife.  Men are more difficult to change than it appears – trust me!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

I was on a date from hell.

 I agreed to go out with this guy who lives in the same a partment building as I do, but he’s turned out to be a real creep.  He was nice en ough at the start of the date, but then he started drinking.  Now he’s drunk and  I’m miserable.

I wanted to let him down gently since I’d be seeing him  around the apartment building, but I didn’t want to spend another minute with him.

Fatima:  Listen, Rob, I just don’t think we’re hitting  it off.  You’re a really nice guy, but I just don’t think we have much chemistry.

Rob:  Are you kidding?  I’m having the time of my life.   We’re just getting started here.  Bartender, another round!

I realized that I needed to be more straightforward w ith him in case I was giving him mixed signals.

Fatima:  I’m sorry, Rob, but I think this is the end of the road for this date. Thanks a lot for the drinks and I’ll see you around.

Rob:  What?  You’re leaving?  How about a goodnight kiss?  Come over here and give me that kiss.

I wanted to keep my cool, but when he tried to kiss me, t hat did it!

Fatima:  You’re stinking drunk and this date is over.  C apisce?

I got up and left.  What is it about alcohol that tu rns Prince Charming into a frog?

[end of dialogue]

This is the end of the road for this episode.  We’d like  to thank Dr. Lucy Tse for writing the script for this episode.

# Sending Business Packages

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 56: Sending Business Packages.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 456.  I am your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, and I am coming to you from beautiful Los Angeles, California, at the Center for Educational Development.

Go to our website at eslpod.com to download a Learning  Guide for this episode. The Learning Guides contain all of the vocabulary, defi nitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension qu estions, and a complete transcript of everything I say on this episode so you can fol low along as you listen.

This episode is called “Sending Business Packages.”  It’s a d ialogue between Sam and Maria using some common vocabulary you would hear if you were going to send a package, a large box for example, for you r business.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Maria:  I need this package to arrive in Tulsa by next Wed nesday.

Sam:  Sure, I’ll send it UPS or FedEx using their grou nd service.  It’ll be cheaper than sending it using their overnight service and we can st ill track it.  Is it going to a business?

Maria:  Yes, it is.

Sam:  Okay, I’ll mark that it’s going to a commercial add ress.

Maria:  That’s fine.  I’ll also need these contracts to g et to Tokyo by Friday.  Send it to the home of the president of the company.

Sam:  I’ll send it DHL and use the residential delivery service.  This seems like a large package for just contracts.

Maria:  I’m also including a gift for the president’s w ife.

Sam:  If it’s breakable, I’ll pack it really well and th en get it insured.  What’s the declared value?

 Maria:  It’s about $700.  Oh, and I want this box to g o to Olten, Switzerland, but just send it regular mail through the post office.  Make  sure I get delivery confirmation, though.

Sam:  No problem.  I’ll just need to fill out a custom s declaration form.  What are the contents?

Maria:  They’re books.

Sam:  Okay, I’ll take care of it.

Maria:  Thanks.  What would I do without you?

Sam:  The real question is, what would the mail services do without you?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Maria saying to Sam, “I need this package to arrive in Tulsa by next Wednesday.”  Tulsa is a city in the state of O klahoma, which is right in the middle (central) part of the United Sta tes.  A “package” describes any sort of box or perhaps a large envelope that you are s ending to someone.  Sam says, “Sure, I’ll send it UPS or FedEx using their ground  service.”  UPS stands for United Parcel Service, FedEx stands for Federal Express;  those are two private mail companies in the United States that you can  use to send packages if you need them to get there quickly.  “Ground service,” or simply we often just say sending it “ground,” means that it is going to go into  a truck or a train in order to be delivered; it is not going on a boat or on a plane .  Ground service is the slowest service, usually.  If you send a package from Los Ange les ground, or UPS ground, to New York it’ll probably take four days to  get there, maybe five. Sam says, “It’ll be cheaper than sending it using their o vernight service and we can still track it.”  “Overnight service” means that the pa ckage will arrive the next morning or the next afternoon, taking 24 hours or so to  get to where you are sending it.  If you have a very important letter or docum ent that someone needs by tomorrow, you would have to send it overnight.  Somet imes that’s called “express service.”  Both private companies such as UPS and Fe dEX, as well as the public mail service in the United States, the U.S. P ostal Service, all of them offer overnight service.

Sam says that they will be able to track the package, that can be done when you send something overnight or if you send it ground.  To  “track” means to know where something is, to follow something.  Nowadays, you ca n go online and you

 can put the number of the package in there and it will  tell you where that package is as it travels from your city to the place where you are sending it.  Sam asks, “Is it going to a business?”  You could send a package to a business or a house. Maria says, “Yes, it is.”  Sam says, “Okay, I’ll mark that it’ s going to a commercial address.”  To “mark” something means to write or indicat e on a form some piece of information, something that is different about th at particular thing.  For example, you could mark your house with orange balloons; you would put orange balloons to indicate – to show that it is a particular place where people would want to come for a party, for example.  I don’t know wh y you would put orange balloons on your house – maybe you’re crazy!

In any case, Sam is going to mark or indicate on the form  that it is going to a commercial address.  “Commercial” is just another word for  a business address. Maria says, “That’s fine.  I’ll also need these contracts t o get to Tokyo by Friday.” “Contracts” are legal agreements between two people.  Maria wants to send these contracts to Tokyo, Japan by Friday.  Maria says, “Send it to the home of the president of the company.”  Sam says, “I’ll send it DH L and use the residential delivery service.”  DHL is another internation al mail company that delivers packages.  “Residential” is just another word for home, so sending something to a residential address means you are sending it to a home address.

Maria says, “I’m also including a gift for the president ’s wife.”  Sam says, “If it’s breakable, I’ll pack it really well and then get it insu red.”  If the gift is “breakable” that means that it can break easily; we might also use the  word “fragile.” Sometimes if you are sending a package that has something  that could break easily, you put the word “fragile” (fragile) on the ou tside of the package.  That won’t actually make any difference, but you’ll feel bette r by doing it thinking that you’re doing something!  Sam says he’s going to pack it rea l well.  To “pack” something means to put something in a container – an e nvelope, a box – and then send it somewhere.  We also use the verb “to pack” f or other meanings in English, take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

Here, Sam is packing this gift in the package, and then h e’s going to get it insured.  To “insure” something means to have some sort of financial protection, often offered by an insurance company, so if something bad happens the company will give you money for what was lost or damaged.   Most of the private mail services have insurance that you can buy in case the packa ge gets lost or something happens to it.  Sam then asks Maria what the d eclared value is of the gift.  The “value” is what it is worth, the amount of money.  To “declare” something means to say or to state something, usually on a form or a piece of paper, something official.  So, “declared value” is the  amount of money that you are saying this is worth, and you put that down on the package so that you have

 enough insurance.  So if the package gets lost and you declared the value, you said it was worth $400, then you will get $400 back.  T hat’s what declared value is.

Maria says, “It’s about $700.”  Wow, a pretty nice gift!  Maria says, “Oh, and I want this box to go to Olten, Switzerland, but just send  it regular mail through the post office,” meaning through the public mail system.  M aria says, “Make sure I get delivery confirmation, though.”  “Delivery confirma tion” is a service where the sender can use his or her phone or the Internet to find  out exactly when the package arrived and where it was delivered, if it was del ivered to the right place. To “confirm” something means, in this case, to inform you  – to make sure that something happened.

Sam says, “No problem,” of course.  “I’ll just need to f ill out a customs declaration form.”  “Customs” is the government office that makes sure that you are not bringing something into the country that is illegal or not allowed.  A “customs declaration form” is a form – a piece of paper that sa ys this is what is in this package.  If you are sending something to another country the mail service may have to inspect what you are sending, you would put a cust oms declarations form to tell the customs office that this is what I am se nding so they know it is nothing illegal or nothing that you have to pay a tax o n.

Sam says, “What are the contents?” meaning what is inside the box or the package that she is sending to Olten, Switzerland, and M aria says, “They’re books.”  Sam says, “Okay, I’ll take care of it” – I’ll han dle it.  Maria says, “Thanks. What would I do without you?” which is a question – a n expression that people say when the person has been so helpful to them, so valuab le to them: “What would I do without you?”  Sam says, “The real question is, what would the mail services do without you?” because, of course, she’s giving th ese companies so much business by sending so many packages.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Maria:  I need this package to arrive in Tulsa by next Wed nesday.

Sam:  Sure, I’ll send it UPS or FedEx using their grou nd service.  It’ll be cheaper than sending it using their overnight service and we can st ill track it.  Is it going to a business?

What would we do without our scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse ?  I don’t know!

# Apologizing for a Bad Date

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 57: Apologizing for a Bad Date.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 457.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at eslpod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Apologizing for a Bad Date,” a b ad romantic outing or event.  This episode is a continuation of the story that w e started in ESL Podcast 455, so if you haven’t listened to 455, “Ending a Bad D ate,” you might want to listen to it to understand this one a little better.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I really blew it last night.  I finally asked my neighbor , Fatima, out on a date and she walked out on me in the middle of it.

I didn’t blame her.  I wanted to make a good impressio n on her, but I felt I was floundering a half an hour into the date.  I decided  to liven things up a bit with a few drinks.  I got carried away and got stinking drunk.  W hat an idiot!  I had to call her to apologize.

Fatima:  Hello.

Rob:  Uh, hi, Fatima.  This is Rob calling.

Fatima:  Oh.

Rob:  Please don’t hang up.  I need to apologize for my atrocious behavior last night.  I was a real jerk and I’m really, really sorry.

Fatima:  I appreciate the apology.  Thanks, but I have t o go now.

Rob:  Hold on one second, please!  I want to explain.  I thought I was boring you at the beginning of the date and that’s why I started in on the drinks.  I’m not normally a lush, really!  I was nervous and worried that things weren’t going well, and I thought a couple of drinks would loosen me up.

 Fatima:  Okay, I understand that, but that doesn’t excuse  the groping.

Rob:  Groping?  What groping?

Fatima:  You don’t remember?  You insisted on a goodn ight kiss.

Rob:  I did?  It’s all a blur.  I don’t remember anyt hing after you called me a creep.

Fatima:  You tried to kiss me and I walked out.  Can you  blame me?

Rob:  No, I can’t.  I deserved much worse.  After that, I can also understand why you’d never want to speak to me again.  Is there any way I can make it up to you?

Fatima:  I really don’t know…

Rob:  I promise not to have a drop of alcohol.

Fatima:  I’ll have to think about it.

Rob:  And I’ll have both of my hands tied behind my back the entire time.

Fatima:  Maybe.  Let me sleep on it.

At least it wasn’t a “no.”  There’s a glimmer of hope for a second chance!

[end of dialogue]

Our story continues with Rob saying, “I really blew it la st night.”  The expression “I blew it,” or “don’t blow it,” means don’t make a mistake, don’t screw it up.  If you say, “I blew it,” you’re saying I made a mistake, I di d something very poorly, very badly.  Rob says, “I finally asked my neighbor, Fatima, out on a date.”  To “ask someone out on a date” means to ask them to go on a date, often dinner, with you.  Rob asked his neighbor, Fatima, out on a dat e, “and she walked out on me in the middle of it.”  To “walk out on someone” is a phrasal verb meaning to leave someone, usually two people who are together, be cause you are angry or upset at them.  If you are having a meeting and the sal esperson walks out on the rest of you, that means that she was angry and she left t he meeting – she left you because she wasn’t happy.

 Well, Fatima was not happy about the date, and she wa lked out on Rob in the middle of the date, while they were still eating.  R ob says, “I don’t blame her (I don’t fault her).  I wanted to make a good impression on her,” he says.  To “make a good impression” is to make another person think that y ou are a good person, that you are intelligent, successful, attractive, perhaps h ave a lot money – all the things that I am not!  That’s making a good impression.  Usually you make a good impression the first time you meet someone or the f irst time you are in a certain situation.  Rob felt, however, that he was flou ndering a half an hour into the date.  So, 30 minutes after they started the date,  Rob thought he was floundering.  To “flounder” (flounder) means not to know what to do or say, or to do or say the wrong things.  Someone who is floundering  is not doing very well, making mistakes.

Rob says he’s decided to liven things up a bit with a few drinks.  To “liven (liven) something up” is a phrasal verb meaning to make something  more exciting or more interesting.  Rob thought he was boring, so he wa nted to liven things up by getting himself a few drinks.  Of course, drinking alcoh ol often changes one’s behavior, sometimes for the worse.  Rob says he got carri ed away and got stinking drunk.  To “get carried away” at doing somethin g means to do too much of something, so much so that it becomes a bad thing, ta king something to the extreme.  Everything in moderation, as the Greeks said.  T hat is, don’t have too much or too little of anything.  Rob clearly had too mu ch to drink.

He says, “What an idiot!” talking about himself.  “I had  to call her to apologize,” and then we hear a phone conversation between Rob and Fatima.  Fatima answers by saying, “Hello.”  Rob says, “Uh, hi, Fatima.  T his is Rob calling.” Fatima says, “Oh.”  Clearly, Fatima is not too excited to  talk to Rob – because, of course, he was an idiot!  Rob says, “Please don’t hang up .”  To “hang up” means to put part of the telephone back into the holder and  end a call.  More generally, it means simply to end a telephone call.  “Hang” has several  different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

Rob is asking Fatima to continue talking to him.  He says, “I need to apologize for my atrocious behavior last night.”  “Atrocious” (atrocious) means very bad, awful, terrible, something that’s really bad – it’s atrocious.   “I went to a restaurant yesterday and ordered some lasagna, and it was atrocious” – it was terrible. Really, it was!  Well, Rob had atrocious behavior.  He says he was a real “jerk,” a real idiot, and he’s really, really sorry.  Of course, whe n men make mistakes, they have to say they’re really, really, really, really, really, really sorry – and that’s what Rob is doing!

 Fatima says, “I appreciate the apology.  Thanks, but I h ave to go now,” meaning I don’t want to talk to you anymore – you idiot!  Rob sa ys, “Hold on one second, please!”  The expression “hold on one second,” or “hold o n a second,” or simply “hold on,” means that you are asking someone to wait, to  stop, not to do something, at least for short period of time.  Often w e say this when the person is trying to walk away or end a conversation.  We can also u se this expression when a person is getting angry or starting to say things that aren’t true, and you want them to listen to you now.

Rob is trying to get Fatima to continue talking to him.   He says, “Hold on one second, please!  I want to explain.”  He says he thought he was boring Fatima at the beginning of the date and that’s why he started in  on the drinks.  To “start in on” something means to begin to do something, to begi n to use something.  You may tell your daughter “It’s time for you to start in o n your homework,” meaning get going, start doing your homework you lazy daughter!   Rob says that he’s normally not a lush (lush).  A “lush” is a person who dri nks too much alcohol, a person who can’t control his or her drinking.  Rob says tha t he was nervous and he thought a couple of drinks would loosen him up.  To “loosen up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to make someone more relaxed, more friendly; more sociable, we might say.  If someone says to you, “Loosen up! ” they mean relax, don’t be so nervous.

Rob was trying to loosen up.  Fatima says, “Okay, I understa nd that, but that doesn’t excuse the groping.”  To “excuse” means to give a r eason why something happened.  Usually, when someone says, “that doe sn’t excuse this,” they mean that is not a sufficient reason – a good reaso n.  “Groping” is when you touch someone, usually with some sort of sexual intent.  I f you are a man in a subway and there’s a beautiful girl standing next to you – woman, if you try to touch her in some sexual way that would be considered gro ping.  That would also make you a creep – see podcast number 455 for a def inition!

Well, Fatima says that Rob was groping her.  Rob doesn’ t understand, Rob doesn’t remember this.  He says, “It’s all a blur.”  “Blu r” (blur) is something that is unclear, something that is difficult to see or understan d.  Rob doesn’t remember it.  Fatima explains that Rob tried to kiss her, and says, “Can you blame me (for walking out – can you blame me for leaving)?”  Rob says, “No, I can’t.  I deserved much worse” – I should have gotten something worse , perhaps a slap on the face!  Rob says, “I can also understand why you’d  never want to speak to me again.”  But Rob is trying to find a way to get ano ther date with Fatima, so he says, “Is there any way I can make it up to you?”  To “make it up to” someone means to do something nice for someone as an apology for something bad that you had done earlier.

 Fatima says, “I really don’t know…”  Rob says, “I promise n ot to have a drop of alcohol.”  A “drop” is a very small amount of something,  usually a liquid.  So, he’s saying I’m not going to drink any alcohol – except maybe a beer or two, but other than that, nothing!  Fatima says, “I’ll have to think a bout it.  Rob says, “And I’ll have both of my hands tied behind my back the entire time .”  To have your hands behind your back means, of course, you cannot do any groping  or something inappropriate.  Fatima says, “Maybe.  Let me sleep on it .”  When someone tells you they want to “sleep on” something, they mean they wan t a chance to think about it more, at least one more day and see what the y decide, to give them more time to make a decision.

Rob says, “At least it wasn’t a ‘no.’  There’s a glimmer of hope for a second chance!”  “Glimmer” is a very quick or short sight of someth ing.  Here, it means there’s a possibility that Fatima will go out on anothe r date with him.  A “glimmer of hope” means a small amount of hope, but still it’s possible.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

I really blew it last night.  I finally asked my neighbor , Fatima, out on a date and she walked out on me in the middle of it.

I don’t blame her.  I wanted to make a good impression  on her, but I felt I was floundering a half an hour into the date.  I decided  to liven things up a bit with a few drinks.  I got carried away and got stinking drunk.  W hat an idiot!  I had to call her to apologize.

Fatima:  Hello.

Rob:  Uh, hi, Fatima.  This is Rob calling.

Fatima:  Oh.

Rob:  Please don’t hang up.  I need to apologize for my atrocious behavior last night.  I was a real jerk and I’m really, really sorry.

Fatima:  I appreciate the apology.  Thanks, but I have t o go now.

Rob:  Hold on one second, please!  I want to explain.  I thought I was boring you at the beginning of the date and that’s why I started in on the drinks.  I’m not

 normally a lush, really!  I was nervous and worried that things weren’t going well, and I thought a couple of drinks would loosen me up.

Fatima:  Okay, I understand that, but that doesn’t excuse  the groping.

Rob:  Groping?  What groping?

Fatima:  You don’t remember?  You insisted on a goodn ight kiss.

Rob:  I did?  It’s all a blur.  I don’t remember anyt hing after you called me a creep.

Fatima:  You tried to kiss me and I walked out.  Can you  blame me?

Rob:  No, I can’t.  I deserved much worse.  After that, I can also understand why you’d never want to speak to me again.  Is there any way I can make it up to you?

Fatima:  I really don’t know…

Rob:  I promise not to have a drop of alcohol.

Fatima:  I’ll have to think about it.

Rob:  And I’ll have both of my hands tied behind my back the entire time.

Fatima:  Maybe.  Let me sleep on it.

At least it wasn’t a “no.”  There’s a glimmer of hope for a second chance!

# Going to the Playground

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 58: Going to the Playground.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 458.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, which will give you all of the vocabulary, defin itions, new sample sentences with the new words that we talk about, additio nal definitions, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a complete transcript  of this episode.

This episode is a story called “Going to the Playground.”  It’s going to introduce some common vocabulary you might use if you are on a pla yground, a place where kids play.  Let’s get started. > My wife was out of town on business and our nanny was sick, so  I took the day off from work to take care of our two kids: Livia, who is two, and Augustus, who is three and a half.  I thought that going to the playg round would be a good thing to do, but it turned out to be an accident waiting to ha ppen.
> When we got to the playground, the kids jumped out of the car.  Livia got onto the merry-go-round, pushing it as hard as she could.  The t rouble was, there were a couple of toddlers playing on it and they fell backwards, getting the wind knocked out of them.
> Augustus, on the other hand, ran straight for the swing  set and almost got decapitated!  Then he went over to the see-saw and almo st got smashed when he tried to run under it!  He ran out of my grasp an d onto the jungle gym.  He started hanging off the monkey bars.  I caught him just in time as he fell!
> When I turned around, I saw that Livia had got onto t he slide and slid head first into the sandbox!  Good thing she wasn’t hurt.
> By this time, I realized my mistake.  Far from a safe place  to play, for two lively kids and one father, the playground was a deathtrap!
> Our story begins with the poor father in this story – no t me, by the way – taking his son and daughter to a playground.  A “playground” is an area where children play that usually has large pieces of equipment.  You of ten find these in a public park or next to a school.

He says that “My wife was out of town on business (she was t raveling in another city) and our nanny was sick.”  A “nanny” (nanny) is a woman whose job is to take care of someone else’s children, usually when the pare nt is gone working. The nanny often lives in the home of the family, althou gh sometimes they just come over early in the morning when the mother and fat her are getting ready to leave for work.

In the story, the poor father took the day off from wo rk (to not go to work) and took care of their two children, Livia and Augustus.  He says that he thought that going to the playground would be a good thing to do,  but it turned out (it resulted that) it was an accident waiting to happen.  The expressi on “an accident waiting to happen” means that something is dangerous.  It’s a sit uation where something bad will probably happen if you wait long enough, wit h enough time – so in general, a dangerous situation.

“When we got to the playground,” he says, “the kids jump ed out of the car,” meaning they opened the doors quickly and got out of the  car.  Livia got onto the merry-go-round.  A “merry-go-round” is a large, round  piece of equipment for children to play on.  It is flat and spins around in a ci rcle.  Usually there are places for the children to stand or sit on the merry-go- round.  Merry-go-rounds can sometimes be sophisticated, with horses – not real hor ses, of course – horses that go up and down as the circle goes around and  around.  A merry-go- round is interesting for very young children, maybe three , four, five years old.

Well, in this case Livia got onto the merry-go-round and  pushed it as hard as she could – got it to move around in a circle.  Unfortunate ly, there were already a couple of “toddlers” (a couple of young children, usually one to two years old) that were sitting on the merry-go-round.  Because Livia  pushed the merry-go- round to make it spin – to make it go around in a circle , this caused the other two children to fall off of the merry-go-round (they prob ably weren’t expecting it to suddenly move), and this caused them to get the wind knocke d out of them.  To “get the wind knocked out of you” is an expression that m eans to fall down

 usually on your chest or your stomach, or having someone hit you so that you find it difficult to breathe for a short period of ti me.  Your “wind,” in this case, is the air going in and out of your lungs (that part of the body where the air goes when you breathe in).

“Augustus, on the other hand,” he says, “ran straight f or the swing set.”  To “run straight for” means to go directly to the swing set.  A “ swing set” is a large piece of equipment you would find on a playground, or even i n someone’s back yard behind their house – someone who had young children.  It usually has two or three of little seats, rectangular pieces of wood or pla stic that kids can sit on, and these seats are connected to a pole that is above them so that they can swing – they can go back and forth in the air.  We used to have o ne of these in my house – in the back yard in the house where I grew up.  They w ere very popular, and still are.  Swing sets, however, can be a little dangero us because if you swing too high it’s possible for you to fall off.

Augustus apparently was swinging a little bit too much a nd almost got decapitated.  “Decapitated” means without your head, li terally when someone cuts your head off from the rest of your body – separates your head from the rest of your body.  During the French Revolution there was som ething called, in English, the guillotine, which was a large blade like a  large knife that cut people’s heads off who were enemies of the government.  This is a  way of decapitating someone.  I don’t recommend it, personally!

Getting back to Augustus, he then went over to the see-sa w.  A “see-saw” (see- saw) is a long piece of wood – a rectangular piece of wo od, or sometimes metal, that has seats on both ends, and in the middle there is something that holds up the wood or the piece of metal.  When one child goes u p the other child goes down, and they go back and forth going up and down.  I n the center is something that is holding up this piece of wood; technically, it i s what we would call a “fulcrum” (fulcrum).  Once again, the see-saw would be a popular toy – a popular piece of equipment for a young child.  Unfortunately, t he young son of the narrator of our story, Augustus, almost got smashed when  he tried to run under the see-saw.  One is guessing that there was somebody alr eady on the see-saw who was coming down, and Augustus was running underneath  the see-saw. When we say he almost got “smashed,” we mean that he al most got hurt – he almost got hit.  To “smash” usually means to apply force fr om the top down, something very heavy.  You could take a hammer, for exampl e, and smash a plate.  I don’t know why you would do this, maybe you’re  angry!  Sometimes it’s

 useful to hit something when you’re angry, as long as yo u don’t hit another person.

In this case, poor Augustus almost got smashed – almost got  hit when he tried to run under a see-saw.  “Augustus ran out of my grasp,” the poor father says, “and onto the jungle gym.”  To be “out of your grasp” (gr asp) means to be away from your hands – to be too far for you to hold or to touch.   We can also use this in a more metaphorical sense, you can say that becoming preside nt of the company is out of my grasp – it’s too far away from me, I can’t r each it, I can’t obtain it. The word “grasp” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Augustus runs out of his father’s grasp and onto a jungl e gym.  A “jungle gym” is a large, tall piece of equipment that has many differe nt metal bars separated by open spaces so that children can climb on them.  It’s anot her large piece of equipment that you would find in a park on a playgrou nd.  Part of the jungle gym has what we would call “monkey bars.”  “Monkey bars” are so rt of like a ladder that is horizontal instead of vertical.  Normally, if yo u want to climb up to the top of your house or to a top of a building you might use a  ladder, which has pieces of metal every couple of feet or every foot that are ba sically steps that you can climb up to go straight up.  Monkey bars consist of a ladd er that is horizontal instead of vertical, and you grab onto each metal bar an d you try to move forward.  If you’ve seen a movie about the army – the ar med forces training, this is a very common way of training soldiers when you have these  monkey bars, essentially.  We don’t call them monkey bars in the army, I would guess, but that’s what they’re called on a playground.  It’s basicall y a horizontal ladder that you have high above the ground, and you grab one bar a nd move forward with your arms.

In this case, Augustus got up to the monkey bars and almost fell off of them, hitting the ground.  He did fall off, but his father  was there to catch him.  When the father turns around he sees that Livia has gone onto  the slide.  A “slide” on a playground is a long, flat, narrow piece of metal that  is placed at an angle so that children can go down it.  So you have a ladder that goe s to the top of the slide, and the children get on the slide and they go all the  way down to the bottom.  In fact, we would use the verb “to slide” – “They slide dow n to the bottom of the slide” (used as a noun).  “Slide” has a couple of differ ent meanings in English, however, so take a look at the Learning Guide to underst and this word a little better.

 Unfortunately, Livia is going down the slide head first.   When we say someone goes down “head first” we mean that their head is movin g in front of their feet, especially if you are sliding down something.  It is dange rous if you are going down with your head as the first thing that would hit the ground; you want your feet to be the first thing that hits the ground.  So , the opposite of head first would be feet first.  Livia slides into a sandbox.  A “sandbo x” is a large, open, rectangular box that is filled with sand, very small piece s of earth that you usually find on a beach.  Very young children often like to play in these sandboxes. Fortunately for Livia, because the slide went into a sand box, the sand was able to protect her from hurting herself too much.

The father says at the end of the story, “By this time, I  realized my mistake.”  He thought the playground was a safe place to play, which is why he says, “Far from a safe place to play (meaning that’s not true, it’s not a safe place to play), it’s not a safe place for two lively kids and one father.”  “Lively”  means very active, with lots of energy.  Instead, he says, “the playground was a d eathtrap!”  A “deathtrap” is a very dangerous thing or dangerous plac e where you can get killed very easily.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal spe ed.

[start of story]

My wife was out of town on business and our nanny was sick, so  I took the day off from work to take care of our two kids: Livia, who is two, and Augustus, who is three and a half.  I thought that going to the playg round would be a good thing to do, but it turned out to be an accident waiting to ha ppen.

When we got to the playground, the kids jumped out of the car.  Livia got onto the merry-go-round, pushing it as hard as she could.  The t rouble was, there were a couple of toddlers playing on it and they fell backwards, getting the wind knocked out of them.

Augustus, on the other hand, ran straight for the swing  set and almost got decapitated!  Then he went over to the see-saw and almo st got smashed when he tried to run under it!  He ran out of my grasp an d onto the jungle gym.  He started hanging off the monkey bars.  I caught him just in time as he fell!

When I turned around, I saw that Livia had got onto t he slide and slid head first into the sandbox!  Good thing she wasn’t hurt.

 By this time, I realized my mistake.  Far from a safe place  to play, for two lively kids and one father, the playground was a deathtrap!

# Watching Political Commentary Shows

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 59: Watching Political Commentary Shows.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 459.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide, an 8- to 10- page guide we provide for this episode and all of our  current episodes that will help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Watching Political Commentary Show s.”  These are news programs where there are people giving their opinions about politics – about things going on in the country, in the government.  The y’re very popular in the United States, especially in last 20 years they have become popular.  We’re going to listen to a dialogue between Laura and Joon that uses some common vocabulary you might hear or see used on one of these tel evision shows.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Laura:  I really don’t like these political commentary sh ows.  They purportedly present both sides of an issue, but the commentator is al ways biased.

Joon:  Oh, I don’t think so.  Each show invites pundits on each side of the political spectrum.  In this show, for instance, the pundi ts each take turns presenting their arguments.

Laura:  You mean they each present the party line, rig ht?  I find it so predictable what each side will say, since they always invite people who have opinions that are poles apart.

Joon:  That’s not always true.  This other show has a roun dtable format.  Each person listens to the others and they debate the issues.

Laura:  On that show, it’s not what they say, but how th ey say it.  They treat the others’ opinions with such contempt.  You can hear the l oathing in their voices and they constantly talk over each other.  I’m surprised you can bear to watch it.

 Joon:  I find it stimulating.  I like a good fight.

Laura:  I guess it’s better for them to do it on screen  than on the streets!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Laura saying, “I don’t really like these political commentary shows.”  “Political” means relating to politi cs, what the government does – their policies, their actions.  “Commentary” mean s giving your opinion, or your view about something.  Laura says that these political  commentary shows purportedly present both sides of an issue, but the comm entator is always biased.  “Purportedly” means supposedly; it’s what someone says they are doing, but it usually isn’t true.  You could say, “She went int o his room purportedly to put away some clothes, but he thinks that she was looking for so mething.”  She said she was going in there to put away some clothes, but she w as really doing something else.

These shows purportedly present, or give you both sides of an issue – give you different viewpoints about an issue, but the commentato r is always biased.  A “commentator” is a person who gives his or her opinion, u sually someone who is paid to give their opinion.  They can be either politi cally liberal (on the left), or politically conservative (on the right), or somewhere in between.  When we say someone is “biased,” we mean that they have a strong opin ion for or against something, so that you can’t really see anything but your o pinion.  Someone who is biased is usually someone who is not objective, someone wh o can’t look at the facts and determine something because they have their own strong opinions that already influence their views.

Joon says, “Oh, I don’t think so (I don’t think the comme ntators are always biased).  Each show invites pundits on each side of the pol itical spectrum.”  A “pundit” (pundit) is a person who gives his or her opin ions about something, usually on a radio program or on a television show.  Th ere are several cable news networks that have political pundits, people giving t heir opinions on shows, and you can find lots and lots of these shows about Ame rican politics on American television.  The “political spectrum” is the rang e of opinions, from liberal on the left, to conservative that is on the righ t.  That’s the spectrum; it’s the range of different opinions.  Joon says, “In this show, t he pundits each take turns presenting their arguments.”  To “take turns” means tha t each person has an opportunity, they go from one to the other, then back t o the first, and then back to

 the second, and so forth.  “Arguments,” here, means rea sons why you believe something.  The word “argument,” however, has a couple of different meanings in English; go to the Learning Guide for some additio nal explanations.

Laura says, “You mean they each present the party line, r ight?”  The “party line” here means the official opinion or the generally accepte d ideas of a certain group.  Usually when we are talking about a political party people will use this term, the party line.  It also has the implication of being someone who doesn’t think for themselves, just repeats the opinions of the g roup that they belong to. But in any case, party line has to do with the accepted po sitions about certain things, opinions that a certain group has about, often , political issues.  Laura says, “I find it so predictable what each side will say.”  When you say something is “predictable,” you mean you know what is going to ha ppen, you already know their opinion before they tell you – you can predict it.   She says, “they always invite people who have opinions that are poles apart.”  The expression “poles apart” here means very different from one another.  S omeone very conservative and someone very liberal would be poles apart.

Joon says, “That’s not always true.  This other show has a ro undtable format.”  A “roundtable” (one word) is a type of meeting or discussio n where people sit around a table and each person talks for a short amount time.  It’s more like a conversation.  Joon says in this roundtable, each person liste ns to the others and they debate the issues.  To “debate” means to talk about  what you think and the reasons why you think that.

Laura says, “On that show, it’s not what they say, it’s ho w they say it.  They treat the others’ opinions with such contempt.”  “Contempt” i s a feeling that someone or something isn’t important and you do not need to re spect it.  It’s a feeling of disgust, we would say.  If someone says, “She was treated w ith contempt,” they mean that the other persons didn’t respect her and they treated her badly.  Laura says that you can hear the loathing in their voices and the y constantly talk over each other.  To “loathe” (loathe) means to hate, to r eally dislike something, not to like something.  “Loathing” means hatred of something,  not liking something. She says, “You can hear the loathing (the dislike, their hatred) in their voices and they constantly talk over each other.”  To “talk over (someo ne)” means to speak loudly before the other person is finished talking.  Yo u’re trying to basically stop the other person from talking by speaking loudly so that t hey will listen to you, or someone else will listen to you.  This is very common on t hese political commentary shows; people are almost shouting or yelling at  each other about some political topic.

 Laura says, “I’m surprised you can bear to watch it.”  T o “bear to watch it” means that you are able to watch it because it is so difficult; it is so painful, perhaps. Joon says, “I find it stimulating.”  Something that is “st imulating” is something that is exciting, something that is interesting, something tha t makes you think about a topic in a new or different way.  Joon says, “I like a goo d fight,” when two people are arguing or disagreeing with each other.  Laura says,  “I guess it’s better for them to do it on screen than on the streets!”  So she ’s saying I guess it’s better for them to fight each other on the television.  The e xpression “on screen” means either on your television or on a movie screen – a place where you watch movies.  It’s better for them to do it on TV then to f ight in the streets.  The idea here is that if you fight in the streets it’s often a ph ysical fight, where you’re punching and hitting the other person.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Laura:  I really don’t like these political commentary sh ows.  They purportedly present both sides of an issue, but the commentator is al ways biased.

Joon:  Oh, I don’t think so.  Each show invites pundits on each side of the political spectrum.  In this show, for instance, the pundi ts each take turns presenting their arguments.

Laura:  You mean they each present the party line, rig ht?  I find it so predictable what each side will say, since they always invite people who have opinions that are poles apart.

# Working in a Bad Economy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 60: Working in a Bad Economy.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 460.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Working in a Bad Economy.”  It’s a dialogue that is going to use a lot of vocabulary in talking about, well, a bad  economy, when people are losing their jobs and companies are not make a lot of m oney.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Shivon:  This bad economy is really taking its toll.

Lex:  Tell me about it!  My company has already laid off 20% of its workforce, and now the management is talking about cutting salaries.  I t goes without saying that there won’t be any bonuses this year.

Shivon:  What are you complaining about?  At least you st ill have a job.  Try working as a freelancer.  I’ve had to cut my hourly rate t o compete with all of the people flooding the job market.

Lex:  At least you’re still able to pick and choose your clie nts.  I have to do what my bosses tell me, no matter what.  If they say I have to w ork overtime, that’s what I have to do.  I don’t even get compensated for it !  You can bill by the hour.

Shivon:  What’s the good of billing by the hour if I d on’t have any clients?  You don’t know how good you have it.  I don’t want to hea r another word until you walk a mile in my shoes!

Lex:  Ditto!

[end of dialogue]

 Shivon begins our dialogue by telling Lex, “This bad econ omy is really taking its toll.”  “Economy” refers, in general, to the financial system where things are bought and sold in any country or area.  “Economy” actuall y has a couple of different meanings in English however, so take a look a t that Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  “To take its toll on (some thing)” means to have a negative effect or a bad influence on something, to mak e something more difficult.  So, Shivon says this bad economy is taking its to ll, meaning it’s causing damage to people, to companies, and so forth.

Lex says, “Tell me about it!”  This expression doesn’t mean what it says; it doesn’t mean that the person is asking you to tell you some thing.  It’s an expression we use to mean yes, I know.  You’re agreeing w ith someone and saying that you also know the same thing.  Lex says, “My compan y has already laid off 20% of its workforce.”  To “lay off (someone)” means to take away someone’s job.  So, if John has been laid off, that mea ns he’s been fired – he lost his job.  Often we use this phrasal verb to talk abo ut someone who loses their job because of a bad economy, not because they did a  bad job. “Workforce” is just another word for the group of peop le who work in a particular industry, a particular kind of business, or even in a part icular country.  The American workforce refers to everyone who works in the Unit ed States.

Lex says that the management is talking about cutting salar ies.  “Salary” is the amount of money you receive for your work.  There’s anothe r word, also, called “wages” (wages), which can mean the same thing, althoug h usually when we say “wages,” we’re talking about someone who works by the hou r, who makes so many dollars each hour.  If you are paid regardless of ho w many hours you work (meaning it doesn’t matter if you work more hours, you still get the same pay) that’s called a salary.  Lex says, “It goes without saying th at there won’t be any bonuses this year.”  If you say “it goes without saying,” you ’re saying that what you are about to say is very obvious.  Another way to say this would be, simply, “obviously.”  Obviously – it goes without saying that there won’t be any bonuses this year.  A “bonus” is money that you receive from you r company (the place you work for), usually at the end of the year.  If the compa ny has done very well, sometimes they’ll give of all of their employees more mon ey.  Or, if you have done a particularly good job you might get this as an e xtra gift.

Shivon says, “What are you complaining about?  At least you  still have a job.  Try working as a freelancer.”  A “freelancer” is somebody who works for, perhaps, many different companies.  The technical term we might u se is “independent contractor,” someone who works for different companies but  is not an employee – a full-time employee of any of them.  Shivon says, “I h ad to cut my hourly rate

 to compete with all of the people flooding the job m arket.”  Your “hourly rate” is the amount of money that you get per one hour of work.   Freelancers or independent contractors sometimes are paid by the hour, t hat is, for each hour that they say they worked.  Sometimes, freelancers are pai d “by the job,” meaning here are the things you have to do, and we’l l pay you so much money for finishing them.  When Shivon says “people are flood ing the job market,” she means that they are more and more people suddenly doing the same kind of work that she is.  To “flood” something to suddenly add a  large number of that thing: “We were flooded with emails last week.”  That  means that suddenly we receive lots and lots of emails.  The “job market” is the  people who are looking for jobs.  It’s a general description of hiring and looking to hire, that process, that group of people – the companies and the people looking  for work is called the job market.  If the economy is bad, then the job market is bad; there aren’t a lot of jobs, or there aren’t many jobs that pay well.

Lex says, “At least you’re still able to pick and choose your clients.”  To “pick and choose” means to have many options, to be able to select on ly the ones you really want to do or want to work with, in this case.  Lex says, “I have to do what my bosses tell me, no matter what.  If they say I have to w ork overtime, that’s what I have to do.”  “Overtime” (one word) means worki ng more than your normal hours.  Americans typically work 40 hours per week.  But i f you work 50, 60, maybe even 70 hours, that would be called overtime.  Le x says, “I don’t even get compensated for it!”  To “compensate” means to pays somebo dy for their work. So, Lex is saying that he doesn’t get any extra money even t hough he works more hours than he used to.  “Compensate” has a couple of different meanings in English, however, so be sure to look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lex says, “You can bill by the hour,” meaning you, Shivon,  can bill by the hour. To “bill” means to tell somebody how much they need to  pay you, to send them a piece of paper that says you must pay me this amount of mo ney because I did this work for you.  “By the hour” just means each hour.  M any freelancers – independent contractors – will bill by the hour.  Depen ding on how many hours they work, that’s how much you have to pay them.

Shivon says, “What’s the good of billing by the hour if I  don’t have any clients (any customers)?”  She’s saying yes, I can bill by the hour,  but if you don’t have anyone to bill – you don’t have any jobs – then it doe sn’t matter.  Shivon says, “You don’t know how good you have it.”  If someone says, “You don’t know how good you have it,” they mean don’t understand or you don ’t realize what a good situation you have compared to me, or compared to someone  else.  Some

 people say that to someone who is complaining a lot, wh o’s saying, “Oh, my job is terrible.  My life is miserable.  My girlfriend doesn ’t love me,” someone else may say, “You don’t know how good you have it.  At least yo u have a job.  At least you have a girlfriend.”  Well, maybe not the gi rlfriend, but at least you have a job!

Shivon says, “I don’t want to hear another word until yo u walk a mile in my shoes!”  The expression “to walk a mile in (someone’s) sho es” means to experience the same thing that someone else is experiencin g, to live someone else’s life, to have their experiences.  So Shivon is sayin g that you don’t understand me, my experiences, so I don’t want to hear yo u complain until you have had the same experiences  – difficult experiences, in this case – as I have.

Lex says, “Ditto!”  “Ditto” (ditto) is an informal term we use to say that you agree with someone completely, what someone just said.  It’s al so if you want to repeat exactly what someone else has said.  So, let’s say a mother  is talking to her two daughters and she asks the first daughter, “Where were yo u tonight?” and the first daughter says, “I was with Julie.”  Then she asks the second daughter, “Where were you tonight?” and the second daughter says,  “Ditto” meaning I was with Julie, too.  Here, Lex is saying that he is in agree ment with Shivon in that he doesn’t want to hear her complaining until she has exper ienced what he has.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Shivon:  This bad economy is really taking its toll.

Lex:  Tell me about it!  My company has already laid off 20% of its workforce, and now the management is talking about cutting salaries.  I t goes without saying that there won’t be any bonuses this year.

Shivon:  What are you complaining about?  At least you st ill have a job.  Try working as a freelancer.  I’ve had to cut my hourly rate t o compete with all of the people flooding the job market.

Lex:  At least you’re still able to pick and choose your clie nts.  I have to do what my bosses tell me, no matter what.  If they say I have to w ork overtime, that’s what I have to do.  I don’t even get compensated for it !  You can bill by the hour.

 Shivon:  What’s the good of billing by the hour if I d on’t have any clients?  You don’t know how good you have it.  I don’t want to hea r another word until you walk a mile in my shoes!

Lex:  Ditto!

[end of dialogue]

It goes without saying that the script for this episode wa s written by the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.

# Using a Guidebook

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 61: Using a Guidebook.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 461.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, in the golden State  of California.

We invite you to visit our website at eslpod.com and downl oad a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page guide that will h elp you improve your English even faster.

This episode is about using a “guidebook,” which is a specia l book for “tourists,” people visiting another city or another country, that tel ls him about that country: where they should eat, where they can sleep, where they  can stay, and so forth. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nicki:  Wow, did you buy out the bookstore?!

Tony:  Very funny.  I just got a few guidebooks for our trip to Vancouver.  I want to study up on what the must-see sights are, and then deci de whether we can do some self-guided tours or need to book guided tours.

Nicki:  That’s very conscientious of you.  The trip isn’t for three months.

Tony:  I know, but I want to start sketching out an itin erary now.  I’m going to start out by reading the orientation chapters so I get a feel  for the city.

Nicki:  Good, then at least one of us will know where t o go and what to do.

Tony:  After that, I’m going to read the helpful hin ts in the accommodations section.  I want to make sure we stay in the heart of the  city with plenty of nightlife.  I’ll read the section on day trips, too, in  case we have some extra time.

Nicki:  It sounds like you’ve got it covered.

Tony:  I do.  I also want to spend some time learning so me survival phrases so I can talk to the locals.

 Nicki:  Survival phrases?  To visit Vancouver?

Tony:  Yeah, we won’t be able to get around without learning some French, you know.

Nicki:  Really?  Hmm.  I think you’d better keep reading.

[end of dialogue]

Nicki begins the dialogue by saying, “Wow, did you buy out  the bookstore?!”  To “buy out” means to buy everything in a store.  For exampl e, if you really like chocolate and you go to the grocery store and you buy all of the chocolate they sell – everything, that would be to buy out the store.  Nicki is asking Tony if he bought out the bookstore because, apparently, Tony has a  lot of books.

Tony says, “Very funny,” which means I don’t think you’re ve ry funny.  When someone says something to you making a joke and you don’t like the joke, you can say, “very funny,” but you have to say it in a way that s hows that you don’t think it’s very funny.  Tony says, “I just got a few guideboo ks for our trip to Vancouver,” he says, “I want to study up on what the must- see sights are.”  To “study up on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to s pend a lot of time learning about something, usually by reading.  Someone  might say, “I’m going to study up on Greek philosophy.”  I’m going to read Greek philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, in order to know more about them.  That’s “ to study up on.”  You can also say, “to read up on.”

Tony is studying up on the must-see sites in Vancouver, which  is a city in western Canada.  If someone says, “this is must-see,” they me an it is highly recommended, it is something that you really ought to – you really should see. Here in the U.S., one of the television networks had a  slogan – had an advertising expression “must-see TV,” meaning these were sho ws that everyone had to watch because they were so popular.  “Sights” (si ghts) here means interesting or famous things that people would want to  visit.  Here in Los Angeles, for example, some of the must-see sights would be Hollywood Boulevard, the Santa Monica Pier and Beach, probably the Getty Museum, and the Hollywood Sign, which is famous as a symbol of Hollywo od.

Tony says he wants to decide whether he and Nicki can do some  self-guided tours or if they need to book guided tours.  “Self-guid ed tours” are tours (visits; trips to somewhere) where you’re not with anyone who’s a professional tour

 guide, you’re just using, typically, a book that tells you a bout things.  The word “self” added to the beginning of another word usually means by yourself, without anyone else’s help.  Someone could say they are “self-taugh t,” meaning they didn’t have a teacher, they taught themselves.  So, self-g uided tours are tours that you go on by yourself.  If you want someone to help  you, to go with you, that would be a guided tour.

Nicki says, “That’s very conscientious of you.”  “Conscientious” me ans very careful, paying attention to all the little details, d oing everything you’re supposed to do.  If you say, “she’s a conscientious worker,” you mea n she does all of her work, she’s very careful.  I am not very conscientious!

Nicki says, “The trip isn’t for three months,” meaning we aren’t going to go on this trip for three more months.  Tony says, “I know, but I wa nted to start sketching out an itinerary now.”  To “sketch out” is a two-word ph rasal verb meaning to write down some ideas, what we might call “rough idea s.”  You’re not exactly sure but you want, at least, to have a beginning plan .  “Itinerary” is the schedule for your trip: what you’re going to do on the first da y, the second day, the third day, and so forth.  Tony says, “I’m going to start out (I’ m going to begin) by reading the orientation chapters so I get a feel for t he city.”  An “orientation” is an overview, something that gives you general knowledge abo ut a thing or a place before you actually begin it, or in this case, before you  actually go there.

Tony is going to read the orientation chapters of the book so he can get a feel for the city.  “To get a feel for (something)” means to beco me familiar with something, to understand it very well.  Nicki says, “Good, then at least one of us will know where to go and what to do.”  Tony says, “Afte r that (after he finishes reading the orientation chapters), I’m going to read the helpful hints in the accommodations section.”  Guidebooks normally have lots of in formation about different things you can do in a city or a place.  A “hin t” is additional or useful information or suggestion, so “helpful hints” are usefu l ideas, useful suggestions. “Accommodations” refers to places where you sleep overnight : hotels, for example.

Tony says, “I want to make sure we stay in the heart of the city with plenty of nightlife.”  The “heart of the city” is the main busine ss and entertainment area of the city – the center of the city.  In many cities, that’s the downtown.  In New York City, Manhattan is the heart of the city; it’s the major , main area in the city. People often complain that Los Angeles is a city that do esn’t really have a heart. That is, there isn’t one center place where thing happe ns.  Tony says that he’s looking for someplace with lots of nightlife.  “Night life” is entertainment that

 happens in the evening, at night.  It usually refers to bars, restaurants, dance clubs, concert halls – places where people would go to enj oy themselves at night.

Tony says, “I’ll read the section on day trips, too, in case  we have some extra time.”  A “day trip” is when you go to, say, a large cit y such as Los Angeles, and then you want to visit a smaller city close to there, but yo u don’t want to stay overnight.  You’re just going to go in the morning an d come back in the afternoon or evening.  So if you come to L.A., you might want to  take a day trip to Santa Barbara, which is about two hours north of the city; or  San Diego, which is two hours south of the city; or Palm Springs, which is two h ours east of the city. These would be day trips from Los Angeles.

Nicki says, “It sounds like you’ve got it covered.”  If someone  says they’ve “got it covered,” they mean they are able to do something, they a re in control of the situation, they are prepared.  Tony is very prepared; Ton y says, “I do.  I also want to spend some time learning some survival phrases so I can talk to the locals.” “Survival phrases” are basic expressions that you might learn when you are visiting a country that uses a language you don’t speak very w ell.  So, if I were to go to Japan, I would have to learn things like “Where i s the bathroom?”  “How much does this cost?”  Those would be survival phrases.  Whe n Tony says he wants to be able to talk to the “locals,” he means he wa nts to talk to the people who live in the city – people who are not tourists, peo ple who are permanent residents, people who live all year round in the particu lar area.  “Local” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Nicki says, “Survival phrases?  To visit Vancouver?”  Tony says, “Y eah, we won’t be able to get around without learning some French, yo u know.”  But, of course, this isn’t true.  Vancouver is in the western part of Can ada, and although there are people who speak French there, it is mostly an Engli sh-speaking city.  Nicki says, “Really?  Hmm.  I think you’d better keep reading,” meaning you obviously don’t know very much about Vancouver if you think you have t o learn French to visit there.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Nicki:  Wow, did you buy out the bookstore?!

 Tony:  Very funny.  I just got a few guidebooks for our trip to Vancouver.  I want to study up on what the must-see sights are, and then deci de whether we can do some self-guided tours or need to book guided tours.

# Having Doubts About Getting Married

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 462: Having Doubts About Getting Married.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 462.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page PDF guide that gives you a complete transcript of this episode, as well as additional help in vocabulary, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a lot more.  This episode is called “Having Doubts About Getting Married.”  It’s a dialogue between Charlotte and Chris, which uses a lot of vocabulary that you might use in talking about someone getting married and someone who isn’t sure they should get married.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Charlotte:  What are you doing in here?  The entire wedding party is looking for you.  Chris:  Yeah, I know.  Charlotte:  Well, what’s the matter?  You’re not getting cold feet, are you?  Chris:  That’s just it.  I’m really having doubts about getting married.  What am I doing here?  I think I’m about to make the biggest mistake of my life!  Charlotte:  Whoa, slow down.  You’re just a little freaked out right now.  That’s understandable.  Just don’t do anything rash.  Chris:  I have an irresistible impulse to run.  I’ve got to get out of here!  Charlotte:  You’d better do some serious soul-searching before you decide to leave Kerry at the altar.  It would be a life-altering experience for her and for you.  She may never get over it.  Chris:  You’re right, but what can I do?  If I go through with this, I may regret it for the rest of my life. # Washing the Car

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 463: Washing the Car.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 463.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  You probably know that, you probably also know you can download a Learning Guide for this episode on our website to help you improve your English even faster.  This episode is called “Washing the Car.”  It’s a story about what happened when I went to get my car washed, and of course, it will use a lot of vocabulary that is related to washing your car.  Let’s get started.  > I was driving down the road when I saw a group of teenagers holding up signs for a fundraising car wash for their school.  My car was very dirty, so I pulled over and paid for a car wash and a wax.  I think that the students had more enthusiasm than car washing skills.  Yes, they had hoses, buckets filled with soapy water, and sponges, but they seemed more interested in getting each other wet than in getting the dirt off the car.  I kept wanting to jump up and say, “Hey, you missed a spot!” but I didn’t.    After washing the car, they rinsed it and dried it with towels.  They also vacuumed the interior and washed the windows.  At least the windows were spotless.  Finally, they waxed and polished the car, and were finished.    I went over to inspect the washed car.  All I can say is I’m glad this was a fundraiser to support their school.  If these students do as well in their classes as they did on my car, they need all the education they can get!
  This is an interesting story for me because I actually worked at a car wash when I was 15 years old; it was my very first paying job.  I worked washing cars and drying them with towels.  It was maybe one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had, but # Talking About Inventory

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 464: Talking About Inventory.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 464.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there; take a look at our new courses that we have.  These are additional courses in business and daily English I think you may be interested in, including our Introduction to the United States.  You can also download a Learning Guide for this episode which will help you improve your English even faster.  This episode is called “Talking About Inventory.”  “Inventory” is what you sell – what a company sells; it can also mean a list of something in a particular place, including the things that a company sells.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Foreman:  Okay, people.  Listen up.    This is your first day on the job in this warehouse and you need to know what we do here.  This warehouse keeps all of the stock for the 10 stores in this region.  We get merchandise from the supplier and it’s our job to organize it and store it until it goes to the retail outlets.  One of the reasons our stores can offer such low prices is that they operate on the principles of economies of scale.  This means that we buy in bulk and there’s a lot to catalogue and store.  We even have some stock on consignment, so it’s all the more important that we’re able to keep track of any merchandise that comes through here.  Any questions?  Carla:  Yeah, are we the end of the supply chain or do we send merchandise to other warehouses?  Foreman:  We are it.  Merchandise comes to us from suppliers and we distribute it to the stores.  Any other questions?  Carla:  Does merchandise ever go missing? # Describing Boring and Exciting Things

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 465: Describing Boring and Exciting Things.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 465.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even faster.  This episode is called “Describing Boring and Exciting Things.”  It’s a dialogue between Ina and Paco who go to see different movies and describe them as being exciting or boring.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Ina:  It was a great idea to split up to go see different movies.  I really liked The McQuillanator!  Paco:  I’m glad to hear it.  You made a better choice than I did.  The biopic I saw was mind-numbing.  I was bored to death!  Ina:  Really?  My movie was great.  It was action-packed and fast-paced.  I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.  Paco:  I wish I had been.  My movie moved at a snail’s pace and what was supposed to be dramatic was just repetitive.  I can’t believe I sat through that entire thing.  I’m sure I nodded off more than once.  Ina:  That’s too bad.  You should have abandoned your theater and joined me in mine.  I’m still feeling the adrenaline rush.  Paco:  Yeah, but instead I got a good nap.  What a waste of money!  Ina:  Just consider it a good lesson learned.  Paco:  What lesson?  Ina:  Let me pick the movies.  I know a good bang for the buck! # Having a Good or Bad Bedside Manner

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 66: Having a Good or Bad Bedside Manner.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 466.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

The Learning Guide contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is about bedside manner.  It’s going to be a conversation about doctors, and it will use a lot of vocabulary that doctors might use when you go to visit them.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cho:  I’m not sure I’m cut out to be a doctor.

Joy:  I think you’ll be great.  I’ve seen you with patient s and you have a great bedside manner – not like Gregory.

Cho:  Why?  What’s wrong with his bedside manner?

Joy:  I’ve seen him with patients and he can be really cal lous.  For instance, I was in the room last week when he was telling one of hi s patients that she was taking a turn for the worse.

Cho:  What did he say?

Joy:  He just blurted it out.  He told her the diagnosi s, and he didn’t even try to soften the news when she asked about her prognosis.  He di d absolutely nothing to try to comfort or reassure her.

Cho:  I feel sorry for the patient.

Joy:  That’s the point.  Gregory didn’t, and it didn’t  seem to faze him that the patient was very upset and close to hysterics.

 Cho:  That’s terrible.  I’ll try to remember to be m ore compassionate with my patients.

Joy:  Don’t worry.  It’s against your nature to be anythin g but considerate.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Cho saying to Joy, “I’m not sur e I’m cut out to be a doctor.”  To be “cut out” means to be created to do som ething, something that is a good match for you, something that is intended for yo u.  Someone might say, if you like to write and to ask people questions, you may be cu t out to be a journalist (a reporter – someone who works at a newspape r).  More often you’ll hear this expression in the negative: “He’s not cut out for that kind of work” – he is not made for that kind of work, he doesn’t have the talent for that kind of work.

Cho is a doctor, and says that he’s not cut out to be a do ctor.  Joy says, “I think you’ll be great.  I’ve seen you with patients and you ha ve great bedside manner.” “Patients” are people who are receiving medical care or  attention from a doctor or a nurse.  If you’re sick, you go in to see a doctor, you are  a patient.  “Bedside manner” refers to the way that a doctor or a nurse talks to people, how they give medical advice or instructions or other information.  It’ s a general term to refer to how doctors treat their patients – how they communicate  with their patients, because that’s such an important part of medicine.

Joy says that Cho has great bedside manner – not like Grego ry.  Cho says, “Why?  What’s wrong with his bedside manner?”  Joy says, “I ’ve seen him with patients and he can be really callous.”  “Callous” (callou s) means without considering another person’s feelings, somewhat mean, not  being considerate of someone else, not thinking about the feelings of someone  else.  “Callous,” like the expression “cut out,” has a couple of different meani ngs in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explan ations.  Joy says, “For instance (for example), I was in the room last week when he was telling one of his patients that she was taking a turn for the worse.”  The expression “to take a turn for the worse” means to be getting worse, to worse n; it’s the opposite of “getting better,” especially when you are talking about someone’s health.  If you say, “She’s taken a turn for the worse,” you mean she has b ecome sicker, she has become more ill.

Cho says, “What did he say?” meaning what did he say to t his patient about taking a turn for the worse.  Joy says, “He just blurted it out.”  To “blurt (blurt) something out” is a phrasal verb meaning to say something  without thinking

 about it first, without thinking about how it will so und to the other person or how that other person may react; it can be a good thing or a bad thing.  In this case, it clearly was a bad thing because this other doctor, Gregor y, told his patient the diagnosis and didn’t even try to soften the news when she  asked about her prognosis.  A “diagnosis” is the doctor’s conclusion about wh at the medical problem is; it’s the doctor’s idea about what the probl em with your health is.  “To soften (something)” here means to make it nicer, to make it easier to accept.  So “to soften the news” means to tell someone something in such a way that it doesn’t upset them.  We have an expression: “to soften t he blow” (blow).  “Blow” here means a punch or a hit.  So if someone is going to  give you bad news, they will try to soften the blow – to soften the news.  Wome n sometimes do this to men who ask them out on a date.  They’ll say, “Oh, I’m busy on Friday,” and the man says, “What about Saturday?”  “Oh, I’m busy on Saturd ay, too.”  If the man is intelligent, he’ll understand that she’s trying to sof ten the blow, instead of just saying, “No, you’re ugly!” for example.  A “prognosis” (p rognosis) is the doctor’s opinion about how your health will change in the futu re.  So, “diagnosis” is what the doctor thinks is what is wrong with you; “prognosis” is what the doctor thinks the future will be for you.  If you have a good progno sis, that means you will be healthy, or least live for a long time.

This doctor, however, did not try to soften the news abo ut her prognosis; Joy says, “He did absolutely nothing to try to comfort or reassu re her.”  “To comfort” someone means to do or say something that will make the person feel better, make the person feel more comfortable.  “To reassure” so meone means to make them feel better about something; it’s similar to “comf ort,” make them feel less worried about something or more confident about somet hing.  We have an expression: “Let me reassure you, there is nothing wrong w ith the American banking system.”  The idea is that we are giving you confid ence that everything is okay.

Cho says to Joy, “I feel sorry for the patient.”  “To feel  sorry for (someone)” is to understand the person’s difficulty, to empathize with so meone.  Joy says, “That’s the point.  Gregory didn’t (meaning Gregory didn’t fe el sorry for his patient), and it didn’t seem to faze him that the patient was very upset  and close to hysterics.” The expression “didn’t seem to faze (faze) (someone)” is a phrase that means that you are surprised because someone else wasn’t affected  by something or didn’t have a strong reaction to something.  So, going  back to our previous example: the man asks a woman out on a date, the woman says, “No, you’re ugly,” because she doesn’t try to soften the blow, you see – doesn’t try to comfort him, and the man is not fazed by her answer, he just tu rns to another woman and asks her out instead.  He is not affected; he does not have  a reaction to something that he should have a reaction to.

 Now, Gregory was not fazed by what happened, even though  the woman was close to hysterics.  “Hysterics” (hysterics) is when you have uncont rolled emotions, when you can’t stop crying because the emotion i s so strong in you. Cho says, “That’s terrible.  I’ll try to remember to be more compassionate with my patients.”  “To be compassionate” means to be caring, to be kind, to be nice to someone.  Joy says, “Don’t worry.  It’s against your nature t o be anything but considerate.”  The expression “to be against your natur e” means it’s something that you can’t do because it’s not part of your personali ty; it’s not part of your character, it’s not part of who you are.  “Anything but”  is a phrase we use to emphasize the next word by saying it is definitely not tru e.  For example: “The movie was anything but boring.  It was, in fact, very excit ing.”  In this case, Joy is saying that Cho is anything but considerate.  “To be consi derate” means to be nice, to be aware of other people’s feelings.  Joy is sayi ng that it is against Cho’s nature, it is impossible for Cho to be anything but consi derate; he is not going to be mean to his patients.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cho:  I’m not sure I’m cut out to be a doctor.

Joy:  I think you’ll be great.  I’ve seen you with patient s and you have a great bedside manner – not like Gregory.

Cho:  Why?  What’s wrong with his bedside manner?

Joy:  I’ve seen him with patients and he can be really cal lous.  For instance, I was in the room last week when he was telling one of hi s patients that she was taking a turn for the worse.

Cho:  What did he say?

Joy:  He just blurted it out.  He told her the diagnosi s, and he didn’t even try to soften the news when she asked about her prognosis.  He di d absolutely nothing to try to comfort or reassure her.

Cho:  I feel sorry for the patient.

Joy:  That’s the point.  Gregory didn’t, and it didn’t  seem to faze him that the patient was very upset and close to hysterics.

 Cho:  That’s terrible.  I’ll try to remember to be m ore compassionate with my patients.

Joy:  Don’t worry.  It’s against your nature to be anythin g but considerate.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 67: Buying Men’s Shirts.

This episode is called “Buying Men’s Shirts.”  It’s a dialo gue between Francesca and Eddie using a lot of vocabulary that you would need to know to buy a shirt for a man.  Let’s get shopping!

[start of dialogue]

Francesca:  Hurry up!  Come out of that fitting room so  I can see how the dress shirt fits.

Eddie:  The first one didn’t fit at all.  The sleeves were too short and it was too form fitting.  I like my shirts to be on the roomy side.   I’m trying on the second one.

Francesca:  Come on, let me see.  Okay, I think this one f its you pretty well.  The collar is the right size, not too loose or tight.  The cu ffs on this one fall at just the right place, don’t you think?

Eddie:  Yeah, it’s fine.

Francesca:  Try on the T-shirts.

Eddie:  Okay, but I’m not trying on the fancy ones with a  V-neck.  I like my T- shirts the old-fashioned way – with a crew neck.

Francesca:  All right, but try on the short-sleeve and t he long-sleeve ones, too. Hurry up.

 Eddie:  Hold on, I’m changing as fast as I can.  Oh, ge ez.  I’ve heard of oversized T-shirts, but this is ridiculous.

Francesca:  Let me see.  You’re right.  You’ve got enou gh room in there for two people!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Francesca saying to Eddie, “Hurr y up (meaning go faster)!  Come out of that fitting room so I can see h ow the dress shirt fits.”  A “fitting room” is a small room with a door where you ca n try on clothing.  You can take off your clothing that you are wearing, in a store,  and put on the new clothing – the clothing you are deciding whether you are  going to buy or not. Usually, the fitting room has a mirror so you can look a t yourself.  Most stores that sell clothing have fitting rooms; sometimes they’re ca lled “dressing rooms,” but “fitting room” is the more common expression.

Francesca says that she wants Eddie to come out so she can see  the dress shirt and how it fits.  A “dress shirt” is a nice men’s shirt, som ething that you would wear for work in an office, something a little more fo rmal, usually with buttons down the front.  The verb “to fit,” when we’re talki ng about clothing, means to be the right size for your body.  So if someone says, “These  pants don’t fit, they’re too small,” what they are saying is the pants are not ri ght for me, I can’t wear them, they’re not the right size – because I’m so fat, yo u see!  “Fit” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Le arning Guide for some additional explanations.

Eddie says, “The first one didn’t fit at all.”  It didn ’t fit him; it wasn’t the right size for him.  He says, “The sleeves were too short and it was too form fitting.”  The “sleeve” is the part of the shirt that covers your arms, fr om your shoulder to, usually, your wrist, right above your hand.  Sometimes, i f it’s a “short-sleeve shirt,” the sleeve only goes down to right above your elb ow.  He says the shirt is too form fitting.  Something that is “too form fitti ng” means it’s too tight; it fits against your body too closely, usually showing the shape of your body better. But if you don’t have a body that is in good shape, well , you really don’t want anyone to see it, so form fitting is a bad thing if you  don’t have a good body, and a good thing if you do.  Eddie says, “I like my shirts to be on the roomy side.” “Roomy” means lots of extra space, big.  The expression “to be on the (something) side,” in this case “on the roomy side,” means to be a little bit (this particular adjective), so a little bit roomy – a little bit on the roomy side.  You could say, “That car is a little bit on the expensive side, ” meaning it’s too

 expensive.  Eddie says to Francesca, “I’m trying on the secon d one.”  “To try on” means to put, in this case, a piece of clothing on you to see if you like it or not.

Eddie is still inside the fitting room; he’s talking to Francesca over the door. Francesca says, “Come on, let me see.”  She wants to have him open the door and come out so she can see him.  Then she says, “Okay, I th ink this one fits you pretty well.  The collar is the right size, not too loose  or tight.”  The “collar” is the part of the shirt that is that is up against your neck, of ten closed with a button.  To be “loose” means that you are able to move it back and f orth; there’s a lot of room.  To be “tight” means not to be able to move some thing back and forth, to be too small.  She’s saying that the collar is not too lo ose and not too tight.  “The cuffs,” she says, “on this one (on this shirt) fall at just t he right place.”  The “cuff” (cuff) is at the very end of your sleeve on a formal or dr ess shirt.  Usually there’s a button to close the sleeve, or on a very formal shirt you  can wear what are called “cufflinks,” which are little pieces of metal that  you put on and it serves the same function as a button.  Francesca says the cuff falls at j ust the right place. To “fall,” here, means to hang, to rest without any sup port below.  What she’s really saying here is that the cuff goes down to the righ t length; it’s the right length for his arm.  “Fall” has several different meani ngs in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations

Eddie says, “Yeah, it’s fine.”  Then Francesca says, “Try on t he T-shirts.”  Eddie says, “Okay, but I’m not trying on the fancy ones with a V- neck.  I like my T-shirts the old-fashioned way – with a crew neck.”  “T-shirts” are  informal shirts, or shirts, usually white, that you wear underneath a forma l shirt.  They can be either “V-neck,” meaning that the collar, the part by the neck, goes down in the shape of a “V” in front, or they can be “crew (crew) neck,” wh ich means that they’re perfectly round.  So we have V-neck T-shirts and crew neck T- shirts.  Don’t confuse “crew neck” with another expression, “crew cut.”  A  “crew cut” is when you have your hair cut very short, like is often common for m en when they go into the army.  The government cuts their hair in a crew cut – very short hair.  This is a “crew neck,” meaning a round collar on a shirt or on a  T-shirt.

Francesca says, “All right, but try on the short-sleeve and long-sleeve ones, too.” As we said earlier, a “short-sleeve shirt” is a shirt whe re the sleeve only goes down beyond the shoulder, between the shoulder and the elbow.  A “long-sleeve shirt” is a shirt where the sleeve goes all the way down to the wrist, down to the hand.

Eddie says, “Hold on, I’m changing as fast as I can.”  Fra ncesca wants him to go faster.  Then he says, “Oh, geez (oh, goodness – oh, dear ).  I’ve heard of oversized T-shirts, but this is ridiculous.”  Something tha t is “oversized” is

 something that is bigger than necessary, something that i s too big.  Eddie is using another common expression in daily conversation: “I’ve  heard of (something), but this is ridiculous.”  “I’ve heard of it snowing outside, but this is ridiculous.  There is five feet of snow on the ground.”  That form of an expression is used to express how you think this is excessive – this is unu sual, this situation.

Francesca says, “Let me see.  You’re right.  You’ve got en ough room in there for two people!”  Francesca agrees with Eddie that the shirt  is too big; it’s oversized. She says he has enough room – enough space in there for two people, that’s how big the shirt is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Francesca:  Hurry up!  Come out of that fitting room so  I can see how the dress shirt fits.

Eddie:  The first one didn’t fit at all.  The sleeves were too short and it was too form fitting.  I like my shirts to be on the roomy side.   I’m trying on the second one.

Francesca:  Come on, let me see.  Okay, I think this one f its you pretty well.  The collar is the right size, not too loose or tight.  The cu ffs on this one fall at just the right place, don’t you think?

# Organizing Your Office

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 468.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can go there to download  a Learning Guide for this episode, which will help you improve your English eve n faster – and also make you a little better looking!

This episode is a story about organizing your office.  If yo u are a “messy” person, a person who has things in a disorganized way, this will b e a good episode for you.  You’ll learn some vocabulary about organizing your self.  Let’s get started. > I have a very disorganized office.  My co-workers have been m aking jokes about my office for a long time, and my boss finally cracked down on me.  He told me: “Get the office organized by Friday – no excuses!”  What ch oice did I have?
> I’ve always been a pack rat.  I hate to throw anything ou t, but I was determined to turn over a new leaf.  It’s true I’ve worked in the same  office for four years and have accumulated a lot of paper, but if I put my mind t o it, I’m sure I could get rid of all of the clutter.
> There are piles of paper and files all over my desk and so rting them out won’t be easy.  All I need to do, though, is to purge my filing cabinets of old files to make room for new ones.  I also need to triage the papers o n my desk, on the floor, and in my overflowing inbox.  Then, I only need to make new files and label them.  Finally, I’ll only keep those things on my desk tha t are essential and get rid of anything that isn’t.
> That’s a pretty good plan, don’t you think?  I’ve alrea dy made a to-do list.  Now all I need to do is start on those tasks!

My story begins by saying, “I have a very disorganized office.”  Something that is “disorganized” is something that is not organized, when  you don’t know where

 everything is that you own; things are very messy.  I say that my co-workers have been making jokes about my office for a long time, and m y boss finally cracked down on me.  “To crack down on (someone)” is a phrasal e xpression meaning to be very strict, to make someone follow every single rule.  “ To crack down” means to suddenly enforce a law that perhaps was not enforce d before.  When the police crack down on protesters, they may be violent with th em in order to get them to stop, arresting them and so forth.  It can be  both a noun and a verb: a “crackdown” could be a noun; “to crack down” is the verb, of  course.

In this case, my boss cracked down on me, he made me follow  the rules.  He told me: “Get the office organized by Friday – no excuses!” mean ing I will not accept any excuses – any reasons why your office is not organized.  I say, “What choice did I have (what else could I do)?”  I then say that I’ve  always been a pack rat. The expression “pack (pack) rat (rat)” refers to someone who  saves everything, who never throws things away, even when those things are n ot useful anymore. “I hate to throw anything out,” I say, “but I was dete rmined to turn over a new leaf.”  I was determined – I had decided to turn over  a new leaf.  “To turn over a new leaf” (leaf) means to have a new beginning, to ch ange your habits and do something in a completely different way.

Well, I say I’m going to turn over a new leaf; I also say it’s true that I’ve worked in the same office for four years and have accumulated a lot of paper.  “To accumulate” means to increase the quantity of something o ver a period of time, usually in a specific place, to add more of something in a  given place.  If you say, “I’ve accumulated a lot of old newspapers on my dining ro om table,” they have increased, there are more and more of them; I need to  do something about them, such as throw them out.  I say that if I put my mind to it, I’m sure I could get rid of all of the clutter.  “To put your mind to (something) ” is an expression that means to commit to something, to decide that you are going to  do it, no excuses, even if it’s difficult.  “Clutter” (clutter) is a mess, many thin gs that are not where they should be.  Many of us have clutter in our closets; they a re full of things that are not very well organized, things that often don’t belon g there.

I say that there are piles of paper and files all over my desk.  A “pile of (something)” is a group of many objects, one on top of t he other.  You could have a pile of papers, many papers on top of each other; you  could have a pile of books, one book on top of another.  “Files” are holder s for a group of papers, usually about a particular topic or a particular organiza tion or person – customer, for example.  We all, in an office, have files, places wh ere we keep papers about a similar topic together.

 I say that there are piles of paper and files all over my desk and sorting them out won’t be easy.  “To sort (something) out” means to organ ize them.  You can also just say “to sort.”  “To sort” usually means putting thin gs in order, in the proper sequence.  “To sort things out,” however, has a little mo re general meaning, meaning to organize things to, to clarify, to make a situ ation easier to understand or to resolve differences among people about something.   Here, it just means to organize these piles of paper and files.

I say, “All I need to do is to purge my filing cabinets of old files.”  “To purge” (purge) means to get rid of something, to throw someth ing away, to remove something.  I’m going to purge my filing cabinets.  A “ cabinet,” here, is a piece of furniture; a “filing cabinet” usually is made of metal or wood and has large drawers where you put the individual files.  I have fili ng cabinets of old files, if I purge them – if I get rid of some of them, I’ll be able to make room for new ones. “To make room for (something)” means to make space availab le for something, to move something out so that you can put something else in there.

I say, “I also need to triage the papers on my desk.”  “To  triage” (triage) means to decide which is the most important thing: what you have to do right now, what you have to do later, and so forth.  Doctors, if they are in a medical emergency at a hospital and they have dozens of people coming – lots of patients with injuries after an accident, for example – they may have to perfor m a triage.  They have to triage – separate the patients that are most sick from those that can wait a little. In this case, I’m triaging the papers; I’m sorting them  to get the most important ones first.  I also have an overflowing inbox.  An “inbox”  can be part of your email program, where you first see your messages.  An “inbox” can  also be a small box where you put papers that you need to work on.  Is someth ing is “overflowing,” we mean that there’s too much of it so that the contain er, in this case the box, is too small because you have so many papers and files.  It’s overflowing.

“Then,” I say, “I only need to make new files and label  them.”  “To label” (label) means to put a small piece of paper with a written de scription onto an object so that you know what that object is.  “To label your file s” means to write on the top of the file what is inside of this file so you can find it easily.  “Label” has a couple of different meanings in English however, so take a look at that Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

I say that finally, I’ll only keep those things on my desk th at are essential and get rid of anything that isn’t.  “Essential” means very import ant, the most important, critical.  I’m going to only keep the most important thi ngs – the essential things, and get rid of anything that isn’t essential.  “That’s a pretty good plan, don’t you think?” I ask, “I’ve already made a to-do list.”  A “to- do list” is a piece of paper

 where you write down all of the things that you have to  do.  I say that all I need now is to start on those tasks.  A “task” is something that yo u have to do; it’s an action, it’s an activity.  You can’t just write down a list  of your tasks, you actually have to do them.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal spe ed. > I have a very disorganized office.  My co-workers have been m aking jokes about my office for a long time, and my boss finally cracked down on me.  He told me: “Get the office organized by Friday – no excuses!”  What ch oice did I have?
> I’ve always been a pack rat.  I hate to throw anything ou t, but I was determined to turn over a new leaf.  It’s true I’ve worked in the same  office for four years and have accumulated a lot of paper, but if I put my mind t o it, I’m sure I could get rid of all of the clutter.

# Rearranging Living Room Furniture

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 69: Rearranging Living Room Furniture.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 469.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  Our Learning Guides contain all of the vocabul ary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions , cultural notes, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Amy and Jacob about th eir living room furniture.  The “living room” is the large room where  people normally sit on a couch and watch television, talk to each other.  They are g oing to talk about the furniture – the things that they have inside their livin g room that they use and sit on.  They’re going to talk about different types of li ving room furniture, so it will be a good vocabulary episode.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Amy:  I think rearranging the furniture will make the  living room look more spacious.  Don’t you?

Jacob:  Uh, sure.

Amy:  Can you help me move this couch against this wall?

Jacob:  Okay, but are you sure you want it over there?  B ecause it’s really heavy and a pain to move.

Amy:  I’m sure.  Let’s move the loveseat across from it.  N ow, can you move the recliner into the corner?

Jacob:  Uh!  Here?

Amy:  Umm…a little to the left.  Perfect!

Jacob:  Are you sure?

 Amy:  Absolutely!  Okay, the end tables go on each side of the couch, and the coffee table goes between the couch and the loveseat.

Jacob:  Where do you want the ottoman and where do the  lamps go?

Amy:  Put the ottoman next to the loveseat.  The table  lamps go on the end tables and the floor lamp should go next to the recline r.

Jacob:  There’s no room for the rocking chair.

Amy:  Hmm…I guess the rocking chair can go into the guestro om.

Jacob:  What about the credenza?

Amy:  You’re right.  This new configuration won’t work.

Jacob:  You mean you want to put everything back to where  it was?

Amy:  Yup, we’re back to square one!

[end of dialogue]

Amy begins our dialogue by saying, “I think rearranging t he furniture will make the living room look more spacious.”  “To rearrange” mea ns to change the position of objects in a particular area, to move thing s from one place to another. You can rearrange the things on your desk.  You can put your computer on the left side, your pens on the right side; you can move them  around – you can rearrange them.

Amy wants to rearrange the furniture in the living roo m.  “Furniture” refers to things like chairs, couches, tables, and so forth.  They are in the living room, the main or large room in the house; Amy wants it to look m ore spacious.  “More spacious” means with a lot more space, or simply larger, in  this case.  So she thinks that by rearranging the furniture, you can make the living room look larger than it is.

Jacob says, “Oh, sure.”  He’s not too excited, as most husband s probably wouldn’t be!  Amy says, “Can you help me move this couch ag ainst this wall?” The “couch” is another word for the sofa; it’s a large piece of furniture that three or more people can sit on.  Usually it’s in a straight li ne – it’s a long rectangle. It’s very common in American living rooms to have a big cou ch where several people can sit together.  Amy is asking Jacob to help move this couch “against

 the wall,” meaning close to that wall.  Jacob says, “Oka y, but are you sure you want it over there?  Because it’s really heavy and a pain  to move,” meaning it’s very difficult to move; it’s very heavy, it weighs a lot.  Amy says, “I’m sure.  Let’s move the loveseat across from it.”  A “loveseat” (one word ) is another word for a small sofa, usually with room for just two people.  It’ s called a loveseat because there are just two people, so if it’s a little small le t’s hope that you like the person next you!

Amy wants to move the loveseat across from the couch – in fro nt of, on the other side of the couch.  Amy says, “Now, can you move the reclin er into the corner?” A “recliner” (recliner) is a piece of furniture you sit o n; it’s basically a large chair. But normally, it is possible to move the chair so that it  lies flat, or closer to like a bed.  So you can sit up like a regular chair, but then  you can usually move it so that the back of the chair leans back even farther, so you a re almost lying down.

Well, Jacob says, “Uh!  Here?” and Amy says, “Umm…a little to  the left,” meaning move it a little bit to the left.  Jacob asks, “A re you sure?”  Amy says, “Absolutely!” meaning yes, I’m definitely sure.  Then she says, “Okay, the end tables go on each side of the couch.”  An “end table” is a small table in a living room.  Usually they are placed on both ends of a couch o r a loveseat.  They’re places where people can put their glasses or cups if they are drinking something, for example.  Amy says that she wants the end tables to go on each side – on both sides of the couch, and the coffee table to go bet ween the couch and the loveseat.  A “coffee table” is a larger table.  It’s shor t, meaning it’s low to the ground; it’s not a tall table, but it’s long, and you  will often see a coffee table in front of a large couch in an American living room.  It’ s a place like an end table, where you can put your coffee cup or magazines.  Some p eople like to buy big books with colorful photographs that they put on their c offee table.  These are even called “coffee table books,” the kind of books that ha ve beautiful pictures that people can look at.  Actually, nobody ever looks at th em; they’re just there to look nice!

Jacob then says, “Where do you want the ottoman and where  do the lamps go?” An “ottoman” (ottoman) it is a piece of furniture tha t looks like a small table, but there is a cushion on top of it.  It’s made of some sort  of soft fabric or leather, and it’s used not as a table but to put your feet on.  If yo u are sitting on the couch or the loveseat, it’s a place where you can put your feet up  so that your legs are horizontal.  Amy says, “Put the ottoman next to the lovesea t.  The table lamps go on the end tables and the floor lamp should go next to the recliner.”  A “table lamp” is a lamp, something with a light bulb in it, t hat you put on, of course, a table, like an end table.  A “floor lamp” is taller; it sits on the floor and can be put just about anywhere.

 Amy wants the floor lamp to go next to the recliner.  Jacob says, “There’s no room for the rocking chair.”  A “rocking chair” is a special  chair that has curved pieces of wood or metal that allow you to go back and fo rth, back and forth.  A young mother with her baby might use a rocking chair to g o back and forth, to have that gentle movement to help the baby calm down o r even to fall asleep.  I don’t know!  Rocking chairs have been associated also with older people – grandma and grandpa sitting in a rocking chair.  So it’ s a chair, but it doesn’t have four legs that sit on the ground.  Instead, it has these semi-circular pieces of wood or metal – usually wood – that go back and forth,  that allow you to move the chair back and forth as you sit on it.

Amy says that she guesses the rocking chair can go into the gu estroom.  A “guestroom” in a house is an extra bedroom where people  who are visiting can stay – can sleep.  Not every house is big enough to have a g uestroom.  If you have a big house, and you don’t have very many people livi ng at your house, you may have more than one guestroom.  I don’t have any guest rooms, just so you know!

Jacob says, “What about the credenza?”  A “credenza” is a l arge, short piece of wooden furniture.  It doesn’t have any legs, but there are doors and shelves in it. It’s used to put books or dishes or other items.  So it’s l ike a short cabinet where you store things – where you can keep things.  Amy then sa ys, “You’re right. This new configuration won’t work.”  “Configuration” d escribes the way that something is arranged or ordered, the way things work to gether.  Amy is saying this new arrangement of the furniture – this rearrang ement isn’t going to work. The configuration won’t work; it’s not good, it’s not a  good way of arranging things.

Jacob then says, “You mean you want to put everything back t o where it was?” He’s asking if Amy wants him to move all furniture where it was before they started rearranging, and Amy says, “Yup (meaning yes), we’ re back to square one!”  The expression “to be back to square one” means to  return to a point or a situation where you began.  You haven’t made any progre ss; you didn’t get any benefit from all the work you did.  So if you are, for example, working on a project and everything is on your laptop computer, and then you  lose your laptop computer, you don’t have any of those files saved anywhere else.  You’re back to square one, you have to start at the beginning again, yo u have to start over.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Amy:  I think rearranging the furniture will make the  living room look more spacious.  Don’t you?

Jacob:  Uh, sure.

Amy:  Can you help me move this couch against this wall?

Jacob:  Okay, but are you sure you want it over there?  B ecause it’s really heavy and a pain to move.

Amy:  I’m sure.  Let’s move the loveseat across from it.  N ow, can you move the recliner into the corner?

Jacob:  Where do you want the ottoman and where do the  lamps go?

# Avoiding Show and Movie  Spoilers

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 70: Avoiding Show and Movie Spoilers.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 470.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Lee and Kira about something called a “spoiler,” which is when you tell someone how a movie or a television show ends – what its conclusion is.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lee:  I’m reading this article about the new season of our favorite show.  It’s premiering next week.

Kira:  Don’t tell me anything about it, especially spoil ers.

Lee:  But don’t you want to know which guest stars will be making appearances and the plot twists that are coming up?

Kira:  No, I don’t!  I don’t watch movie trailers and I don’t read reviews.  It spoils the fun when you already know what’s going to happen.  Where’s the suspense?

Lee:  The blogs and reviews I read all have “spoiler al erts” and I avoid reading those sections.  Let me just tell you one thing I read…

Kira:  Stop right there!  I’m covering my ears.  I wan t to stay in the dark, completely in the dark.  Got it?

Lee:  Okay, I won’t let the cat out of the bag, but we ’re in for a wild ride this season.

Kira:  I’m not listening!  I’m not listening!

 [end of dialogue]

Lee begins our dialogue by saying, “I’m reading this art icle about the new season of our favorite show.”  A “season” (season) here means a period of time when a series of television programs are being shown.  There’s u sually, in the United States, a fall and spring television season, when televisi on programs begin.  The word “season,” however, has a couple of different meanin gs in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explan ations.

Lee says that the television show that he and Kira like is premiering next week. “To premiere” means to be shown for the very first time .  If the television show premieres tomorrow, that means that it is the first tim e you have seen that show or that series of shows on television; it’s the first time .  You can also have a movie that premieres; we have lots of movies that premie re here in Los Angeles. The noun is, simply, “premiere.”

Kira says, “Don’t tell me anything about it, especially the spoilers.”  A “spoiler” is something that is said or written that lets other peopl e know what happens at the end of a book, a movie, or a television show.  Most of us don’t want to know how the show ends or the movie ends, and if you do that it’ s called a “spoiler.”  “Spoil” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a lo ok at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lee says, “But don’t you want to know which guest stars wil l be making appearances and the plot twists that are coming up?”  A “guest star” is an actor who appears on just one or two, maybe three shows, but is someone who is not a regular part of the television program.  “To make an  appearance” means to be present, to come to an event or to be on a show.  “He m ade an appearance on the television show” means he was on the TV show, probabl y not for a very long time however.  A “plot twist” (twist) is something unexpe cted that happens in the story, especially in a book or a movie.  A boy falls in love with a girl, and then halfway through the book the boy sees the girl’s sister an d falls in love with her sister.  That would be a “plot twist.”  That would also  probably end his first relationship with the other sister, but that’s too compl icated to talk about here! “Plot” is simply the story, so a “plot twist” is a change in  the story.  When we use the expression “coming up,” we mean it will happen in t he near future, it will happen soon.  This is an expression you often see on televisi on: “Coming up next, we’ll learn if Rachel and Ross actually kiss!”  That’s the next thing that we will see on the program.  Often that happens right be fore a commercial or advertising break to get you to come back, to stay with the program to see what happens.

 Kira answers Lee’s question: “No, I don’t!” meaning I d on’t want to know which guest stars will be making appearances and the plot twi sts that are coming up. She says, “I don’t watch movie trailers and I don’t read reviews.”  A “movie trailer” (trailer) is an advertisement for a movie, often shown i n the movie theater before the movie you are going to see begins.  So, you sit down  to watch a movie, but first they show you advertisements for other movies.  These  are called “movie trailers.”  You can also see movie trailers on the Web no w.  A “review” means, in this case, a written opinion about a movie, a book, or a  television show; really anything, someone’s opinion about some product or some m ovie, something that is entertaining or interesting.  It could be in a new spaper; it could be on a website.  Many newspapers have “movie reviewers,” who every w eek, give their opinion about a movie and whether you should go to see  it.

Well, Kira doesn’t read reviews.  She says that they spoil the fun when you already know what’s going to happen.  “To spoil,” as a ve rb, means to ruin something, to make something less fun or less useful, or perhaps even less helpful: “I went out to dinner with my wife last nigh t, but the evening was spoiled because there was a crying child in the table next to me.”   My evening was spoiled – it was ruined.  Kira says, “It spoils the fun wh en you already know what’s going to happen.  Where’s the suspense?”  “Suspe nse” is this feeling of anticipation or excitement before something happens.  Al fred Hitchcock was a famous movie director who made a lot of movies with suspe nse; you didn’t know what was going to happen next, or you were waiting for  it with excitement.

Lee says, “The blogs and reviews I read all have “spoiler a lerts” and I avoid reading those sections.”  A “spoiler alert” is when someon e tells you, usually on a website or in a newspaper article, that they are going  to give you information about the movie and how it ends, so if you don’t want to know that, you can stop reading right now.  So if a review says “spoiler alert, ” then don’t read any more because you’ll find out more about the movie, unless, of course, you don’t care about reading a spoiler.

So Lee says that he doesn’t read after he sees a spoiler a lert, but he also wants to tell Kira something else.  He says, “Let me just tell  you one thing I read,” and Kira says, “Stop right there!” meaning stop immediately.   “I’m covering my ears,” so she can’t hear.  “I want to stay in the dark, complete ly in the dark.”  “To stay in the dark” or “be in the dark” means not to know someth ing, not to be told something, to be ignorant.  “I was in the dark about why my girlfriend left me” – I didn’t know why; it was a mystery to me.  It’s always a myster y to me!  Well, Kira wants to stay in the dark, she doesn’t want to know anythin g more about the television show, and then she says to Lee, “Got it?”  “Go t it?” here is an informal

 expression asking if the person understands you: “Do you un derstand?  Am I clear?”

Lee says, “Okay, I won’t let the cat out of the bag.”  “T o let the cat out of the bag” means to accidentally tell someone a secret, to tell someo ne something that they’re not supposed to know.  “He let the cat out of  the bag when he told his son that he was going to get a new bicycle for his birthday.”   He didn’t mean to tell him, but he accidentally did – he let the cat out of the bag.  I’m not sure why the cat was in the bag; I would keep the cat in the bag if it were me, but that’s the expression.  Lee says, “we’re in for a wild ride this seaso n.”  “To be in for a wild ride” means we’re going to have a lot of fun or excite ment or surprises for a certain amount of time; many unexpected things are going  to happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lee:  I’m reading this article about the new season of our favorite show.  It’s premiering next week.

Kira:  Don’t tell me anything about it, especially spoil ers.

Lee:  But don’t you want to know which guest stars will be making appearances and the plot twists that are coming up?

Kira:  No, I don’t!  I don’t watch movie trailers and I don’t read reviews.  It spoils the fun when you already know what’s going to happen.  Where’s the suspense?

# Trying to Get Off the Phone

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 71: Trying to Get Off the Phone.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 471.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode has a Learning Guide, you can find it on o ur website at eslpod.com. The Learning Guide will help you improve your English even faster by giving you some additional definitions, cultural notes, sample sente nces, and a complete transcript of this episode.

This episode is a telephone conversation between Erin a nd Curran.  It’s all about trying to get off the phone – trying to end a telepho ne conversation.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Erin:  So I told Joey that I had no intention of lett ing him use my car again.  Can you believe the nerve of that guy, after what he did?

Curran:  That’s terrible, but I’m going to have to le t you go.  I have an appointment…

Erin:  But I didn’t tell you what else he said.  He sa id that running over my cat was just an accident.  That’s bull.  He said I should be thankful that he took Fifi to a veterinarian!

Curran:  Yeah, I can see why you’re mad.  I think I have  a call on the other line…

Erin:  Well, I’m glad you agree with me.  I said to  him that Fifi may be as good as new now, but that is no thanks to him!  He’s never liked  Fifi and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was gunning for her when he ran her ove r.  He should count himself lucky he’s getting off scot-free for trying to kill my cat.  I said…

Curran:  Sorry to have to cut this short, but I really h ave to get going.

Erin:  Oh, sure, but just let me tell you what I plan to do if he asks me again.

Curran:  I really want to hear all about it, but…but …nature calls!

 Erin:  Oh, okay, call me back.  I haven’t even told you wh at Sam told me about Ben yesterday.  It’s a real shocker!

Curran:  Uh…right.  I can’t wait to hear all about it .

[end of dialogue]

We’re in the middle of a conversation between Erin and  Curran; Erin says, “So I told Joey that I had no intention of letting him use m y car again.”  “Intention” is a plan to do something, what you plan on doing.  Erin sa id she had “no intention,” meaning she wasn’t going to let Joey use her car again.   She says, “Can you believe the nerve of that guy, after what he did?”  the expression “the nerve,” especially “can you believe the nerve” or “that guy has a l ot of nerve,” means your willingness or ability to do something that is inapp ropriate, disrespectful, something that will make someone else angry, something that is not right.  “That guy has a lot of nerve,” meaning he is doing something wrong and he knows it, and it is bothering me.  Erin says, “Can you believe the nerve of that guy (of Joey)?” meaning he’s doing something that he shouldn’t b e doing by asking her to use her car again.

Curran says, “That’s terrible, but I’m going to have to  let you go.”  “To let someone go” means, in this case, to end a phone call or a  personal conversation.  The idea is that you are going to let the  other person continue with what they were doing or what they need to do, althoug h the real intention – the real reason is so that you can go back and do what you wan t to do.  So when someone says, “I’ll let you go,” often they mean “I nee d to go,” but it’s a polite way of saying I don’t want to take up any more of your t ime.  There’s a couple of different meanings of this expression, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Curran says, “I have an appointment.”  Erin, however, d oesn’t want to stop talking.  She says, “But I didn’t tell you what else he sa id.  He (Joey) said that running over my cat was just an accident.”  “To run over” means that your car goes over something; if you run over a cat, you’re probabl y going to kill it – unless it’s a very strong cat!  Erin says, “That’s bull,” spea king of what Joey said. “Bull,” here, means something that is not true, somethi ng that is a lie.  It’s actually a short form for another expression, which is vulgar – a bad expression that begins with the letter “S” and ends with the letter “ T”.  Well, this is an informal expression; you wouldn’t want to use this in your work en vironment.  When you say “that’s bull” or “bull,” that’s an informal way to e xpress that you know that this is wrong.  Erin says, “Joey said I should be thankful that he took Fifi to a

 veterinarian!”  Fifi is Erin’s cat.  A “veterinarian” is a doctor who takes care of animals such as dogs and cats.

Curran says, “Yeah, I can see why you’re mad (I understand  why you are angry). I think I have a call on the other line.”  “To have a  call on the other line” means you have another call – another phone call that you rece ive while you are talking to someone else.  You may have two phones or you may have p hones with the service that allows another person to call and to let you know by a small beep that you hear when you’re talking to someone else.  Curr an, of course, is looking for an excuse to end the conversation, that’s why he says “I think I have a call on the other line.”  Of course, we know that’s probably bu ll!

Erin says, “Well, I’m glad you agree with me,” and of co urse, she continues talking.  She says, “I said to Joey that Fifi may be as goo d as new now, but that is no thanks to him!”  The expression “to be as good as new ” means that something has been damaged or injured but now it is ju st like it were new, just as if nothing had happened to it.  So Fifi, apparently,  is alive.  I thought for sure she would die when the car ran over her, but she’s a strong  cat!  Erin says, though, that Fifi is okay, no thanks to Joey.  “No thanks to (someo ne)” is an informal expression used to emphasize that that person didn’t do an ything to help, that it is not because of what the other person did, that pers on was not responsible for what happened.

Erin says, “He’s never liked Fifi and I wouldn’t be surpr ised if he was gunning for her when he ran her over.”  “To gun for (someone or s omething),” especially if you’re in a car, means to go faster, to increase your sp eed so that you can hit someone.  This, of course, is very dangerous; you don’t want  to do this with a human being, you could hurt them or even kill them.  Joe y, however, I guess doesn’t like Fifi – I can understand why – and he is gunn ing for her, tries to kill her with the car.  Or at least, that’s what Erin thinks.   She says, “He should count himself lucky he’s getting off scot-free for trying to kill my cat.”  The expression “to count yourself lucky” means to realize or recognize that  you have had very good luck, that you are fortunate.  This often is used wh en something almost bad happens to someone, or someone does something wrong and they’re not being punished for it – they should count themselves lucky.  Joey sho uld count himself lucky that he’s getting off scot-free.  This expression, “to get off scot-free,” means not to be punished for something that you have done w rong, not to be criticized for something that you have done wrong.  We usually use t his expression when it is clear or obvious that the person is guilty but, for wha tever reason, does not get punished, for example does not go to jail if they commit  a crime (do something against the law).

 Curran does not want to continue talking to Erin, so fi nally he says, “Sorry to have to cut this short, but I really have to get going.”  Curran is trying to be very polite at the beginning, but as time passes he is more a nd more direct with Erin. He’s still being polite, but he’s trying to be more insi stent – more forceful.  He says, “Sorry to have to cut this short.”  “To cut (something ) short” means to end something before it has finished, usually because you don’t  have any more time. Curran is saying he has to cut this telephone conversation  short, he has to end it, he really has to get going.  When you say, “I have to get  going,” you mean I have to leave, I have to go away, I have to depart.

Erin says, “Oh, sure, but just let me tell you what I pla n to do if he asks me again.”  Erin will still not stop talking.  Curran the n uses another excuse; he says, “I really want to hear all about it, but nature call s!”  The expression “nature calls” is an informal one used to mean that you have to go t o the bathroom, so that you cannot stay any longer – you cannot talk any longer, “natu re calls.”  Erin says, “Oh, okay, call me back.  I haven’t even told you what Sa m told me about Ben yesterday.  It’s a real shocker!”  A “shocker” is something th at is very surprising, very unexpected.  Curran says, “Uh…right.  I can’t wait to h ear all about it.”  Of course, he doesn’t want to hear all about it, but he’s being polite.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Erin:  So I told Joey that I had no intention of lett ing him use my car again.  Can you believe the nerve of that guy, after what he did?

Curran:  That’s terrible, but I’m going to have to le t you go.  I have an appointment…

Erin:  But I didn’t tell you what else he said.  He sa id that running over my cat was just an accident.  That’s bull.  He said I should be thankful that he took Fifi to a veterinarian!

# Feeling Nervous About Public Speaking

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 72: Feeling Nervous About Public Speaking.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 472.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode. The Learning Guide contains all of the vocabulary, defi nitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes, and a complete transcript of this episode.

This episode is called “Feeling Nervous About Public Spea king.”  It’s a dialogue between Simone and Gabriel; they’re going to be talki ng about some common vocabulary used to describe when you get nervous before havin g to speak in front of a large group.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Simone:  They’re about to introduce you.  You’re on ne xt.  Are you ready?

Gabriel:  No…yes… no!

Simone:  You don’t look so well.  Are you all right?

Gabriel:  I don’t know.  My palms are clammy, I’m breaki ng out into a cold sweat, and my legs feel like jelly.

Simone:  It sounds like a bad case of stage fright, that ’s all.  Just take a deep breath.  You’ll be fine.

Gabriel:  I have butterflies in my stomach and my mouth i s dry.  Where can I get a glass of water?

Simone:  I don’t know and there isn’t time.

Gabriel:  Oh God, if I go out there, I’m going to f reeze up or get tongue-tied.  I just know it.

 Simone:  Get a hold of yourself.  You’re well prepar ed and you’ll do a great job. Okay, they’ve just announced your name.  Get out there!

Gabriel:  I can’t!

Simone:  The entire audience is waiting for you.  Pull  yourself together and get out there!

Gabriel:  Here goes nothing!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Simone saying, “They’re about  to introduce you.  You’re on next.  Are you ready?”  Simone is talking to Gabriel;  Gabriel is about to give a talk – a speech to a group of people.  Simone says, “You’ re on next,” meaning you are the next person to do something; it is your turn,  we might also say.  “Are you ready?” and Gabriel says, “No…yes…no!”  Simone says, “You don’t look so well.  Are you all right?”  Gabriel says, “I don’t know.   My palms are clammy.” Your “palms” are the insides of your hands, but not in cluding your fingers.  The word “palm” actually has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Gabriel’s palms are clammy (clammy).  “Clammy” means a li ttle bit wet, a little cold perhaps, not very pleasant to touch.  Well, if you’re  palms are clammy, typically that means you’re nervous.  Gabriel says, “I’m bre aking out into a cold sweat.”  “To break out into a cold sweat” means to sudden ly have your skin begin to feel wet, usually because you are very scared or nervous.  Gabriel also says that his legs feel like jelly.  “Jelly” is normally a sweet food made from fruit and sugar; it’s similar to another word, “jam” (jam).  But  here, it’s used to describe someone’s muscles feeling very weak.  Somebody says, “My legs fee l like jelly,” they mean my legs feel weak.  Again, probably because you a re nervous, at least that’s the case for Gabriel.

Simone says, “It sounds like a bad case of stage fright, th at’s all.”  “To have a bad case of (something)” means to have a serious or very sever e instance or situation.  You could have a bad case of coughing, if you were coughing a lot and it was causing you pain.  Well, Gabriel has a bad case of stage fright.  “Stage” describes the place where you stand to give a speech, or per haps where the actors stand when they are performing a play.  Usually it’ s a little bit higher than the floor where you are sitting.  “Fright” means to be afraid, so “stage fright” is fear of speaking or performing in front of a large g roup.  When I was in high school, I was a member of the speech team.  This was a gro up of students that

 competed with other students by giving speeches on differe nt topics.  I would always have some stage fright before it was my turn to spea k.

Simone says to Gabriel, “Just take a deep breath.  You’l l be fine.”  “To take a deep breath” means to breathe in a lot of air very slo wly; [Jeff inhales] that’s to take a deep breath.  You let it out [Jeff exhales] and  it helps relax you.  Gabriel says, “I have butterflies in my stomach and my mouth is dry. ”  The expression “to have butterflies in your stomach” means that you feel very nervous and possibly sick.  Your stomach, perhaps, is reacting to all the nervou sness, the stress.  So having butterflies in your stomach is another way of saying  how nervous you are, so nervous that you might feel ill – you might feel sick.

Gabriel says, “Where can I get a glass of water?”  Simon e says, “I don’t know and there isn’t time” – you don’t have time to go get  a glass of water.  Gabriel says, “Oh God, if I go out there, I’m going to freeze u p or get tongue-tied.  I just know it.”  When you “freeze up,” you are unable to move or do anything, usually because you are very scared or surprised at something.  “To  get tongue-tied” means to be unable to speak clearly or to say or make a com plete sentence.  So if you are freezing up and are tongue-tied, you’re not  going to be able to talk. The verb “freeze” has several different meanings in Engl ish; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Simone says, “Get a hold of yourself.”  The expression “to  get a hold of one’s self” means to calm down and control your words and action s.  Someone who becomes very excited, very angry perhaps may be unable to contr ol themselves. In Gabriel’s case, he’s very nervous, so Simone is saying get a hold of yourself, calm down, control your thoughts and actions.  “You’re we ll prepared and you’ll do a great job.”  “To be well prepared” means to be ready; you’ve done your work, you practiced – you are well prepared.

Simone then says, “Okay, they’ve just announced your name.   Get out there!” Gabriel says, “I can’t!”  Simone responds, “The entire au dience is waiting for you.”  The “audience” are the people who are waiting for Gabriel to speak. Simone says, “Pull yourself together and get out there!”   “To pull yourself together” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to calm do wn, to be able to do something.  It is similar to “get a hold of yourself,”  you have to calm down and perform – do whatever action you’re expected to do.  In this case for Gabriel, it’s to give a speech.

Gabriel ends by saying, “Here goes nothing!”  “Here goes nothing” is a phrase used to show that you are going to try to do something,  but you don’t think you are going to be successful.  When I was in college, every t ime I would ask a girl

 out on a date I would say to myself, “Here goes nothing! ”  I tried, but it usually wasn’t successful!  Gabriel, however, is going to try to give  his speech and get a hold of himself – pull himself together so that he can  give the speech effectively.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Simone:  They’re about to introduce you.  You’re on ne xt.  Are you ready?

Gabriel:  No…yes… no!

Simone:  You don’t look so well.  Are you all right?

Gabriel:  I don’t know.  My palms are clammy, I’m breaki ng out into a cold sweat, and my legs feel like jelly.

Simone:  It sounds like a bad case of stage fright, that ’s all.  Just take a deep breath.  You’ll be fine.

Gabriel:  I have butterflies in my stomach and my mouth i s dry.  Where can I get a glass of water?

Simone:  I don’t know and there isn’t time.

Gabriel:  Oh God, if I go out there, I’m going to f reeze up or get tongue-tied.  I just know it.

Simone:  Get a hold of yourself.  You’re well prepar ed and you’ll do a great job. Okay, they’ve just announced your name.  Get out there!

Gabriel:  I can’t!

Simone:  The entire audience is waiting for you.  Pull  yourself together and get out there!

Gabriel:  Here goes nothing!

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 473.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California, here in the Unite d States.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page guide that will help you im prove your English even faster.

This episode is called “Showing Respect and Disrespect.”  It ’s a dialogue between Kadir and Melissa about not being “respectful,”  not being nice, not giving someone the proper respect, and the vocabulary rel ated to that.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kadir:  Stop that!  Stop snickering!  Gabriel Voltaire  is an author of great acclaim. You should show a little reverence.

Melissa:  Yes, but he seems to have a bad case of stage frig ht.  I know it’s an honor to hear him speak, but it’s hard to show reverence when the man is sweating like a pig!

Kadir:  He’s not sweating like a pig.  He’s just talking passionately about his writing.  I, for one, appreciate his level of dedicatio n to his work.

Melissa:  I admire his work, too, but he’s making a fool of himself.  Really, who can pay attention to what he’s saying when he’s stuttering  like that.

Kadir:  Unlike you, I can listen to the genius of his wor ds without worrying about a little stuttering.

Melissa:  The man is making a spectacle of himself.  I thin k he needs to stick to writing and give up public speaking.

Kadir:  Shh!  That’s enough.  I won’t hear another w ord said against him.

 Melissa:  Whatever you say.  I’ll leave you to your hero  worship.  For me, enough is enough!

Kadir begins our dialogue by saying, “Stop that!”  “St op that” means stop doing what you are doing.  “Stop snickering!” he says.  “To sn icker” (snicker) means to laugh quietly, but in a mean way when you’re making fu n of someone else.  We sometimes use this verb for children who are laughing at other children, being mean to them.  “Gabriel Voltaire is an author of gre at acclaim,” Kadir says. They’re listening to a speech by Gabriel Voltaire; he’s an “author,” a writer of great acclaim.  “Great acclaim” means very famous for doing something well, someone who people have praised.  He says, “You should sho w a little reverence.”  “Reverence” is another word for respect, adm iration.  It’s usually something we use when talking about God, showing reveren ce to God.  But it can also be used to mean to show serious respect to someon e who is very important or very famous and deserves our respect.

Melissa says, “Yes, but he seems to have a bad case of stage f right,” he seems to be afraid of giving a speech.  Melissa says, “I know it’s an honor to hear him speak, but it’s hard to show reverence when the man is swea ting like a pig!”  To say something is “an honor” means that it is something yo u should be thankful for, something that you should be proud of usually becau se you have done something good or admirable.  In this case, “it’s an hon or to hear him speak,” means that Melissa should be grateful – should be than kful for this rare opportunity.  She says, “it’s hard to show reverence when the man (Gabriel) is sweating like a pig!”  “To sweat” means to have water t hat is coming out of your skin because you’re hot, or perhaps because you’re nervous.  In the case of Gabriel giving his speech, he’s very nervous, so he’s sweating  like a pig.  The idea is that pigs sweat a lot; they may or may not, but that’s the expression.  “To sweat like a pig” means to sweat a lot.

Kadir says, “He is not sweating like a pig.  He’s just talki ng passionately about his writing.”  “To speak passionately about (something)” is t o speak with a lot of emotion, often a lot of love for what you are talking  about.  Kadir says that Gabriel is just talking passionately about his writing, “I , for one, appreciate his level of dedication to his work.”  The expression “I, for  one…” is a somewhat formal phrase we use when we are about to give our opi nion, especially in situations where other people might not agree with us.   I, for one, think that my neighbor’s dog barks too much; he probably doesn’t agree with me!  Kadir says, “I, for one, appreciate his level of dedication to his w ork.”  “Dedication,” here, means his commitment, his hard work, his effort in his wri ting, in doing his work.

ESL Podcast 473 - Showing Respect and Disrespect

 The word “dedication” has several different meanings in  English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Melissa says, “I admire his work, too.”  “To admire” means to respect, to think something is good, to think something is impressive.  You could admire a beautiful painting; you could admire the work that your  colleague – your co- worker does.  Anything that is admired deserves great resp ect because it’s so good, because it is, perhaps, so excellent.  Melissa says, “I  admire his work,” meaning Gabriel’s writing, “but he’s making a fool of himself.”  “To make a fool of yourself” means to do something that other people may l augh at you for, and you don’t want them to laugh at you.  To make a fool of yo urself means to look silly – to look foolish in front of other people.  If I try to  play baseball, I make a fool of myself – that’s why I only watch it on television!  Melissa sa ys, “Really, who can pay attention to what he’s saying when he’s stuttering li ke that.”  “To stutter” means to not speak properly; to repeat sounds, that is stut tering.  Someone who goes: “Uh-uh-uh-uh-I,” that would be to stutter.

Kadir says, “Unlike you, I can listen to the genius of his words without worrying about a little stuttering.”  “Genius” means very smart, very intelligent.  Kadir says he can listen to the “genius of his words,” meaning the  intelligent things that are in his writing or in his speaking.  Melissa says, “The man i s making a spectacle of himself.”  “To make a spectacle of yourself” means to do som ething that would make other people look at you and think that you are st upid or foolish; they may even be laughing at you.  It’s similar to making a fool of yourself.  Melissa says, “I think he needs to stick to writing and give up public speaki ng.”  “To stick to (something)” means to continue to do something without  changing what you are doing.  I should stick to podcasting; that’s what I should continue doing because, perhaps, I’m not very good at other things.  Which is tru e; I’m not very good at most things!

Melissa wants Gabriel to “stick to writing,” meaning he sh ould continue to write but not public speaking – not giving speeches to people.  Kadir says, “Shh (be quiet)!  That’s enough.  I won’t hear another word a gainst him,” meaning I don’t want to hear any other criticisms of him.  Melissa says, “Wha tever you say,” meaning I’m not going to argue with you.  “I’ll leave  you to your hero worship,” she says.  “Hero worship” is the practice of admiring someon e very much, maybe too much.  You think of this person as being so great th at you might lose perspective; you might not see the truth.  Melissa says, “Fo r me, enough is enough!”  The expression “enough is enough” is an inform al one used to show that you have had enough of something; you no longer wa nt to be part of this situation.  For her, it means she doesn’t want to list en to Gabriel’s speech anymore.

ESL Podcast 473 - Showing Respect and Disrespect

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kadir:  Stop that!  Stop snickering!  Gabriel Voltaire  is an author of great acclaim. You should show a little reverence.

Melissa:  Yes, but he seems to have a bad case of stage frig ht.  I know it’s an honor to hear him speak, but it’s hard to show reverence when the man is sweating like a pig!

Kadir:  He’s not sweating like a pig.  He’s just talking passionately about his writing.  I, for one, appreciate his level of dedicatio n to his work.

Melissa:  I admire his work, too, but he’s making a fool of himself.  Really, who can pay attention to what he’s saying when he’s stuttering  like that.

Kadir:  Unlike you, I can listen to the genius of his wor ds without worrying about a little stuttering.

Melissa:  The man is making a spectacle of himself.  I thin k he needs to stick to writing and give up public speaking.

Kadir:  Shh!  That’s enough.  I won’t hear another w ord said against him.

Melissa:  Whatever you say.  I’ll leave you to your hero  worship.  For me, enough is enough!

We’re going to listen to a dialogue between Luis and Stevie; Stevie is a girl – a woman, here.  Stevie is going to be talking to Luis abo ut how she is having trouble sleeping at night, using a lot of vocabulary we might used to talk about that situation.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Luis:  So, how are the newlyweds doing?

Stevie:  Oh, we’re great.  I’m just a little tired.

Luis:  Well, that goes with the territory, right?

Stevie:  No, that’s not what I mean.  Patrick has been ke eping me up with his snoring.

Luis:  Oh, that’s a bummer.

Stevie:  Yeah, it really is.  I’m usually awakened soon a fter I fall asleep, and then I toss and turn all night.  That’s not all.  Patrick also  talks in his sleep.

Luis:  Wow, that’s terrible.  I’d make a beeline for so me sleeping pills, if I were you.

Stevie:  I took some one night last week, but I woke up g roggy and disoriented. I’d rather have insomnia than load up on drugs.

Luis:  Have you tried waking him up when he snores or tal ks in his sleep?

ESL Podcast 474 - Having Trouble Sleeping

 Stevie:  I tried that one night, but he just ended up  sleepwalking!

Luis:  Geez, what are you going to do?

Stevie:  I wish I knew.

Luis:  It’s a little early in your marriage for separate  bedrooms, but I wouldn’t rule it out.

Stevie:  I’ll keep it in mind.  If I don’t get a good  night’s sleep soon, separate bedrooms will be the least of our problems!

[end of dialogue]

Luis asks Stevie, “So, how are the newlyweds doing?”  A “ newlywed” (newlywed – one word) is someone who has been married very recentl y, usually within the past year or so.  So the year after you are married, you might be called a “newlywed,” meaning you have been married recently.  Thi s is a question that Luis asks Stevie; he’s asking about Stevie and her new husban d.  Stevie says, “Oh, we’re great.  I’m just a little tired.”  Luis j okes with her and says, “Well, that goes with the territory, right?”  The expression “to go with the territory” means that it’s to be expected in a particular situation, it’s expected to be part of something.  So if you are a police officer, you need to learn to use a gun.  It goes with the territory: it’s part of your job; it’s part of  your responsibility.

Luis is making a joke here, saying that Stevie is not getti ng very much sleep because she’s newly married, and newly married couples may do other things at night, for example, that would cause them not to sleep  as much.  I’m not sure; I’ve been married too long, I don’t remember far back in time!  Stevie says, “No, that’s not what I mean,” meaning no, she is not having  problems sleeping because she and her husband are doing other things in be d.  Stevie says, “Patrick (her husband) has been keeping me up with his sno ring.”  “To keep (someone) up” means to keep them awake, not allowing them to sleep.  “To snore” (snore) means to make a loud sound each time you b reathe through your nose while you are sleeping, something like [Jeff snores] .  I know, it’s pretty ugly, but that me snoring.

Luis says, “Oh, that’s a bummer.”  A “bummer” (bummer) i s an informal term meaning a disappointment, something that you feel badl y about: “I’m not going to be able to go to the concert tonight, what a bummer, ” or “that’s a bummer.”  It’s a bad thing.  It’s an informal expression, however.  Stevi e says, “Yeah, it really is,”

ESL Podcast 474 - Having Trouble Sleeping

 meaning yes, it is a bummer.  “I’m usually awakened soon after I fall asleep,” she says.  “To awaken” means to wake up or to wake someone else  up.  She wakes up soon after she falls asleep.  “To fall asleep” means t o begin to sleep: “I fell asleep last night at 11:30 p.m.”  Stevie says, “then I to ss and turn all night.”  The expression “to toss and turn” means to move your body; fi rst you lie on your left, then you lie on your right.  You keep moving back and for th because you can’t fall asleep, that’s to toss and turn.

Stevie says that Patrick also talks in his sleep.  “To talk in your sleep” means to start saying things even though you are unconscious – even th ough you are sleeping.  This can be very dangerous, especially if you’re d reaming about your former girlfriend, for example, or boyfriend, or dog – if your dog is in the room where you are sleeping, for example!  Luis says, “Wow, tha t’s terrible.  I’d make a beeline for some sleeping pills, if I were you.”  “I’d make a beeline for” means I would go directly to something without any hesitation.  “To make a beeline for (something)” means to go to do something or to go som ewhere right away, without hesitating, without stopping, to do it immedi ately.

Luis says, “(I would immediately get) some sleeping pills.”   “Sleeping pills” are drugs that help you sleep.  Stevie says, “I took some (I t ook some sleeping pills) one night last week (meaning last week – one night in  the last week), but I woke up groggy and disoriented.”  “To be groggy” (groggy) m eans that you are very tired; usually you just woke up and you’re not mentally a wake yet, you’re not able to move or think normally.  This happens, too, sometimes i f you take a certain drug; the drug could make you groggy – could make you sleep y, could make you not as alert as you would be otherwise.  “To be disorien ted” means to not know where you are or what is happening, to be confused.  If  someone spins you around very fast or gives you a certain drug, you might  become disoriented: you’re not sure where you are, what you’re doing here,  what is going on.

Stevie says, “I’d rather have insomnia than load up on dr ugs.”  She prefers, she says, she’d rather have insomnia.  “Insomnia” is the inabil ity to sleep during the nighttime or most nights.  Insomnia: not able to sleep .  “To load up on (something)” means to have, to use, to eat, or to bu y a lot of something.  “I’m going to load up on pasta when I go the grocery store”  – I’m going to get lots and lots of pasta because I love pasta.  I do, I really do!  I’m going to load up on it. The word “load” has several different meanings in Engl ish however, so take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Stevie says that she’d rather have insomnia than load up o n drugs.  Luis says, “Have you tried waking him up when he snores or talks in h is sleep (have you tried waking Patrick up)?”  “To wake (someone) up” mean s to make a noise or do

ESL Podcast 474 - Having Trouble Sleeping

 something so that they stop sleeping.  Stevie says, “I trie d that one night, but he just ended up sleepwalking!”  “He just ended up…” means t he final result was…, what happened after I did that was…; in this case, he e nded up sleepwalking. “To sleepwalk” means to get out of your bed and to start  walking, even though you are still sleeping.  You don’t usually remember thi s after you wake up.  That is sleepwalking.

Luis says, “Geez, what are you going to do?”  “Geez,” here , just is an expression of surprise or, in this case perhaps, confusion.  Stevie says, “I wish I knew,” meaning I don’t know, I wish I did know.  Luis says, “It’s a little early in your marriage for separate bedrooms, but I wouldn’t rule it out.”  Luis is saying that maybe you should sleep in different rooms although you j ust got married, so it’s a little early for that.  He says, however, he wouldn’t ru le it out.  “To rule (something) out” is to decide not to do something, to d ecide that something is not an option.  I’m not going to do that in the future,  I’m not even going to consider it – I’m going to rule it out.  “Rule” has several diffe rent meanings, also, in English, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some additiona l explanations.

Finally, Stevie says, “I’ll keep it in mind.”  “To keep (so mething) in mind” means I will consider it, I will not forget about it.  “If I don’t get a good night’s sleep soon,” she says, “separate bedrooms will be the least of our pr oblems!” meaning we will have more serious problems than just sleeping in differen t rooms.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Luis:  So, how are the newlyweds doing?

Stevie:  Oh, we’re great.  I’m just a little tired.

Luis:  Well, that goes with the territory, right?

Stevie:  No, that’s not what I mean.  Patrick has been ke eping me up with his snoring.

Stevie:  I’ll keep it in mind.  If I don’t get a good  night’s sleep soon, separate bedrooms will be the least of our problems!

# Hiring a Hitman

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 75: Hiring a Hitman.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 475.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  You can find some add itional courses in business and daily English there, along with a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Hiring a Hitman.”  It’s sort of a funny dialogue about a woman who wants to get rid of someone.  Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Gus:  Are you Shirley?

Shirley:  Yeah, thanks for agreeing to meet me here.  I’m told you’re the best sniper in the business and you can be discreet.  I need a hitman who can do a job, then make himself scarce.

Gus:  I’m your man.  Tell me about it.

Shirley:  There’s someone who’s been a thorn in my side, keeping me up at night, and it’s time to take him out.

Gus:  Taking care of problems is my specialty.  I’ll need a down payment now and the balance when I finish him off.  We shouldn’t m eet again, so I’ll tell you later where to make a drop.

Shirley:  All right.

Gus:  Good.  How will I be able to spot the target?

Shirley:  Here’s a picture.  He’s usually in the yard in t he afternoons.

Gus:  You want me to kill a dog?!

 Shirley:  Right, he’s my neighbor’s dog and he keeps me u p every night.  Is that a problem?

Gus:  You bet it is.  Who do you think I am?  People a re disposable, but dogs? They’re a man’s best friend.

Shirley:  Are you kidding me?  You won’t take the job?

Gus:  Nope, I won’t.  If you want to pay good money to take out a dog, then that’s your prerogative, but I have my standards!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Gus saying to Shirley, “Are you Shirley?”  They haven’t met before; they’re meeting for the first time.  Shir ley says, “Yeah, thanks for agreeing to meet me here.  I’m told you’re the best sn iper in the business and you can be discreet.”  A “sniper” (sniper) is someone who i s very good at using a gun and can shoot people from a far away distance very a ccurately.  So it’s a gunman (someone with a gun), or a gunwoman, who is ver y accurate.  The army and the police might have a sniper.  Shirley says to Gus I heard that, or I’m told that you can be discreet.  “Discreet” means to be able to  keep a secret very quietly, not tell anyone this information, not make your self noticeable.  Someone who is discreet keeps things to themselves – keeps things secr et.

Shirley says, “I need a hitman who can do a job, and the n make himself scarce.” A “hitman” is a person who is paid for killing other pe ople – illegally, of course. They are hired by people to kill other people; that is a hitman.  Shirley says, “I need a hitman who can do a job,” meaning who can get this particular killing done, and “then make himself scarce.”  “To make yourself scarce” is a phrasal verb meaning to disappear quickly, to be difficult to fi nd, to leave a place; that is making yourself scarce.  If somebody says, “Make yourself scarce,”  they mean get out of here, leave.

Gus says, “I’m your man,” a phrase we use to show that you ca n do what the other person wants you to do (someone who is going to hi re you).  For example, if someone says, “I’m looking for someone who is good with  cars,” and you’re a mechanic (you’re a person who fixes cars), you might say, “I’m your man.  You should hire me.”

Shirley says, “There’s someone who’s been a thorn in my sid e, keeping me up at night, and it’s time to take him out.”  “A thorn in your side” is something that is very annoying, very unpleasant, something that is painful  and won’t go away.

 Usually we use this expression to talk about a person who b others you or a situation that causes you pain or annoys you somehow.  A “t horn” (thorn) is something that you would find in a plant, or a flower  like a rose.  It’s like a needle, a small stick, that when you touch it, it hurts.  So, a th orn in your side is something that hurts you.  Shirley says that this person – t his someone has been keeping her up at night, meaning not allowing her to  sleep, “and,” she says, “it’s time to take him out.”  “To take someone out” is an in formal expression meaning to kill someone, to murder someone.

Well, this all sounds very serious!  Gus says, “Taking care of problems is my specialty.”  Your “specialty” is something that you do very we ll, something you’re very good at, something that you have made your profession – your job, your expertise.  Well, Gus says that taking care of problems is hi s specialty; in this case, getting rid of people.  He says, “I’ll need a down  payment now and the balance when I finish him off.”  A “down payment” (two  words) is money that you pay before some service is finished; usually it’s a certain pe rcentage of the total cost.  So if you’re going to get your house painted and  it’s going to cost you $4,000, the painter might tell you, “I need a down p ayment of 25%.  You need to pay me $1,000 before I start.”  This is a down payment.  Gus wants a down payment and the balance when he finishes him off.  The  “balance” is, here, the rest of the money that you have to pay someone.  So in t he case of the painter, it would be the other $3,000.  The expression “to finish someone off” also means to kill someone; it’s the same as “taking someone out.”  “To finish off” means, here, just to kill someone.

Gus says, “We shouldn’t meet again, so I’ll tell you later  where to make a drop.” “To make a drop means to put money or something else very valuable in a secret location so that someone else can come and get it later.   This is something you will see in the movies.  For example, if there’s a spy (som eone who is collecting information about another country), the person migh t have someone in that country that is helping them, that is giving them inform ation.  That person inside the country may put the documents or the other informati on in a place, say in a park, and then leave, and then the spy comes and picks up that information.  It can be used to talk about money; it can be used to talk a bout information or something else.

Shirley says, “All right,” meaning okay.  Gus says, “Good.  How will I be able to spot the target?”  “To spot (something)” means to see an d identify, to find something.  If there’s a big crowd of people – lots of people, and you’re looking for one person you might say to your friend, “I can’t spot  her,” and then when you see her you say, “Oh, I’ve spotted her now.”  So it mea ns to look, to see, and identify: say, “Oh, yeah.  That’s the one.”  The “target ” is someone or something

 that you are looking for.  We often use that word when  we are going to attack that thing – we’re going to shoot that thing, that can also  be a target.  “Target” has a couple of different meanings in English, so take a loo k at the Learning Guide for some more explanation on that.

Gus says, “How will I be able to spot the target?”  Shir ley says, “Here’s a picture. He’s usually in the yard in the afternoons.”  The “yard”  here refers to the back or the front of the house where there is grass.  We talk about the “front yard” and the “back yard.”  The front yard is the space in front of your house that is part of your property, and the back yard is the space behind it.

Gus says, “You want me to kill a dog?!”  Shirley has given him a picture of the target, and the target is a dog that she wants to have killed.  Shirley says, “Right, he’s my neighbor’s dog and he keeps me up every night.  Is that a problem?” meaning are you okay with that, does that mean you don’t  want to kill him for me. Gus says, “You bet it is,” meaning yes, it is a problem.  “ Who do you think I am?” meaning what kind of person do you think I am.  “Peop le are disposable, but dogs?  They’re a man’s best friend.”  Something that is “disposable” is something that you can throw it away.  Usually we use this word to t alk about a thing, something you use once and then you throw it away, or som ething that is very inexpensive and cheap.  He says that people are disposable,  meaning well, it’s okay to get rid of people but not dogs.  He says they’re man’s best friend, which is an old expression: “A dog is a man’s best friend.”

Shirley says, “Are you kidding me (are you joking)?  You  won’t take the job (you won’t do it)?”  Gus says, “Nope (which is an informal of  saying no), I won’t.”  He says, “If you want to pay good money to take out a dog, th en that’s your prerogative, but I have my standards!”  “To pay good mon ey” here means to spend a lot of money for a specific thing, especially when  someone doesn’t think it’s a good idea.  You may say, “I don’t know why he pays good money to buy that old car.”  You’re saying he’s paying too much money or a lot of money for something that he shouldn’t be paying for.  Gus says, “If you want to pay good money to take out (to kill) a dog, then that’s your prer ogative.”  “Your prerogative” is your choice, your decision.  It’s often used when someone is not in agreement with you; they say, “Well, that’s your prerogative.”  Tha t usually means I don’t agree with your choice, but that’s your choice, you can do  that if you want.

Gus says that he has his standards.  Here, “standards” means rules that you follow that tell you what is right and wrong, what is good and bad.  They are principles or rules that you believe in and you try to fol low in your life.  “Standard” has a couple of meanings in English however, so once again , take a look at that Learning Guide for some more explanations.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gus:  Are you Shirley?

Shirley:  Yeah, thanks for agreeing to meet me here.  I’m told you’re the best sniper in the business and you can be discreet.  I need a hitman who can do a job, then make himself scarce.

Gus:  I’m your man.  Tell me about it.

Shirley:  There’s someone who’s been a thorn in my side, keeping me up at night, and it’s time to take him out.

Gus:  Taking care of problems is my specialty.  I’ll need a down payment now and the balance when I finish him off.  We shouldn’t m eet again, so I’ll tell you later where to make a drop.

Shirley:  All right.

Gus:  Good.  How will I be able to spot the target?

Shirley:  Are you kidding me?  You won’t take the job?

Gus:  Nope, I won’t.  If you want to pay good money to take out a dog, then that’s your prerogative, but I have my standards!

# Taking Chances in Business

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 76: Taking Chances in Business.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 476.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, it will help you improve your English even faste r.

This episode is called “Taking Chances in Business.”  It’s a st ory that uses a lot of common vocabulary – business vocabulary in talking about investing and risking your money.  Let’s get started. > I’ve always been a pretty cautious investor.  I like my investm ents to be conservative and I usually invest only in sure things.  Recentl y, though, I’ve been tempted to take more risk.
> My friend, Bernie, is a very successful fund manager and he  is willing to let me get in on one of his schemes.  According to Bernie, he ha s a way to take advantage of the current economic climate so that he and  his investors aren’t susceptible to the same market forces affecting other investo rs.  Barring any significant changes to the current economy, I should be raki ng it in before the end of the year.
> Bernie isn’t someone who shoots from the hip, so if he sa ys that this investment is going to be profitable, who am I to ask questions?  I’m very tempted to throw caution to the wind and to take a chance.  After all, it’s only money, right?

I begin our story by saying that I’ve always been a pretty ca utious investor. Someone who is “cautious” is someone who is careful, someon e who doesn’t take a lot of risks.  An “investor” is someone who buys some so rt of stock or bond or a financial instrument that allows you to make more m oney.  You can also invest in a business, you can invest in buying a building; t here are many different ways of being an investor.

 I say that I like my investments to be conservative and I only invest in sure things.  When we talk about an investment being “conservat ive,” we mean it is an investment with very little risk: something that is not risky,  something that will not likely lose money.  A “sure thing” is something that is gua ranteed to succeed, something that cannot go wrong, cannot fail.  The word  “sure” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

“Recently, though,” I say, “I’ve been tempted to take mor e risk.”  To “tempt” someone is to make someone want to do something because it seems like a good thing.  If you see a very nice apple pie, somethin g that looks good to eat, you might say, “That pie is very tempting.”  It is tempti ng me; it makes me want to do something.  I’ve been tempted recently to take more risks.  A “risk” is a possibility that something bad might happen.  So it’s som ething that you do that could turn out to be good, it could turn out to be bad.

My friend Bernie is a very successful fund manager.  A “fu nd manager” is a person whose job it is to invest money for other people, to find ways of making money for other people.  This friend of mine, Bernie,  is willing to let me get in on one of his schemes.  “To get in on (something)” is to b ecome involved or to participate in something, especially something that isn’t  available to everyone and is just beginning.  “To get in on the ground floo r” is another expression similar to this, meaning to be part of something from the very beginning, especially some sort of business venture.  If you were sma rt and you bought stock in Google when they first went public – when they fi rst started selling stock, you got in on the ground floor; you got there at the beginning and benefited from their increasing wealth.  “To get in” has a couple of m eanings, however, in English, so be sure to take a look at the Learning Guide  for some additional explanations.  A “scheme” (scheme) is a plan to do somethi ng, especially a secret plan, a plan that might require a lot of thoug ht and creativity.  It’s often used in a negative way, however, but here it’s being use d as a positive thing.

According to Bernie, he has a way to take advantage of t he current economic climate.  “To take advantage of” is an interesting expre ssion here, because it can have two meanings.  One is, simply, a positive meaning, me aning to use an opportunity to do something: “I’m going to take advant age of the low prices for houses to buy a new home.”  You are taking that opportu nity and using it.  “To take advantage of someone (or something)” can also have a  negative meaning, meaning that you are doing something bad to that pers on, someone who is in a difficult situation or a situation that makes them weak o r open to attack, you are taking advantage of their weakness.  So, it can have both a positive and negative meaning.

 Bernie says he has a way to take advantage of the current e conomic climate. “Climate” normally refers to the weather, but it can a lso be used more generally to describe the current situation – the current condition , so “economic climate” here means the economic situation.  Bernie has a way to t ake advantage of the current (the present) economic climate so that he and hi s investors aren’t susceptible to the same market forces affecting other investo rs.  “To be susceptible” (susceptible) means to be affected by something in a negative way; “to be vulnerable” is another way of saying this.  For exa mple if you are very old and sick, you are susceptible to the flu.  You might be m ore damaged by – more hurt by a simple illness; you are susceptible.

The investors for Bernie’s scheme are not going to be susce ptible, he says, to the same market forces affecting other investors.  The “m arket” refers to the larger economy; it can also refer specifically to the sto ck market, which is a special place for buying and selling parts of ownership i n companies, what we call stocks.  “Forces” means influences, things that are aff ecting other things. So, “market forces” is the way that the market – the eco nomy interacts and affects prices and sales of things; “market forces” refers to the economic influences.

I say, “Barring any significant changes to the current econ omy, I should be raking it in before the end of the year.”  “Barring” means u nless something occurs or happens, unless something is true.  For example: “Barring  rain, they’ll have an outdoor wedding.”  That means if it doesn’t rain – assu ming it doesn’t rain. “Barring” is followed by whatever situation is going to cause a change or would cause a change in your plans: unless this happens.  “Barring  any changes in the economy, we are going to have a difficult year this year ( unless the economy changes, we are going to have a difficult year this year). ”  I say that barring any significant changes to the current economy, meaning unless some things change significantly, I should be raking it in before the end of the year.  To “rake (rake) it in” is an expression that means to make a lot of money ver y easily.  A “rake,” as a noun, is a tool that you use, for example, to gather leaves that fall off a tree. “To rake it in,” however, means to make a lot of money.

“Bernie isn’t someone who shoots from the hip,” I say.  T he expression “to shoot from the hip” means to be spontaneous, to do somethin g without thinking about it, without planning it.  It’s often used to refer to  someone who might talk without actually thinking, without knowing the answer, without co nsidering it seriously.  I say that Bernie is not someone who shoots from the hip, m eaning he’s someone who thinks about it, who doesn’t talk about something un less he knows about it. So if he says that this investment is going to be profitab le, who am I to ask

 questions?  Something that is “profitable” is something  that is going to make money, something that will have a very good economic eff ect.  I say that Bernie says this investment is going to be profitable, so who am I  to ask questions, meaning I should not doubt Bernie because I don’t know  as much as he does.

Finally I say, “I’m very tempted to throw caution to the  wind and to take a chance.”  The expression “to throw caution to the wind” means to stop being careful, not to be cautious, to take a risk.  “To take a chance” means to take a risk, to do something risky.  I am very tempted to throw c aution to the wind – to be not cautious, and to take a chance with Bernie’s scheme.   “After all,” I say, “it’s only money, right?” meaning it’s no big deal if I  lose a little money.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal spe ed. > I’ve always been a pretty cautious investor.  I like my investm ents to be conservative and I usually invest only in sure things.  Recentl y, though, I’ve been tempted to take more risk.
> My friend, Bernie, is a very successful fund manager and he  is willing to let me get in on one of his schemes.  According to Bernie, he ha s a way to take advantage of the current economic climate so that he and  his investors aren’t susceptible to the same market forces affecting other investo rs.  Barring any significant changes to the current economy, I should be raki ng it in before the end of the year.
> Bernie isn’t someone who shoots from the hip, so if he sa ys that this investment is going to be profitable, who am I to ask questions?  I’m very tempted to throw caution to the wind and to take a chance.  After all, it’s only money, right?

# Planning a Gourmet Meal

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 77: Planning a Gourmet Meal.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 477.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even fast er.

This episode is called “Planning a Gourmet Meal.”  Some thing that is “gourmet” is something that is very good food, something that is very sophisticated food. This will be a dialogue between Hung and Padma that will use a lot of vocabulary related to eating good food.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Hung:  I can’t believe that the famous food critic, Julia  Schilds, will be eating in my restaurant tomorrow night.  I need to prepare a go urmet menu that’s going to be mind-blowing.

Padma:  She wouldn’t be coming here if she didn’t al ready know that your cuisine is considered some of the best food in the city.

Hung:  That may be so, but you’re only as good as your la st meal.  I need to think of some delicacies that will really impress her.  Let’s see,  I think we should offer two new hors d’oeuvres, in addition to the ones alrea dy on the menu.

Padma:  Are you sure the chefs in the kitchen will be abl e to handle making six different hors d’oeuvres?

Hung:  Hmm, maybe not.

Padma:  Why don’t you concentrate on the entrées?  I’m su re you could come up with one or two new dishes that will really impress her .

Hung:  Okay, but I don’t want to put all of my eggs in one basket.  I need to have dishes in every course that are out of this world.

Padma:  Come on.  You’re a great chef.  What’s the w orst she could say?

 Hung:  Lots of things.  She could say that this is a run- of-the-mill restaurant with mediocre food that she wouldn’t even feed to her cat!

Padma:  Okay, yes, she could  say those things but she won’t.  Your food will be mouthwatering and delectable, and her taste buds will thank you for it!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Hung saying, “I can’t believe that the famous food critic, Julia Schilds, will be eating in my restaurant tomorrow night.”  A “food critic” is a person who tastes food at restaurants and then writes abo ut it for a newspaper, a magazine, or, nowadays, a website.  A “critic,” in genera l, is someone who gives their opinion about things.  There are book critics, the re are film critics; this is a food critic.  Hung says, “I need to prepare a gourmet me nu that’s going to be mind-blowing.”  “Gourmet” (gourmet) is very good food,  made with the best ingredients, the best cooking techniques.  The expression “ to be mind-blowing” means to be amazing and surprising, to be very, very good.  Something that is mind-blowing may also simply be something that is difficu lt to understand because it is so shocking, so surprising, so unusual.  Here, it means excellent, something that is very good.

Padma says that this food critic would not be coming here if she didn’t know that your cuisine is considered some of the best food in the cit y.  “Cuisine” (cuisine) is excellent food.  It’s usually a type of food from a parti cular region or area. Padma is saying that your cuisine – your food is some of the  best food in the city. Hung says, “That may be so (meaning maybe), but you’re onl y as good as your last meal.”  This expression, “you’re only as good as your l ast (something),” is a phrase used to show that it doesn’t matter how many ti mes you do something well, people will only remember the most recent thing .  So if you’re a great cook and you cook many excellent meals, but then you cook a very bad meal, people will remember the last thing they ate, which was a bad meal.  So you have to keep performing at a high level, you always have to be go od; people won’t remember the good things you did in the past.

Hung says, “I need to think of some delicacies that will r eally impress her.”  A “delicacy” is a food that is very good tasting; something d elicious, but it is not very common, usually because it’s very expensive or it’s difficu lt to make.  Hung then says, “I think we should offer two new hors d’oeuvres,  in addition to the ones already on the menu.”  An “hors d’oeuvre” is anoth er French word – many of these terms come from French – that means something you eat before the

 main meal, what we typically say in English is an appetize r.  It’s a small amount of food that you eat before the main course – the main  meal.

Padma says, “Are you sure the chefs in the kitchen will be a ble to handle making six different hors d’oeuvres?”  The “chef” is the person wh ose job it is to cook in a restaurant, the person who cooks the food.  Many restaur ants have several different chefs working in the kitchen.  Padma is asking: “Are you sure the chefs in the kitchen will be able to handle (will be able t o manage) making six different hors d’oeuvres?”  Hung says, “Hmm, maybe not.”  Padma the n suggests: “Why don’t you concentrate on the entrées?”  The “entrée” i s the main course – the main part of the meal.  She’s suggesting to Hung that he worry about the entrée (the main part of the meal) the most.  She says, “I’m sure you could come up with (I’m sure you could think of) one or two new dishes that will really impress her.” A “dish,” here, is some particular food that’s usually par t of the larger meal.

Hung says, “Okay, but I don’t want to put all of my eggs in one basket.”  This is an old expression; “to put all of your eggs in one basket”  means to put all of your effort, your energy, your money, or your time into one project – one thing.  If that thing fails, then you don’t have anything else.  So it’ s investing all of your time and energy into one thing hoping that that one thing  will be successful.  Of course, if that one thing is not successful, then you will fail completely; you won’t have any other choices – any other options.  Hung is saying that he doesn’t want to put all of his emphasis into just one course – one pa rt of the meal.  He says, “I need to have dishes in every course that are out of this world” – I need to have types of food (specific preparations of food) in every course , meaning in every part of the meal.  The appetizer or hors d’oeuvre, the  soup or salad, the entree, the dessert; those are all courses.  Each part of that m eal – each course of that meal has to have dishes that are out of this world.  The  expression “out of this world” means incredibly good, very, very good, excellent.

Padma says, “Come on.  You’re a great chef.  What’s the worst she could say?” meaning you’re a good cook, you’re a good chef, she is n ot going to have anything very negative to say about your food.  Hung says, h owever, “Lots of things,” meaning there are lots of negative things she co uld say, “She could say that this is a run-of-the-mill restaurant.”  The expressi on “run-of-the-mill” (mill) means ordinary, normal, not very interesting.  You may sa y, “This is a run-of-the- mill hotel.”  It’s a normal hotel, it isn’t a bad hot el, but it isn’t a great hotel; it’s an average hotel, something that you would expect from thi s particular place or at this particular price.  It isn’t unique; it isn’t intere sting.  Hung says that the food critic could say that this is a run-of-the-mill restaurant  with mediocre food that she wouldn’t even feed to her cat.  “Mediocre” means avera ge, not very good, nothing special about it.  Mediocre food would be not very good food that,

 perhaps, you would give to an animal, which is really, of  course, a very negative thing to say – unless the food really is bad, like my cookin g for example!

Padma says, “Okay, yes, she could  say those things but she won’t.  Your food will be mouthwatering and delectable, and her taste b uds will thank you for it!” Something that is “mouthwatering” is something that ma kes you more hungry because it is so good tasting; it is so delicious it makes you  want to eat even more.  “Delectable” means delicious, very good, very pleasan t.  Finally, “taste buds” (buds) are the small spots on your tongue that al low you to taste or sense the flavor, whether it’s sweet or salty, bitter or sour.  Those are your taste buds on your tongue.  She says, “her taste buds will thank you f or it!” meaning they’ll consider it very good food – she’ll consider it, of course, very good food.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hung:  I can’t believe that the famous food critic, Julia  Schilds, will be eating in my restaurant tomorrow night.  I need to prepare a go urmet menu that’s going to be mind-blowing.

Padma:  She wouldn’t be coming here if she didn’t al ready know that your cuisine is considered some of the best food in the city.

# Having Plumbing Problems

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 78 – Having Plumbing Problems.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 478.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  The Learning Guide will help you improve your  English even faster.

This episode is called “Having Plumbing Problems.”  It’s a  dialogue between Mickey and Colleen, and uses a lot of vocabulary that you would associate with plumbing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mickey:  Hello, McQuillan Plumbing.

Colleen:  Hi, I’m having a lot of plumbing problems.  Can you send a plumber out to my house right away?

Mickey:  Yes, we can.  But first, let’s find out what the problems are.

Colleen:  Well, to start, my toilet won’t flush and it ’s overflowing.

Mickey:  An overflowing toilet – check.  What else?

Colleen:  The sink in the bathroom is stopped up and the pipes underneath the sink are leaking.

Mickey:  A stopped up sink and leaking pipes – check.  What el se?

Colleen:  The garbage disposal in the kitchen is making f unny noises and the water won’t drain.

Mickey:  A busted garbage disposal – check.  Is that all?

Colleen:  No, the faucet in the shower is stuck and I can’t shut off the water.

Mickey:  A stuck faucet – got it.  What else?

 Colleen:  That’s it.

Mickey:  You’ve got some really big problems there.

Colleen:  Yes, I know.  That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.  Can you send someone out right away?

Mickey:  Sure, no problem.  How about next Tuesday?

Colleen:  Next Tuesday?!  Didn’t you hear me?  These are emergencies!

Mickey:  Yes, but all of our plumbers are booked up unti l next Tuesday.  Should I put you down for a morning appointment?

Colleen:  Forget it!  By next Tuesday, I’ll be under 10  feet of water!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Mickey answering the phone: “He llo, McQuillan Plumbing.”  Colleen says, “Hi, I’m having a lot of plum bing problems.” “Plumbing” is a general term we use to talk about the water that moves through a building, especially in long metal tubes.  Sometimes the  water is moving into the building – the clean water, the dirty water is moving out of the building.  Both of these are part of your plumbing.  Colleen says, “Can you  send a plumber out to my house right away?”  A “plumber” is the person who fi xes problems with your plumbing.  She is asking Mickey to send a plumber out to h er house, meaning to send the plumber to where she lives.  Mickey says, “Yes, we can .  But first, let me find out what the problems are.”  Colleen says, “We ll, to start (meaning the first thing is), my toilet won’t flush and it’s overflow ing.”  Your “toilet” is a large, usually white thing in the bathroom that has a large hole on the top of it where you sit to get rid of things that are inside your body –  I think you understand! “Flush” is to move water through something to clean it, especially a toilet.  So after you finish using the toilet, you flush the toilet  – you use water to take that out of the pipes and out of your building or house.  “ Flush” actually has a couple of different meanings in English, so be sure to take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Colleen says the toilet is overflowing.  “To overflow” me ans to have water coming over the top of something and out of it because there ’s too much water.  If you have a toilet or a sink that is overflowing when you turn  the water on, that usually means that there is something blocking or preventing the water from escaping.

 Colleen says that her toilet is overflowing; Mickey says, “An  overflowing toilet – check.”  The word “check” here is used to show that you heard  and understood what the other person has said, often because you are ma king a list of something.  It’s a little informal, but Mickey is trying t o indicate to Colleen that he’s taking notes and he’s making a list of her problems.   Colleen says, “The sink in the bathroom is stopped up and the pipes underneath  the sink are leaking.” The “sink” (sink) is a large open container that holds w ater.  It’s used in bathrooms and in kitchens to clean things.  In the bathr oom, it is used to clean your face and your hands; in the kitchen, it’s used for clea ning dishes and so on. “Sink” has a couple of meanings in English, however, so a gain, take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

“The sink in the bathroom is stopped up,” Colleen says.  “To stop up” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to become blocked, to stop worki ng properly, especially something like a pipe or a tube that water or  liquid is going through. Another word we use for this is “clog” (clog).  If someon e says the pipes that are below the sink, the tubes that come from the sink and le ad the water out of your house, are “clogged,” they mean that they are stopped up , there is something in them that is preventing the water from moving and flo wing, we would say, freely. “Pipes,” as I just mentioned, are long, hard, either p lastic or metal tubes that you use to move a liquid or a gas through.  In this case, it ’s for the water.  Colleen says that the pipes underneath (below) the sink are leakin g.  Something that is “leaking” is something that has water coming out of it,  usually very slowly.  If you have a roof on your house that is leaking, that means th at there is water coming through it.  Another word we use is “leaky” (leaky), which  is the adjective.

Mickey then repeats back to Colleen what she said to indicat e that he has understood.  He says, “A stopped up sink and leaking pipes – check.  What else?”  Colleen says, “The garbage disposal in the kitchen is making funny noises and the water won’t drain.”  The “garbage dispo sal” is a small machine that is underneath, or below, your sink that cuts up food  into very small pieces so that it will fit in the pipes and be washed away wit h the water down the pipe. “Garbage” is another general word meaning the same as “trash,” things that you don’t want anymore and are throwing out.  Here, the garbage is going to be food that you don’t want anymore.  “To dispose of (something) ” means to get rid of something, so the garbage disposal is the machine that he lps you get rid of the unwanted food that you didn’t eat or simply didn’t wan t.  Colleen says the garbage disposal is making “funny noises,” meaning it’s maki ng a noise that is not usual.  She also says the water won’t drain.  “To dr ain” means to make the water go through something or away from something.  In  this case, the water is going to go from the sink into the pipes and then out of your house.  Mickey then

 says, “A busted garbage disposal – check.”  “Busted” is an inf ormal word indicating broken, not working properly.

Colleen says that the faucet in the shower is stuck and she can’t shut off the water.  The “faucet” is a little piece of metal above the sink or the bathtub that water flows through.  It’s a place where you can turn t he water on and off – you can start the water moving out of the pipe or stop it from moving out of the pipe. So, faucets are for the water coming into your house.  T his faucet is “stuck,” meaning it won’t move.  When something is stuck you can’t  change its position, you can’t move it.  “To shut off” is a phrasal verb meanin g to turn something off, to stop something from continuing.  A parent might say t o his son or daughter, “Turn off the television,” meaning stop watching the TV  – unplug it or turn off the switch.  A wife may say that to her husband, who’s watching  baseball instead of paying attention to her, “Shut off the TV.”  Colleen  wants to shut off the water, meaning she wants to stop the water from flowing out of the faucet.

Mickey says, “A stuck faucet – got it,” which is the same as “I understand it,” or as we said earlier, “check.”  “What else?” he asks.  Colleen  says, “That’s it (that’s all, there are no more problems).”  Mickey says, “You’ve got some really big problems there.”  Colleen says, “Yes, I know.”  She says, “C an you send someone out right away (can you have someone come to my ho use immediately)?”  Mickey says, “Sure, no problem.  How abou t next Tuesday?” Colleen says, “Next Tuesday?!  Didn’t you hear me?  Thes e are emergencies (these are things that I need to have fixed today)!”  M ickey says, “Yes, but all of our plumbers are booked up until next Tuesday.”  To be “ booked up” means to be unavailable because your schedule is full; you already h ave other appointments.  If you’re sick and you call your doctor, the  secretary may tell you that the doctor is booked up today.  This happens a lot o n Mondays, so you should try not to be sick on Monday!

In this case, Mickey’s plumbers are booked up until next Tuesd ay; they don’t have any free time to go over to Colleen’s house.  Colle en says, “Forget it!  By next Tuesday, I’ll be under 10 feet of water!”  “I’ll  be under 10 feet of water” means that because of the plumbing being broken, her ho use will be filled with water if she waits to fix it until next Tuesday.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mickey:  Hello, McQuillan Plumbing.

 Colleen:  Hi, I’m having a lot of plumbing problems.  Can you send a plumber out to my house right away?

# Using Frequent Flyer Miles

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 79: Using Frequent Flyer Miles.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 479.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes, and a complete transcript of this episode.

This episode is called “Using Frequent Flyer Miles.”  These  are special bonuses or awards that airlines give you for flying on their ai rplanes.  It’s a dialogue between Anne and Jurgen using some vocabulary we use to ta lk about this special program.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anne:  Where were you this past weekend?  I tried callin g you on Friday to see if you wanted to go to the movies with me.

Jurgen:  I was in Chicago for a long weekend.

Anne:  Chicago?  I didn’t know you were planning a tr ip.  I thought you were pretty strapped this month.  A ticket to Chicago would set  you back at least $300.

Jurgen:  I am pretty strapped, but I wanted to go to my friend Rachel’s wedding. I was able to use my frequent flyer miles to get a ticket.   I was lucky that those weren’t blackout dates.

Anne:  Oh, that explains it.  You’ve been traveling a lot using your frequent flyer miles.  How do you rack up so many miles?  I’m enrolled i n the frequent flyer programs of three different airlines, but I never seem to have enough miles to redeem them for a ticket or even an upgrade.

Jurgen:  The trick is to get a credit card that gives you m iles.  For every dollar I charge on my credit card, I get one mile.  Since I use my credit card for a lot of business purchases, the miles add up pretty quickly.  I also use  a lot of the hotels

 and restaurants that partner with the airlines, and do ing that gives me bonus miles.

Anne: Aren’t there a lot of restrictions?  Do you ever have problems redeeming the miles?

Jurgen:  Yeah, there are some restrictions, but I work ar ound them.  There are fewer restrictions if you have elite status, but I’m a l ong way from that.

Anne:  So I need to get a credit card that gives me fre quent flyer miles.

Jurgen:  Yeah, but a word to the wise:  spend carefully.   You don’t want to rack up credit card debt for the sake of racking up frequent  flyer miles!

Anne:  Point taken.  Thanks for the tip.

[end of dialogue]

Anne begins our dialogue by asking, “Where were you this past weekend?  I tried calling you on Friday to see if you wanted to go to the  movies with me.”  Jurgen explains, “I was in Chicago for a long weekend.”  A “l ong weekend” is usually a period of three days, maybe four days: Friday, Saturday, S unday, Monday or Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Americans like to have  their holidays on a Monday; that gives them a long weekend.  They get Saturd ay, Sunday, and Monday to rest from work.

So Jurgen was in Chicago, that’s why he couldn’t go with Anne to the movies last weekend.  Anne says, “Chicago?  I didn’t know you were pl anning a trip.  I thought you were pretty strapped this month.”  “To be st rapped” (strapped) means to not have any money, to have very little money, w e might also say “to be broke.”  “Strap” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Anne says, “A ticket to Chicago would set you back at least $ 300.”  “To set (someone) back” means that it cost a certain amount of mon ey, it’s the amount of money you have to pay.  It’s sort of an odd expression, for  example: “This computers set me back $1,000.”  That means the computer co st $1,000.  We usually use this expression when we are trying to indicate that it’s a lot of money: “I once bought a girlfriend a diamond necklace, it set me back $500.”  After I gave her the necklace, of course, she broke up with me and  kept the necklace; the lesson here is be careful before giving your girlfrie nd expensive jewelry!

 Anne says that a ticket to Chicago would set you back at lea st $300.  Jurgen says, “I am pretty strapped, but I wanted to go to my fri end Rachel’s wedding.  I was able to use my frequent flyer miles to get a ticket.”   “Frequent” means often; “flyer” is somebody who flies in an airplane.  In this ca se, a “frequent flyer” is someone who uses airplanes a lot – who travels a lot.  Many airline companies – many airlines have special programs were you can earn wha t they call “miles,” points for each trip that you take, and the more trips you take the more miles you get.  Eventually, if you get 20,000 or 30,000 miles you  can get a free trip.

So, Jurgen is saying that he had flown a lot before; h e had these frequent flyer miles, sort of like a coupon, that he could use to get a  ticket for free to Chicago. Jurgen says, “I was lucky that those weren’t blackout dates.”  In most airline programs they give you these miles that you can “redeem, ” or use to get a ticket, however there are certain days that they will not allow you to use your frequent flyer miles.  Usually these are around holidays when every one wants to fly, it’s very popular so you can’t use your miles on very popular da ys.  “Blackout” is when you are not allowed to do something or see somethi ng; “blackout dates” are dates that you can’t use your frequent flyer mile cou pons.  A “blackout” can also mean when there is no power, for example the elect ricity goes out in your house, and it goes out in the entire city.  That would  be called a “blackout.” “Blackout” can also mean if you’ve drunk too much and you do n’t remember what happened yesterday while you were drinking.  This doesn’t  happen to me – frequently!

Anne says, “Oh, that explains it (that explains why you wer e able to go to Chicago).”  She says, “You’ve been traveling a lot using your frequent flyer miles. How do you rack up so many miles?”  “To rack up” is a two-w ord phrasal verb meaning to get a lot of something, usually by adding a  little bit at a time over a long period of time.  For example, if you have a li brary book that you don’t return on time, and you do this for several months, you borrow the book and then you don’t return it, the library charges you a “fine,” a fe e, a penalty you have to pay, you could say, “I’ve racked up $1,000 in library fines.”  An other word would be “accumulated.”

So, Anne is asking Jurgen how he racked up – how he accumu lated so many miles.  She says, “I’m enrolled in the frequent flyer pr ograms of three different airlines.”  “To be enrolled” means that you are parti cipating in something, you sign up or register for something and you are part of t hat program.  We often use this verb in talking about going to college: “I’m enrol led at the university (I am a student and I am going to classes at the university).”  Ann e says that she never seems to have enough miles to redeem them for a ticket or  even an upgrade. “To redeem” means to give something in exchange for somet hing else, usually

 points or coupons, something that is worth money that you  can give in order to get something back.  In this case, you are redeeming your frequent flyer miles to get a ticket on that airline.  An “upgrade” is an incre ase or an improvement from one thing or one level to another thing or another l evel.  With frequent flyer mile programs you can sometimes buy a ticket for a certain seat,  and then upgrade to a higher class – a better seat: a business class or a first class seat.  Airplanes have what they call “economy seats,” these are the cheap se ats, they’re also called “coach (coach) seats,” and then they have the bigge r, nicer, roomier seats that are business class and first class.  So an upgrade woul d be going from, for example, a coach class ticket to a first class ticket.

Jurgen says, “The trick (or the special way to do this) is to  get a credit card that gives you miles.  For every dollar I charge on my credit card , I get one mile. Since I use my credit card for a lot of business purchases,  the miles add up pretty quickly.”  “To add up” means to increase; it’s simil ar to “to rack up.”  “To add up” means things get bigger and bigger, usually slo wly over time.  So what Jurgen is saying here is that many airlines have agreements or partnerships with credit card companies, when you use your credit card you get  one mile, usually, for every dollar that you spend.  And since Jurgen uses hi s credit card for business expenses, he has a lot of expenses on his credit card –  a lot of charges, and he gets miles for all of those.  This is a ve ry popular program.  I do this with my credit card; I get miles for every time I buy something on my credit card.  Of course you still have to pay for it, it’s not f ree.

Jurgen says, “I also use a lot of hotels and restaurants that partner with the airlines, and doing that gives me bonus miles.”  “To par tner (as a verb) with someone” means to cooperate, to work closely with someone.  Again, there are restaurants that partner, or work with the airline comp anies, and they will give you miles for every dollar that you spend at their restaur ant.  “To get bonus miles” means to get extra, or additional, miles.  “Bonu s” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

Anne asks Jurgen, “Aren’t there a lot of restrictions?”  “Restrictions” are limitations, things that you are not allowed to do.  She says, “Do you ever have problems redeeming the miles?”  Jurgen says, “Yeah, ther e are some restrictions, but I work around them.”  “To work around (something)” means to find a way to do what you want, even though you have re strictions or limitations. It means to be successful even though there are obstacles o r things that make it difficult for you to do what you want to do.  Jurgen sa ys, “There are fewer restrictions if you have elite status.”  “Elite status” is a  very high level in a program where you get a lot of additional benefits – a lot of additional things. The frequent flyer programs have different levels of me mbership.  If you fly a lot,

 for example 100,000 miles a year, you will often be put  into a higher category in the program, and you will get more from the program .

Anne says, “So I need to get a credit card that gives me frequent flyer miles.” Jurgen says, “Yeah, but a word to the wise.”  The expressi on “a word to the wise” means that you are going to give the person some advice: “Here is some advice.” He says, “a word to the wise: spend carefully.  You don’t want to rack up credit card debt for the sake of racking up frequent flyer miles! ”  Once again, that verb “to rack up” – to accumulate, to get a lot of.  He’s sayin g you don’t want to get a lot of credit card debt, money you owe to the bank, just  so that you can get more frequent flyer miles.  “For the sake of” means “in order  to.”

Finally, Anne says, “Point taken.”  “Point taken” is an e xpression that we use to mean I understand what you are saying, I agree with wh at you are telling me. “Point taken,” she says, “Thanks for the tip.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Anne:  Where were you this past weekend?  I tried callin g you on Friday to see if you wanted to go to the movies with me.

Jurgen:  I was in Chicago for a long weekend.

Anne:  Chicago?  I didn’t know you were planning a tr ip.  I thought you were pretty strapped this month.  A ticket to Chicago would set  you back at least $300.

Jurgen:  I am pretty strapped, but I wanted to go to my friend Rachel’s wedding. I was able to use my frequent flyer miles to get a ticket.   I was lucky that those weren’t blackout dates.

Anne:  Oh, that explains it.  You’ve been traveling a lot using your frequent flyer miles.  How do you rack up so many miles?  I’m enrolled i n the frequent flyer programs of three different airlines, but I never seem to have enough miles to redeem them for a ticket or even an upgrade.

Jurgen:  The trick is to get a credit card that gives you m iles.  For every dollar I charge on my credit card, I get one mile.  Since I use my credit card for a lot of business purchases, the miles add up pretty quickly.  I also use  a lot of the hotels and restaurants that partner with the airlines, and do ing that gives me bonus miles.

# Riding in a Carpool

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 80: Riding in a Carpool.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 480.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.

This episode is called “Riding in a Carpool.”  A “carpoo l” is when several people ride together in one car to go, usually, to work.  Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roberto:  Hey, Loreto.  Got a minute?

Loreto:  I’m going to a meeting off-site, but we can talk if you don’t mind walking me to my car.

Roberto:  Sure, okay.  I just wanted to ask if you’re i nterested in carpooling to work.  We only live a few blocks from each other.

Loreto:  Thanks for asking, but I’m not sure carpooling w ould work for me. Sometimes I run late in the morning and I wouldn’t want to hold you up.

Roberto:  We wouldn’t have to commute together every d ay, only on those days that are convenient for both of us.  Carpooling has its advantages, too.  In addition to doing our part for the environment, we co uld use the high-occupancy carpool lanes.  That’ll save time, especially if there’s a lot of traffic congestion.

Loreto:  Yeah, I guess that could cut down on our commu te time.

Roberto:  We also get preferential treatment for par king on the days we carpool.

Loreto:  How would it work?  Do we set up a schedule a nd take turns driving?

Roberto:  Why don’t I swing by and pick you up tomorrow morning and we can talk more about it?

 Loreto:  If you don’t mind picking me up en route, tha t would be great.  By the way, how do you know where I live?

Roberto:  Oh, I asked around.  See you tomorrow.

[end of dialogue]

Our episode begins with Roberto asking Loreto, “Hey, Lo reto.  Got a minute?” The word “hey,” nowadays, is sometimes used informally to say “hi” or “hello.” It’s a very informal use, however.  Roberto asks if Loreto  has got a minute, meaning do you have a short time to talk to me.  When so meone says, “Got a minute?” they mean I want to talk to you for a short am ount of time, is this a good time.

Loreto says, “I’m going to a meeting off-site, but we can talk if you don’t mind walking me to my car.”  “Off-site” means at a different location, not at your office in this case.  Loreto asks Roberto to walk her to her car.  “To walk (someone) to (somewhere)” means to accompany someone while they are wa lking; to walk alongside, we could say, that person – to walk with tha t person.

Roberto says, “Sure, okay.  I just wanted to ask you if you ’re interested in carpooling to work.”  “To carpool” means to share a car w ith two or more people who are going to the same place.  Usually carpooling rel ates to going to work, though you could carpool to a concert for example.  Norma lly, however, it refers to two or more people riding in the same car.  In man y cities in the United States there are what are called “carpool lanes” on the free ways or the highways. These are parts of the road that only two or more peop le riding in the same car may use.  It’s a way of encouraging people to not use as m uch energy, to cut down traffic – to reduce traffic by giving people a specia l lane on the freeway where they can drive if you have two or sometimes three o r more people.  These are very popular here in Los Angeles

Roberto says that he and Loreto only live a few blocks fro m each other, meaning they live very close to each other so it would makes sense for  them to drive to work together.  Loreto says, “Thanks for asking, but I’m no t sure carpooling would work for me.  Sometimes I run late in the morni ng and I wouldn’t want to hold you up.”  “To run late” means to be behind your sch edule, not to be on time, to do something later than you should.  Someone says, “I’ m running late,” they mean I have to go now, I am late for an appointment or I am behind my schedule. “Run” has many different meanings in English, as you prob ably know.  Take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

 “To hold (someone) up,” as in when Loreto says, “I don’t  want to hold you up,” means to delay someone, to do something so that the oth er person cannot get something done on time or as soon as he or she would l ike, to prevent someone from doing something on time or quickly.  “To hold (some one) up,” then, means to delay them.  Loreto was saying to Roberto sometimes I’ m late in the morning and I don’t want you to be late, too – I don’t want to hold you up.

Roberto says, “We wouldn’t have to commute together ever y day, only on those days that are convenient for both of us.”  “To commute”  means to go from your home to your office and then back again.  So, if Rober to and Loreto are going to carpool, they would be commuting from their homes to th eir office – assuming they work at the same office, which is normally the case.  I carpooled – and notice we use it as a verb, as well – when I was commuting  back in St. Paul, back in Minnesota when I live there many years ago.  When I was teaching high school, I would with carpool with one of the other lan guage teachers.  She was a German teacher, I believe.  That was commuting by using a carpool.  We only did that a couple of days a week, on the other days we d rove separately.

Roberto says, “Carpooling has its advantages, too.  In addition to doing our part for the environment, we could use the high-occupancy carp ool lanes.”  “To do your part” means to help something happen, to contribut e to something.  “We want everyone to do their part,” we want everyone to do  their share; we want everyone to do what they should do to help the larger group effort.  A “high- occupancy carpool lane” is what I was talking about earlier  when I mentioned carpool lanes; sometimes they’re called “high-occupancy.”  “O ccupancy” refers to how many people are there in a particular place or how  many people could fit in a particular place.  “High-occupancy” would be that you ha ve many people, in this case in your car.  The minimum is usually two people; somet imes the minimum to use these special carpool lanes is three people.  In some  states they’re called “HOV lanes,” where the “V” stands for vehicle, in this case  a car or a truck.  So, high-occupancy vehicle lanes or high-occupancy carpool lanes are  the same thing.

Roberto says, “That will save time (meaning using the car pool lanes will save time), especially if there’s a lot of traffic congestion. ”  The idea here is that carpool lanes have fewer cars in them become most people d rive themselves to work alone, so you can go faster in the carpool lane usua lly, especially if there is a lot of traffic congestion.  “Traffic congestion” is when  you have too many cars on the freeway or the highway, and it causes all of the  cars to move very slowly.

Loreto says, “Yeah, I guess that could cut down on our co mmute time.”  “To cut down on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to use l ess of something or to

 reduce something.  Loreto is saying that yes, they could get  to work faster if they used the carpool lanes.  Roberto says, “We also get prefe rential treatment for parking on the days we carpool.”  “Preferential treatme nt” is treating some people differently, being nicer to someone, or giving someon e special benefits that you don’t give other people.  In some companies, to encourag e employees to carpool, they will give good parking spots for their cars if you carpool.

Loreto then asks, “How would it work?  Do we set up a sch edule and take turns driving?”  “To take turns” means to do one thing after  another: I do something and then you do something.  Or if there are three of us, first I do something, then you do something, then the third person does something, and then I do something again, and so on, and so forth.  That is “taki ng turns,” each person gets a chance to do something after the other person.

Roberto says, “Why don’t I swing by and pick you up tomorro w morning and we can talk more about it?”  “To swing by,” when we’re ta lking about driving, means to go to a place for short period of time, especially so meone’s office or home to visit with that person.  In this case, Roberto is going t o swing by – going to drive to her house and pick her up; that is, take her with him  in his car.  Loreto says, “If you don’t mind picking me up en route, that would be g reat.”   “En route,” which is some times pronounced “en route” although the preferre d pronunciation is “en route” or  “en route,” is a French expression.  In Engli sh, we use it to mean “on the way,” on the path between where you are starting a nd where you end up.  So I go from my house, I stop and pick you up at your house,  and together we go to work – I pick you up en route to work.

Loreto then says, “By the way, how do you know where I li ve?”  Roberto answers, “Oh, I asked around.”  “To ask around” means to get a piece of information by asking many different people until you fi nd someone who knows the answer.  “I asked around about someone who could reco mmend a good movie to me this weekend” – I asked many different peopl e until I found someone who knew, who could give me that piece of information.   Why Roberto was asking around about where Loreto lives is a little strang e.  It’s a little, ah, perhaps something that Loreto needs to be careful about, this Roberto – I don’t know, I don’t trust him!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Roberto:  Hey, Loreto.  Got a minute?

 Loreto:  I’m going to a meeting off-site, but we can talk if you don’t mind walking me to my car.

Roberto:  Sure, okay.  I just wanted to ask if you’re i nterested in carpooling to work.  We only live a few blocks from each other.

# Listening to Music

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 81: Listening to Music.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 481 – can you believe it?  My name is Dr. Jeff McQuillan, I’m the host of ES L Podcast, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beaut iful – and I do mean beautiful – Los Angeles, California.

We have a website, yes we do.  It’s eslpod.com.  On it, you  can find a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your E nglish even faster.

This episode is a dialogue between Victoria and J.D.  It ’s going to talk about listening to music and uses a lot of vocabulary we use to d escribe music.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Victoria:  I see that you have a really extensive music colle ction.

J.D.:  Yeah, I like a lot of different genres of music.

Victoria:  Do you have the new J.McQ album?  He’s my favor ite artist.  I just got it and I like all of the tracks on it.

J.D.:  No, I haven’t heard it yet.  Do you have it on your MP3 player?

Victoria:  Yeah, here, I’ve cued up the first track.

J.D.:  Hmm…I like the beat of the first song, but I’m n ot blown away by the rest of it.  It’s also a really bad mix.  The bass is up too high ; you can hardly hear the treble.  Is the whole album like that?

Victoria:  Yeah, I guess so.  I didn’t notice.  Maybe the  volume wasn’t up high enough.

J.D.:  No, it was up high enough.  Maybe he’s just not t hat good a vocalist and the sound engineers are trying to cover it up in the mi xing.

Victoria:  Are you kidding?  He’s an amazing singer.  Co me on, listen to another track.  I’m sure you’ll change your mind.

 J.D.:  No, thanks.  I’d rather listen to a bunch of fi ghting cats than listen to anymore of J.McQ!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Victoria saying, “I see that you  have a really extensive music collection.”  “Extensive” means large, thorough, and complete, with many different kinds of something.  You might say to someone, “He has an extensive library,” it has lots of different books about lots of d ifferent topics.  A “collection” is just a group of things, so when Victoria says to J.D., “you  have a really extensive music collection,” she means he has a lot of albums, CDs, ot her recordings of music.

J.D. says, “Yeah, I like a lot of different genres of mu sic.”  A “genre of music” is a type or a style of music; it can also be used to describe a t ype or a style of book or of a movie – different genres of movies.  Notice that  the person’s name here is J.D., those are actually initials.  Usually they would stand  for something: the “J” could be John or James or even Jeff.  Sometimes people use  their initials as, effectively, their name, and that’s what J.D. is using her e.  I actually have a friend whose first and last initials are “J” and “D,” sometimes p eople would call him J.D.

Anyway, J.D. has a lot of different types of music.  Victor ia asks him, “Do you have the new J.McQ album?  He’s my favorite artist.”  An “album” is a group of songs on a single CD (or compact disc) or on what we used to call “records.” Well, they’re still called records; they’re not as popula r anymore, although some people still like them.  These were large black discs made out of vinyl.  An album is a collection of 8-10, maybe more songs from the same si nger or the same band.  The word “artist,” here, just means musician.  I t can be used to refer to someone who is a painter or a sculptor, but in talking about music it simply means the musician.

Victoria says that J.McQ is he favor artist, and I can under stand why – he’s got a great voice!  She says, “I just got it (meaning I just bou ght it; I just was able to obtain it) and I liked all of the tracks on it.”  A “tr ack” is one song on an album, or one song in a collection of music in this case.  “Track” actu ally has a couple of different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

J.D. says, “No, I haven’t heard it yet.  Do you have it on your MP3 player?” your iPod, for example.  Victoria says, “Yeah, here, I’ve cued up the first track.”  “To cue up (something)” means to make something ready to p lay, especially if you

 are talking about music or videos.  For example, if you ha ve a DVD player and you rent a movie – a DVD, your husband or wife might say , “I’ll cue up the movie while you make the popcorn.”  “To cue up” means to get it ready to play, because, of course, when you buy a DVD with a movie on it there’s usually of bunch of other commercials and other things before the  movie actually starts.

J.D. says, after listening to this song by J.McQ, he says, “Hmm …I like the beat of the first song, but I’m not blown away by the rest of it.”  The “beat” (beat), here refers to the rhythm, the repeating regular song when you have one note stronger or louder than the other.  There are a lot of very famous beats in popular music, sometimes you even hear the same beat in different types of music – or different songs, I should say.  Well, J.D. likes the beat  of the first song, but he was not blown away by the rest of it.  By the way, “beat”  has a couple of different meanings in English, so definitely take a look at our Lea rning Guide for some more explanations.  “To be blown away” means to have a very favorable impression of something, to like something very much, much m ore than you expected it.  “I went to see the movie Slumdog Milliona ire and I was blown away by it,” I thought was very good, much better than I expe cted.

Well, J.D. is not blown away by J.McQ’s first song; he says,  “It’s also a really bad mix.”  A “mix” is the combination of voices, instruments , music, as well as other sounds in a recorded song.  So, it’s the mixture of these different elements in the song.  J.D. says, “The bass is up too high, and I can hardly hear the treble.”  The “bass,” in music, are the low-pitched sounds – low, like th is.  That’s bass.  You can also use the word to describe a bass guitar, which is a guitar that plays these very low notes.  The opposite of “bass” is “treble.”  “Tr eble” refers to the high notes, like you might hear in a woman’s voice.

J.D. asks, “Is the whole album like that?” meaning are al l of the songs that way. Victoria says, “Yeah, I guess so.  I didn’t notice.  Maybe  the volume wasn’t up high enough.”  The “volume” refers to the loudness of m usic or sound.  She’s saying that she didn’t notice these problems because perha ps the volume wasn’t up high enough.  We talk about the volume being “high ” when it’s loud, and “low” when it’s soft.

J.D. says, “No, it was up high enough.  Maybe he’s not tha t good a vocalist and the sound engineers are trying to cover it up in the mi xing.”  A “vocalist” is someone who sings; it’s a singer.  The “sound engineers” a re the people who try to improve the recorded music before it is sold.  So the y record a singer, and then they do things to the recording to try to make it so und better.  Sometimes they do things that make the voice sound a lot better th an the person can actually sing, that way they cover up the problems.  “To cover (somet hing) up” is a

 phrasal verb meaning to do something so that no one else  can see it or hear it. So they cover up the bad singing by doing these other thi ngs.

Victoria is somewhat angry at J.D., she says, “Are you kiddin g (are you joking)? J.McQ is an amazing singer (a great singer).  Come on, li sten to another track. I’m sure you’ll change your mind,” you’ll have a differen t opinion of J.McQ.  J.D. says, “No, thanks.  I’d rather listen to a bunch of fighti ng cats than listen to anymore of J.McQ!”  Of course, fighting cats don’t sound very nice.  But I’m guessing here that J.D. is a musician and he is a little j ealous of J.McQ, because Victoria likes J.McQ’s music and J.D. is jealous; he wants to h ave all of the attention for himself.  I’m pretty sure that’s what’s h appening in this dialogue!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Victoria:  I see that you have a really extensive music colle ction.

J.D.:  Yeah, I like a lot of different genres of music.

Victoria:  Do you have the new J.McQ album?  He’s my favor ite artist.  I just got it and I like all of the tracks on it.

J.D.:  No, I haven’t heard it yet.  Do you have it on your MP3 player?

Victoria:  Yeah, here, I’ve cued up the first track.

J.D.:  Hmm…I like the beat of the first song, but I’m n ot blown away by the rest of it.  It’s also a really bad mix.  The bass is up too high ; you can hardly hear the treble.  Is the whole album like that?

Victoria:  Yeah, I guess so.  I didn’t notice.  Maybe the  volume wasn’t up high enough.

J.D.:  No, it was up high enough.  Maybe he’s just not t hat good a vocalist and the sound engineers are trying to cover it up in the mi xing.

Victoria:  Are you kidding?  He’s an amazing singer.  Co me on, listen to another track.  I’m sure you’ll change your mind.

J.D.:  No, thanks.  I’d rather listen to a bunch of fi ghting cats than listen to anymore of J.McQ!

# Talking About Architecture

Welcome to English as a Second La nguage Podcast number 482: Talking About Architecture.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 482.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our websi te is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Gui de for this episode, which will give you all of the vocabulary, defin itions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes, and a complete transcript of everything we  say on this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Iktinos and Pinda; th ey’re going to be talking about “architecture,” the way that we make buildings, i ncluding a lot of very common vocabulary to talk about buildings and houses.  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Iktinos:  I can’t believe we’re in one of the world’s mo st famous structures.  Look at this architecture!

Pinda:  Yeah, great, another old building.  I’m going to sit in that bay window and rest my feet while you walk around.

Iktinos:  Come on, come with me.  Just look at these columns and  beams. They’re over 2,000 years old!

Pinda:  Right, they’re old.  Everything we’ve seen these  past two weeks has been old.  What’s so special about this?

Iktinos:  Are you trying to tell me that you don’t thin k this dome is impressive?  It’s one of the largest in the world.  Look at those cornices and skylights.  I’ve never seen anything like them.

Pinda:  This building has a good facade, with nice bala nce and symmetry, but I’m so tired of look ing at the same style of building, one after another.   Aren’t we going to see anything else today?

Iktinos:  We are seeing some of the most important monum ents to human ingenuity.

I’ll stay here on this balcony.

Iktinos:  What are you going to do here?

Pinda:  I’m going to think about how I’d remodel the  building to bring it up to date.

Iktinos:  You’re hopeless!

[end of dialogue]

The dialogue begins with I ktinos saying, “I can’t believe we’re in one of the world’s most famous structures.”  A “structure” is a build ing or something that was made by human beings, something to work in or live in.  These are all considered structures: a house, a building are exa mples.  Iktinos says, “Look at this architecture!”  “Architecture” is the art and science of designing and creating new buildings.  There are many different types of archi tecture; historically, you can find many different varieties throughout the world.

Pinda says, “Yeah, great, another old building.”  Pinda  is not very excited about architecture.  She says, “I’m going to sit in that bay wi ndow and rest my feet while you walk around.”  A “bay window” is a large wind ow that pushes out through the wall of a building; it creates an area wh ere you can sit.  Normally, it’s like a semicircle that goes out from the side of the buil ding to the outside.  It’s a window, but it’s a window where you can sit down on and  look out or look in, depending on what’s more interesting.

Pinda is going to rest for a while.  Iktinos says, howeve r, “Come on, come with me.  Just look at these columns and beams,” he says.  A “colu mn” is a large piece of a building that goes from the floor to the ceiling.  Usually, it’s like a big, round tube; it’s circular.  It can be used to support the ceiling – support the top part of the building or the floor of the building a bove you.  Often a column is used, however, for decoration purposes; it looks nice.  The  most famous example of columns w ould be, perhaps, the Parthenon in Athens, the great temple on top of the Acropolis in Athens that is surrounded by columns.  And, of course, there are many columns in various buildings throughout the wo rld, especially in Western and European architecture.  A “beam” is a long piece of the building that goes from one side of the ceiling to the other.  So, a  column is vertical; a beam is horizontal, it goes from one side of the room to the o ther.  Again, it’s used to help support the roof or the upper floor of the building.   The word “beam” has several

These materials are copyrighted by the Center f or Educational Development (2009).  Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in  any way is prohibited. 7 different meanings, so take a look at the Learning Gui de for some additional explanations.

Iktinos says that the columns and beams are over 2,000 years o ld.  Pinda says, “Yeah, right, they’re old.  Everything we’ve seen these p ast two weeks has been old.  What’s so special about this?”  Iktinos says, “Are you trying to tell me that you don’t think this dome is impressive?”  A “dome” (dome)  is a round roof of a building.  For example, if you go to Rome in Italy, yo u can see the roof of the Basilica of St. Peter in Vatican City.  There are domes,  for example, in many capitol buildings, such as in our capital of Washington , D.C.; there’s a dome on top of our Capitol Building.  There are domes in man y different kinds  of government and religious buildings throughout the worl d.  Iktinos is saying to Pinda, “don’t you think this dome is impressive,” meanin g it’s something that you would admire, something that you would like.  The expre ssion “are you trying to tell me” is  usually one where we are expressing to the person our d isbelief; we can’t believe that this person doesn’t agree with us or i s saying this thing.

Iktinos says that the dome is one of the largest in the w orld.  Then he says, “Look at those cornices and skylights.”  A “cornice” (cornice) is plast er, a type of building material, or wood that’s put inside of a bui lding usually right next to the ceiling, the top of a room, and it is very fancy – it is very decorated.  A “skylight” is a window in the ceiling that allows light to come into the room.  You can onl y have a skylight, of course, if the ceiling is the roof of t he building, or near the roof of the building.  Iktinos says, “I’ve never seen anything li ke them.”

Pinda says, “This building has a good f acade, with nice balance and symmetry, but I’m so tired of looking at the same style of buildi ng, one after another.”  A “facade” (spelled facade) is the front of the building;  it’s the way that the building appears from the street.  Sometimes the front of the b uilding can look very impressive –  very large, but the rest of the building is not.  We use this word “facade” also to mean the perhaps false impression that p eople give.  They look like they’re happy, but they’re not really happy; their happy face i s a facade.  In architecture, the “facade” is the front of the buildin g.

Pinda says that the building has a good facade with nice balance and symmetry. “Balance” is when you have two things that are in equal amounts or that are in amounts that seem to ma ke sense.  They don’t have one much more than the other, or one that seems to dominate the other.  So balance is – can be equality, equilibrium, but it can also just mean that the propor tions that you see you seem right, they seem correct.  “Symmetry” mean s something is the same on both sides.  It’s similar to “balance,” but it is specifically som ething that is identical, that is the same on two sides.

Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in  any way is prohibited. 8 Pinda says, “I’m so tired of looking at the same style (or  the same type) of building, one after another. ”  She asks, “Aren’t we going to see anything else today?”  Iktinos says, “We are seeing some of the most impor tant monuments to human ingenuity.”  A “monument” is something, normally,  that makes you remember something; it could be a building, it could b e a statue.  It allows you to remember some important person or some important event in history.  “Ingenuity” means creativity, the ability to think of new things and c reate new things.

Pinda says, “You’re right, but I’m too tired to walk up  and down all th ree stories.” A “story” is a floor of the building; it’s a level of the building.  This building has three stories, so it has three levels.  It has the first or ground floor, the second floor, and the third floor.  Pinda and Iktinos are to urists, and Pind a is now tired of walking.  Pinda says, “You go (you go ahead).  I’ll stay h ere on the balcony.”  A “balcony” is a flat area outside of a window or a door that is on an upper floor. You can stand on it and look outside, or simply sit in a ch air and be out side of the building.  If you are familiar with the famous Shakesp eare play Romeo and Juliet , there is a well-known scene –  a well -known part of the play where Juliet is in her house and usually, when you watch the play, it shows her o n a balcony.  She’s on the balcony looking for Romeo; Romeo, of course, is dow n below and starts to talk to Juliet.  It’s such a famous scene that some houses a ctually have what’s called a Juliet balcony.  A Juliet balcony, however, is very small; it’s a small rectangle where one person can barely stand.  It’s not a large extension on the side of the house.

Iktinos asks, “What are you going to do here?”  Pinda says, “I’m going to think about how I’d remodel the building and bring it up to date.”  “To remodel” means to change a  building so that it is better, perhaps more modern or  larger.  “To bring (something) up to date” means to make something m ore modern, more current, more appropriate for the time that we live i n now.  Pinda is saying that she’s going to think about how she  can change this building – remodel it to bring it up to date.  Of course, Iktinos doesn’t like this idea  at all; he says, “You’re hopeless!” meaning there’s nothing I can say or do that w ould change your opinion; you have such a wrong opinion that I’m not  going to bother arguing with you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

# Using Hair Products and Accessories

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 83: Using Hair Products and Accessories.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 483.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there and download a Lea rning Guide for this episode.  The Learning Guide is an 8- to 10-page guid e that will help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Using Hair Products and Accessories.”  It’s about a woman – a girl, who goes to get her hair done by someo ne who is a professional “hair stylist,” someone who cleans and fixes your hair.  No t surprisingly, we’ll be introduced to a lot of vocabulary that is related to get ting your hair done, especially for a woman.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Danny:  You’re going to the prom.  How exciting!  How should we style you hair?

Clarissa:  I’m really not sure.  I was hoping you would have some ideas.

Danny:  I do, but first we need to see if we have the right tools.  Let’s look in your bathroom.  Here’s some shampoo and conditioner, but whe re are the gel, mousse, and hairspray?

Clarissa:  Here, they’re on this shelf.  Here’s a haird ryer and some rollers, too. Do you think we’ll need the curling iron or the flat i ron?

Danny:  I’m not sure, but put them here, just in case.  Okay, now I need a brush and comb, and some bobby pins.  We’ll need some elastic bands, too, to pull your hair back.

Clarissa:  Here, they’re all in this drawer.

Danny:  Oh, this is a pretty barrette, but we won’t nee d it for tonight.  Okay, ready for the transformation?

Clarissa:  I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.

[end of dialogue]

When I was growing up the 1960s and 70s, men who wante d to get their hair cut professionally by someone went to what we called the “ba rber.”  Women who wanted to have their hair cut or “styled,” have their h air in a certain way, would go to a place called the “hair dresser.”  The barber was u sually a man, almost always; the hairdresser was either a woman or a man.  N ow, we have what are called “hair salons,” and these are essentially places where  mostly women but some men also go to get their hair cut and styled.  Ther e are still barbers that only men go to, usually.  I don’t go to either one, of course, it’s no longer necessary!

Danny begins our dialogue by saying to his young friend Cl arissa, “You’re going to the prom.  How exciting!”  The “prom” (prom) is a l arge formal dance in American high schools, usually for those who are in their  last two years of high school: juniors and seniors.  Almost every high school has a  prom; it’s a very big, important dance that a man asks a girl – a boy, really, a sks a girl to go to this formal dance.  Not everyone goes to prom.  If you are s hy and ugly like me, well, you sit at home and you watch television – sad, I know!

Danny says, “You’re going to the prom.  How exciting!  Ho w should we style you hair?”  “To style,” as a verb, means to keep your hair a  particular appearance or a shape.  To color it, to make it shorter, to make it lo nger, that would be to style one’s hair.  Clarissa says, “I’m not really sure.  I was hop ing you would have some ideas.”  So, she’s asking Danny for his ideas.  Danny sa ys, “I do, but first we need to see if we have the right tools.”  He says, “Le t’s look in your bathroom.”  Notice Clarissa did not go to a hair salon;  she asked her friend Danny to come over and help her with her hair.  Danny sa ys, “Here’s some shampoo and conditioner, but where are the gel, mousse,  and hairspray?”

We have several vocabulary words related to taking care of your hair; the first one is “shampoo.”  “Shampoo” is a liquid soap that you u se to clean your hair – to wash your hair.  “Conditioner” is a different liqui d that you put on your hair after it’s clean to make it softer, healthier, easier to style, easier to comb.  A “gel” is a thick liquid that you put in your hair to make it stay in  a certain position.  If you want the front of your hair to go straight up, then yo u would use gel; this thick liquid would allow the hair to stick straight up, kind of like a punk rocker in the 1980s.  “Mousse” (spelled mousse) is also a liquid, but it is one that is very light; it actually has small air bubbles in it.  You put in you r hair to make your hair look

These materials are copyrighted by the Center for Ed ucational Development (2009).   Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited. 7 thicker; you can also use it sort of like a gel, to make it  stay in a certain position. “Hairspray” is a liquid that you spray on dry hair.  normally, mousse, gel, and conditioner are used when the hair is wet.  Hairspray is used when the hair is dry to make sure that the hair doesn’t move.

Clarissa answers Danny, “Here, they’re on this shelf.  Her e’s a hairdryer and some rollers, too.”  A “hairdryer” is a small machine th at blows hot air on the hair to dry it, after you wash it and put whatever other li quids you’re going to put on there.  “Rollers” are small, round pieces of plastic – a small plastic tube that you wrap your hair around.  It’s what women use to make curl s in their hair, where the hair curls around in a little ball.  That is a “r oller.”  Sometimes the roller is actually heated; sometimes it’s just plastic.  These are al so called “curlers” – rollers, that is, are also called “curlers.”  “To curl,” as a verb, means to form a circle with something that is otherwise flat.  You can cur l up a piece of paper; you can take a piece of paper and make it into what looks like  a long tube.

Clarissa also asks Danny, “Do you think we’ll need the curli ng iron or the flat iron?”  A “curling iron” is a small machine that is heat ed.  It has a long piece of metal, like a stick of metal, that gets very hot, and it a llows you to curl the hair, to make them into small circles by putting it into your hair .  The hair goes around the curling iron.  An “iron” is generally a piece of me tal that is hot that is used normally to make something flat, such as if you have a shi rt and you want the shirt to be completely straight, without any wrinkles, you would use a clothes iron. Well, this is a curling iron.  There’s also the little m achine you can use called a “flat iron.”  A “flat iron” is a machine that you hold  in your hand that has two flat pieces of metal that get very hot.  So you put the hair in between the two pieces metal to make the hair straight.  So a curling iron t akes the hair and makes it into a round circle; a flat iron takes the hair and makes it f lat or straight.

Danny says, “I’m not sure, but put them here, just in case ,” just in case they need them.  “Okay,” he says, “now I need a brush and comb, and some bobby pins.” A “brush” is a piece of wood or plastic that you hold in  your hand that has many small pieces – they’re kind of like hairs, they’re usually li ke pieces of plastic but they could also be metal – that you use to make your hair straight or to make your hair go in a certain way.  A “comb” is similar, but it’s flat and it just has one row of these individual, we call them, “teeth” that a  man can use to straighten his hair – or a woman.  Combs and brushes are used to make the hair go in a certain direction.  Both the word “brush” and the word “rolle r” have different meanings in English in addition to the ones we talked about here.  Take a look at our Learning Guide for this episode for some additional explanations.

These materials are copyrighted by the Center for Ed ucational Development (2009).   Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited. 8 “Bobby pins” are small, thin pieces of metal that are f olded in half; they have an opening at one end where you can put the hair to keep  it in a particular place. For example, if you’re a woman or girl and you have so me short hair in the front of your head and you want that hair to not be in your way, you want to put it back on your head, you can use a bobby pin to keep it there.  Bobby pins are not usually easy to see; they’re small and are the same color a s your hair.  They allow you to put your hair up into different positions.   When I was a kid, we used to use them like paper clips to keep pieces of paper toget her.  For some reason, my mother never liked that!

Danny goes onto say, “We’ll need some elastic bands, too, t o pull your hair back.”  An “elastic band” is a small, round piece of pla stic that stretches – it becomes larger.  You can put it around your hair to keep  it in a certain position. For example, if you wanted your hair to stick straight b ack in what we would call a “ponytail,” then you could use one of these elastic band s.

Clarissa says, “Here, they’re all in this drawer,” all of the things that Danny is looking for.  Danny says, “Oh, this is a pretty barrette, but we don’t need it for ton ight.”  A “barrette” is a small piece of plastic, wood,  or metal that opens and closes at one end.  It’s similar to a bobby pin, it allow s you to put your hair in a certain position, but it is bigger and it is easier to se e on the head.  Danny says, “Okay, ready for the transformation (are you ready for th is big, important change)?”  Clarissa says, “I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.”  This is a phrase used to show that you are ready to do something but you’re lit tle worried; you’re a little nervous about it but there isn’t any more preparation t hat you can do, you just want to go ahead and do it: “I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.”  Danny says, “Okay, let the fun begin!”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

# Getting a Performance Evaluation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 484: Getting a Performance Evaluation.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 484.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode; it will help you improve your English even  faster

This episode is called “Getting a Performance Evalu ation,” this is related to your job or work, where your boss sits down with you and  talks to you about how you have been doing – how your work has been, how your performance has been. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Emil:  Have a seat.  As you know, we need to talk a bout your annual performance evaluation.  Is there anything you’d li ke to say before we get started?

Sandra:  Yes, there is.  I’ve tried really hard thi s year to improve on some of the shortcomings identified in my evaluation last year.

Emil:  Hmm, I’m afraid that’s not reflected in this  year’s evaluation.  Your supervisor noted on the report that you’ve been per forming below par for several months now, and your productivity is down, too.

Sandra:  I can’t imagine why she would say that.  I f I haven’t excelled on the new project, I’ve at least pulled my weight.  I don’t t hink she can fault me on that.

Emil:  On the contrary, she thinks that you’ve been  slacking off and not giving 100 percent.

Sandra:  I have had some personal issues, but I did n’t think they had been affecting my work.  I guess I’ve let them bring dow n my performance.

Emil:  This was a hard decision, but we’re putting you on probation for the next three months.  You’ll have another evaluation at the end of that time.  If your performance isn’t up to par by that time, we’ll hav e to think about letting you go.

 Sandra:  That won’t happen.  I’m going to pull out all the stops to prove myself.

Emil:  Good.  That’s what I wanted to hear.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the Emil saying, “Have a s eat,” meaning please sit down.  He’s talking to Sandra, who is one of his em ployees (someone who works for him).  Emil says, “As you know, we need to talk  about your annual performance evaluation.”  The “performance evaluati on” is a written or spoken report about how well you have done on your job, us ually done every six months or one year; “annual” would be every year.

Emil says, “Is there anything you’d like to say bef ore we get started?”  Sandra says, “Yes, there is.  I’ve tried really hard this year to improve on some of the shortcomings identified in my evaluation last year. ”  “Shortcomings” are things that you don’t do very well, things that you should  be able to do better, something that is less than perfect.  Not always are shortcom ings things that you can change, but here I think Sandra is talking about th ings that she can do better, things that are less than perfect.

Emil says, “Hmm, I’m afraid that’s not reflected in  this year’s evaluation.”  “To be reflected,” here, means to, in this case, to be see n; something that is obvious, something that he is able to see and look at, that her changes, in other words, have not really been seen in the evaluation.  The e valuation says she hasn’t changed.  The verb “reflect” has a number of differ ent meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations .  Emil says, “Your supervisor (your immediate boss) noted on the repor t that you’ve been performing below par for several months now, and your productivity is down, too.”  The expression “below par” (par) comes from the sport of golfing; in general usage, it means less than expected, less th an average, not as good as it should be.  There’s a similar expression, “on par,”  which means that it is as good as it should be, it’s right where it ought to be.  But “below par” means that it is less than what it should be.  Emil says that Sandra ’s productivity is down. “Productivity” is, in general, the ability to do a certain amount of work in a certain period of time.  If we say that someone’s productiv ity is down, we mean they are not doing as much work, they are not as productive.

Sandra says, “I can’t imagine why she (her supervis or) would say that.”  She’s surprised, in other words.  Sandra says, “If I have n’t excelled on the new project, I’ve at least pulled my weight.”  “To excel” (excel ) means to do something very

well, better than anyone expected.  She’s saying th at even if she did not excel on the project she’s working on, she at least pulled h er weight.  “To pull your weight” means to do the work that you are expected to do as  part of a group – as part of a team.  Everyone has their job to do in the group;  “to pull your weight” means to do what you are supposed to do.  Sandra is saying t hat well yes, I haven’t done a great job, but I’ve done what I was supposed to do.   She says, “I don’t think she can fault me on that.”  To fault (someone) on (some thing)” means to criticize or say negative things about something that someone ha s done.  To fault someone means to blame someone.  She’s saying here that she  did her work so that her supervisor can’t criticize her for that – can’t fau lt her on that.

Emil says, “On the contrary, she thinks that you’ve  been slacking off and not giving 100 percent.”  So Sandra’s supervisor, who i s not at the meeting (Sandra is meeting with her higher boss, Emil), says that S andra has been slacking off. “To slack (slack) off” is a two-word phrasal verb m eaning to be lazy, not to work very hard, not to do what you are supposed to do.  A phrasal verb is a verb that has more than one word, so “slack off” is a two-wor d verb.  That’s a phrasal verb, in case you were wondering.

In this case, Sandra has been slacking off accordin g to her supervisor, being lazy and not giving 100 percent.  “To give 100 percent” means to work as hard as you can, to do your very best.  Sandra now tries to pro vide an excuse, a reason perhaps why her supervisor might have said what she  did.  She says, “I have had some personal issues,” things that are not related to work such as family or friends.  She’s had some personal issues – some per sonal problems, but she didn’t think they had been affecting her work.  She  says, “I guess I’ve let them bring down my performance.”  “To bring down” is a t wo-word phrasal verb meaning to reduce, to decrease, to make something l ess or perhaps smaller. “To bring down your productivity” means to lower it , to make it less than it was before.  “To bring down” can also mean to depress a nother person, to make another person feel sad.  There was a song in the l ate 70s, Don’t Bring Me Down – don’t depress me.

Emil says, “This was a hard decision, but we’re put ting you on probation for the next three months.”  “Probation” is a period when y ou are being tested to decide whether or not they are going to keep you or let yo u go – fire you, in this case.  A probationary period is a trial period; it’s when yo u are testing someone.  In this case, she is going to be on probation for three mon ths.  Then, Emil says, “You’ll have another evaluation at the end of that time (at  the end of three months).  If your performance isn’t up to par by that time, we’l l have to think about letting you go.”  “Up to par” is another one of those expressio ns coming from golf, meaning to be at the level we expect.  It’s the same as “on  par.”  So she must improve her

performance, if not, they may have to let her go.  “To let (someone) go” is a nice way of saying to fire someone.  Another way to say that would be “to lay (someone) off,” causing someone to lose their job.

Sandra says, “That won’t happen,” meaning she will improve her performance; it will not be below par.  “I’m going to pull out all the stops to prove myself.”  “To pull out all the stops (or ‘all of the stops’)” mea ns to do something as hard as possible, as much as possible, as quickly as possib le, to put all your effort into something.  The term, I believe, originally comes f rom the playing of the organ, which is a instrument that is very loud, often foun d in churches.  “To pull out all the stops” means to make the organ as loud as possi ble.  Here it means that Sandra is going to work as hard she can to prove he rself.  “To prove yourself” means to show that you can do something well, to sh ow that you are worth something, that you should be considered for someth ing.  Sandra needs to prove herself, she needs to demonstrate – to show her bos s that they should keep her and not let her go.

Emil says, “Good.  That’s what I wanted to hear,” I  want to hear that you’re going to try to improve.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Emil:  Have a seat.  As you know, we need to talk a bout your annual performance evaluation.  Is there anything you’d li ke to say before we get started?

Sandra:  Yes, there is.  I’ve tried really hard thi s year to improve on some of the shortcomings identified in my evaluation last year.

Emil:  Hmm, I’m afraid that’s not reflected in this  year’s evaluation.  Your supervisor noted on the report that you’ve been per forming below par for several months now, and your productivity is down, too.

Sandra:  I can’t imagine why she would say that.  I f I haven’t excelled on the new project, I’ve at least pulled my weight.  I don’t t hink she can fault me on that.

Emil:  On the contrary, she thinks that you’ve been  slacking off and not giving 100 percent.

Sandra:  I have had some personal issues, but I did n’t think they had been affecting my work.  I guess I’ve let them bring dow n my performance.

Emil:  This was a hard decision, but we’re putting you on probation for the next three months.  You’ll have another evaluation at the end of that time.  If your performance isn’t up to par by that time, we’ll hav e to think about letting you go.

Sandra:  That won’t happen.  I’m going to pull out all the stops to prove myself.

Emil:  Good.  That’s what I wanted to hear.

# Being Clumsy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 485: Being Clumsy.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 485.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there and download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page PDF file we provide for all of our current episodes that will help you improve your English even faster.  This episode is called “Being Clumsy.”  “To be clumsy” means to be unable to control your body very well; you are always falling down or having accidents.  That’s being clumsy.  It’s a dialogue between Edward and Bella about being clumsy, about being someone who isn’t able to dance very well.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Edward:  Would you dance with me?    Bella:  Me?  I’d like to, but I don’t dance.  Edward:  Why?  Bella:  I have two left feet.  I’m so clumsy, first I’d step all over your feet, and then I’d stumble all over the dance floor.  Edward:  I don’t believe that.  I bet you’re very graceful on the dance floor.  You wouldn’t stumble; you’d glide across that floor.  Bella:  I’m the most uncoordinated person alive.  When I was little, I was even more awkward.  My mother hated taking me shopping because I was so accident-prone.  Everywhere we’d go, I was like a bull in a china shop.  I’m not like Rosalie.  Look at her.  She’s so elegant.    Edward:  Rosalie has nothing on you.  Dance with me and I promise to catch you if you trip.  Bella:  What if I step all over your feet? # Having Limited Mobility

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 86 – Having Limited Mobility.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 486.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can go there to download  a Learning Guide for this episode, which contains all of the vocabulary, definit ions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension qu estions, and, best of all, a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Having Limited Mobility.”  “Mobil ity” is the ability to move around.  It will be a dialogue between Gail and Mike  using some vocabulary that would be related to people who are not able to move around with their body as easily as others.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gail:  Oh!

Mike:  Are you okay?

Gail:  Yeah, I’m just not used to these crutches yet.  The doctor said I should start using them if I ever want to get out of this whe elchair, but I don’t have the strength to stand up.

Mike:  You’ll get the hang of it.  Don’t lose heart.

Gail:  It should be easy now that my arm is out of the cast, but it just seems impossible.  I feel I’m going to lose my balance each ti me I try to stand up.

Mike:  Try again, and this time lean on me and I’ll tr y to serve as your legs until you can find your balance.

Gail:  I wish I didn’t feel so utterly useless.  It’s so f rustrating!

Mike:  I know.  Just keep your eye on the ball and give it another try.  The next thing you know, you’ll be limping along and then runni ng a marathon.  It’s just a matter of time before you get your mobility back.

 Gail:  Yeah, right.  Okay, first things first.  Let’s see if these useless legs of mine will cooperate this time.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Gail saying, “Oh!”  She, we t hink, has hurt herself or is in pain.  Mike says, “Are you okay?”  Gail says, “Yeah, I’m  just not used to these crutches yet.”  She’s not used to – she’s not accustomed to th ese crutches.  A “crutch” is a long stick that you put underneath your arms,  in what we call the “armpit,” that’s the part that is underneath your shoul der.  You use the crutches to move more easily when your legs are injured for some reason.  So if you break your leg, you’ll probably be given two crutches to help  you walk more easily.

Gail says, “The doctor said I should start using them (the crutches) if I ever want to get out of this wheelchair.”  A “wheelchair” is a spe cial chair that has wheels – not too surprisingly!  It’s used by people who can’t walk easily or cannot walk at all because there is a problem with their legs.  Gail sa ys, “I don’t have the strength to stand up.”  She’s saying I’m not strong enou gh to stand up. “Strength” means the energy and ability to use your muscl es in a certain way; in this case, the muscles in her legs.

Mike says, “You’ll get the hang of it.”  “To get the ha ng of (something)” means to learn to do something so that it becomes normal, easy for you, to be able to do something without having to think about it or put a lo t of effort into it.  If you drive a new car or you get a new piece of computer software, it may take you a while to get the hang of it – to get used to it, to do it well.  Mike says, “Don’t lose heart.” This expression, “to lose heart,” means to give up, to thi nk that you will never be able to do something.  Mike says, “Do not lose heart,” m eaning don’t give up.

Gail says, “It should be easy now that my arm is out of the  cast, but it just seems impossible.”  A “cast” (cast) here means a piece of plaster , which is a heavy, hard, white material that is put around a part of you r body so that it won’t move. If you break your arm or your leg, they will usually put this big white cast on your leg or your arm so that you don’t move it.  This allows t he body to get better – to heal.  “Cast” has a number of different meanings in En glish; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Gail says, “I feel I’m going to lose my balance each time  I stand up.”  “To lose your balance” means to fall over or to start to fall over , perhaps because you are “dizzy,” meaning you feel somehow that your head is moving  around and your body begins to become unsteady.  Little boys, for example,  sometimes like to

 turn around and around and around, if they do that too much, they get dizzy and they may lose their balance – they may fall down.

Gail says that she feels like she’s going to lose her bala nce each time she tries to stand up.  Mike says, “Try again, and this time lean on me .”  “To lean (lean) on (someone)” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to support  yourself against another person or thing, especially when you are stand ing.  So for example if you hurt your leg, you may stand up and then lean on anoth er person, put your arm or put your body against that person so that that person  can help you stay standing so you won’t fall down.  That’s the most common  definition; there’s another meaning of this phrase, “to lean on (someone) .”  It can also mean to apply pressure, force, or perhaps even a threat to someon e in order to get them to do something.  It’s an expression you would probably he ar if you are talking about a crime gang that is trying to pressure someone i nto doing something, perhaps even something illegal.

Mike says, “I’ll try to serve as your legs until you can find  your balance.”  “To serve as (something)” means to act as something, especially wh en the other thing is not available, to take the place of something e lse.  For example, I have a big table that serves as my desk.  It’s not a desk, it wasn’t  designed to be a desk, it was made to be a table that you would sit and eat a t, but I use it as my desk.  It serves as – it takes the place of – it serves the function of my desk.  The verb “serve” has many different meanings in English however; p lease take a look at today’s Learning Guide for some additional explanation s.

Mike is telling Gail that he will help her stand up an d help her walk.  Gail says, “I wish I didn’t feel so utterly useless.”  The word “utter ly” (utterly) means completely, entirely, 100 percent.  It’s often used to d escribe some sort of negative emotion.  “I’m utterly exhausted today” means I ’m completely tired; I’m very, very tired.  In this case, Gail says she feels “utterly u seless,” meaning 100 percent useless, completely useless.  She says, “It’s so frustra ting (it’s so discouraging)!”

Mike says, “I know.  Just keep your eye on the ball and give it another try.”  “To keep your eye on the ball” is an expression we use to mean  to focus on your goal or objective; don’t get distracted by other things; don’ t let other things bother you. If you are trying to win an Olympic gold medal, you need  to keep your eye on the ball – you need to continue to focus and concentrate o n something.  You might hear the expression “he took his eye off the ball,” meani ng he lost his focus, he didn’t pay attention to what he should of been paying attention.

 Mike says, “The next thing you know, you’ll be limping alon g and then running a marathon.”  The expression “the next thing you know” is use d to say that something will happen very quickly, much more quickly than y ou thought, much sooner than you thought.  So, sooner than you think, whi ch is another way of saying this, “you’ll be limping.”  “To limp” means to w alk in a way that puts very little weight on one foot or leg, usually because you’r e injured.  So if you hurt your right leg, you will be limping, you will not be usin g your right leg very much, and so you will walk a little funny.  Usually if you’re limpi ng, you’re moving a little more slowly as well.  A “marathon” is a long race for ru nners, approximately 26 miles.  It’s a very common kind of long distance run, a “m arathon.”  It comes originally from Greek history – ancient Greek history, but we won’t talk about that now.

Mike says, “It’s just a matter of time before you get your mobility back,” before you get your ability to move around in your body easily.  G ail says, “Yeah, right,” meaning she’s not really sure that’s true.  “Yeah, righ t” is often used as an expression when someone doesn’t think it’s true.  Even thou gh they are saying something that sounds like they’re agreeing, in many cases – in most cases it means that they don’t agree with that.  Gail says, “first  things first.”  We use this phrase to talk about the need to do things in order, o ne thing at a time.  You have to do the most important thing first, the thing that comes first in order.  She says, “Let’s see if these useless legs of mine will cooperate thi s time.”  She’s saying yes, maybe someday I will be able to run a marathon, bu t first I need be able to walk, so she needs to get her legs to work properly for he r.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gail:  Oh!

Mike:  Are you okay?

Gail:  Yeah, I’m just not used to these crutches yet.  The doctor said I should start using them if I ever want to get out of this whe elchair, but I don’t have the strength to stand up.

Mike:  You’ll get the hang of it.  Don’t lose heart.

Gail:  It should be easy now that my arm is out of the cast, but it just seems impossible.  I feel I’m going to lose my balance each ti me I try to stand up.

 Mike:  Try again, and this time lean on me and I’ll tr y to serve as your legs until you can find your balance.

Mike:  I know.  Just keep your eye on the ball and give it another try.  The next thing you know, you’ll be limping along and then runni ng a marathon.  It’s just a matter of time before you get your mobility back.

Gail:  Yeah, right.  Okay, first things first.  Let’s see if these useless legs of mine will cooperate this time.

# Watching Videos on the Internet

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 87: Watching Videos on the Internet.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 487.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can download a Learning Guide, which will help you improve your English even faster by going to our websi te.

This episode is called “Watching Videos on the Internet.”   It’s a dialogue between Sheila and Rudy talking about watching videos on your com puter versus on your television.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sheila:  Where are you going?

Rudy:  I’m going to the video store to rent a movie for tonight.  Do you want to come?

Sheila:  You don’t need to do that.  We can watch nea rly any movie you want online.

Rudy:  Oh, you mean we can pay to download it?

Sheila:  Yeah, we can download it, but we don’t have to pay for it.

Rudy:  What do you mean?  You’re not using a file-shari ng site, are you?

Sheila:  Of course, I am.  Everybody is doing it.

Rudy:  Aside from the ethical issues, it’s so frustrating wa tching videos online. The ones that stream are constantly pausing to buffer.  The interruptions drive me crazy!

Sheila:  Yeah, sometimes, but there’s usually a workaroun d.

 Rudy:  Even so, the movies are usually pirated and they’re so grainy.  I want to watch something in high definition.  Come on, let’s go  to the video store.  It’ll be my treat.

Sheila:  All right, if you insist, but why can’t we just pay to download it right here at home?

Rudy:  We could do that, but where would we get the p opcorn?

[end of dialogue]

Sheila asks Rudy, “Where are you going?”  Rudy says, “I’m go ing to the video store to rent a movie for tonight.”  A “video store” i s a store where you can rent or buy a movie; you can rent it for usually two or three days,  sometimes longer. Video stores became very popular in the 1980s, after vide ocassette players became popular.  Now they have DVDs instead of the old ca ssettes.  But, because of the new Internet services and other mail service s, video stores are not as popular now as they were, say, 10 or 15 years ago .

Rudy asks Sheila if she wants to come with him.  He says, “D o you want to come?” meaning do you want to come with me.  In some pa rts of the country, you would say, “Do you want to come with?”  The idea is “come with me.”  Sheila says, “You don’t need to do that,” meaning you don’t ne ed to go to the video store.  “We can watch nearly any movie you want (almost an y movie you want) online.”  “Online” means on the Internet, on the Wo rld Wide Web.

Rudy says, “Oh, you mean we can pay to download it?”  “To  download” means to save a file from the Internet or a website onto your com puter.  If you are listening to this on your MP3 player, such as your iPod, you downloa ded the file from the Internet to put it on your player.  Rudy says, “you mean  we can pay to download it?” meaning we pay money and then we download the mo vie.  Sheila says, “Yeah, we can download it, but we don’t have to pay for it.”  This is, of course, common on the Internet nowadays, people downloading th ings that they did not pay for.

Rudy says, “What do you mean?  You’re not using a file-sha ring site, are you?” “File sharing” is when you exchange files, often files tha t you have copied illegally, with someone else.  This is, of course, against  the law but it is common, at least it is common among some people on the Internet .  I don’t to it myself.

Sheila says, “Of course, I am (of course I’m using a file sh aring site).  Everyone is doing it.”  This is a common excuse for people who do things that are wrong;

 they’ll say, “Well, everyone is doing it,” meaning it must  be okay if everyone is doing it.

Rudy says, “Aside from the ethical issues, it’s so frustrating  watching videos online.”  “Aside from” means in addition to, or beside s.  So, in addition to the ethical issues, Rudy is saying, there are other problems: it’s frustrating to watch the videos online.  “Ethical” means something that is ri ght or wrong; “ethical” refers to whether something is correct or incorrect moral ly, from a position of right and wrong.  Rudy is saying that there are ethical proble ms, meaning it’s wrong to steal someone else’s files without paying them.  But it’s also frustrating; it’s not very satisfying, not very pleasing to watch videos online.  He  says, “The ones that stream are constantly pausing to buffer.”  To “strea m” on the Internet means that you’re not saving the file onto your computer, you ’re just watching or listening to the file from the website but you’re not downloading it, necessarily.  In fact, you’re usually not downloading it if it’s streaming .  When it streams, sometimes because of the slow Internet connections, it has t o stop so that it has enough of the file to continue going.  This is called “to buffer,” when a computer holds data or information for a brief time before usi ng it.  “To pause” means to stop doing something.  So, the video stops – it pauses to  buffer, to get enough data (enough information) to continue.  “Stream,” I should say also, is a word that has a couple of different meanings in English, so of cour se, take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Rudy says, “The interruptions drive me crazy!”  An “interru ption” is something that stops you from doing what you are doing right now  in order to do something else, usually for a short period of time.  If a parent is talking to a friend of theirs, and their four-year-old child keeps saying, “Mommy, I have a question,” and the parent has to stop and answer the child, the child is in terrupting the parent.  The verb is “to interrupt,” the noun is “an interruption.”   Normally, it’s something that you want to avoid, that you don’t want to happen.  In this case, the video keeps stopping, and that is an interruption for Rudy.

Sheila says, “Yeah, sometimes (sometimes there are interr uptions that drive you crazy, that make you angry or upset), but there’s usually a w orkaround.”  A “workaround” is a solution that doesn’t fix a problem, b ut let’s you do something in a different way to get around the problem, to get  what you want to have done. Even though you haven’t solved the problem you’re able to do it.  So for example, your email software stops working.  Well, you can also send email online with your email account, let’s just say, so a workar ound would be to use the Internet browser to send email until you can get you r email software program fixed.  You didn’t solve the problem of your program,  but you found a workaround – you found another way to get the same things done.

 Rudy says, “Even so (even though there are workarounds for t hese interruption problems), the movies are usually pirated and they’re so  grainy.”  “To pirate,” as a verb, means to, in this case, to copy without permission , especially when we’re talking about music or movies, or podcasts.  That’s “pirati ng” something.  Rudy says, “the movies are usually pirated (meaning they have bee n pirated – stolen) and they’re so grainy.”  Something that is “grainy” is an  image that is not clear or seems a little rough because it has some small spots on it.  If you take a photograph and you try to enlarge, or make bigger one part of the photograph, sometimes that will cause the photograph to become grain y, you can’t see things clearly.

Rudy says, “I want to watch something in high definition .”  “High definition” is a certain technology now that you can use with your televisi on; you can buy a television that is HD, or high definition.  It’s supposed  to be a much clearer picture, something that is much higher quality.  I don’t  have a high definition television, so I can’t tell you.  My television is black and white, from the 1960s; so, I guess there are color televisions now, people tell me!

Rudy says that he wants to watch something in high defini tion, he says, “Come on, let’s go to the video store.  It’ll be my treat.”  A “treat,” in this case, means that you are going to pay for something as a gift for someon e else.  You can use it as a verb: “I will treat you to dinner.”  That means I a m going to invite you to dinner and I will pay for your dinner.  So, Rudy says, “It’ll b e my treat (I will pay for the movie).”  “Treat” has a couple of different meanings in  English, so take a look at our Learning Guide for some more definitions.

Sheila says, “All right (okay), if you insist.”  This is a ph rase used to show that you will agree to do something, what another person i s suggesting, especially if that person has made a generous offer and it’s somethin g that you want to do anyway.  So, for example I don’t want to go shopping, a nd my wife says, “Well, I’ll buy you a new pair of shoes if you go with me shoppi ng,” so I say, “Okay, if you insist,” meaning I want the pair of shoes, you are aski ng me, you are giving me this gift, therefore I will go.  Then she uses my cr edit card, so it doesn’t really matter!

Sheila says, “All right, if you insist, but why can’t we ju st pay to download it right here at home?”  She’s saying well, we can pay to downloa d a high quality movie here and not go to the video store.  Rudy says, “We coul d do that, but where would we get the popcorn?”  “Popcorn” is a food that is commonly eaten at movies, at least in the United States.  It is made from  heating dry corn in oil or hot air, and then putting butter and salt on top of the popcorn.  Many video stores

 sell popcorn in addition to renting videos.  It’s very expe nsive there, however; it’s much cheaper just to buy it at the regular grocery stor e – if you like popcorn!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Sheila:  Where are you going?

Rudy:  I’m going to the video store to rent a movie for tonight.  Do you want to come?

Sheila:  You don’t need to do that.  We can watch nea rly any movie you want online.

Rudy:  Oh, you mean we can pay to download it?

Sheila:  Yeah, we can download it, but we don’t have to pay for it.

Rudy:  What do you mean?  You’re not using a file-shari ng site, are you?

Sheila:  Of course, I am.  Everybody is doing it.

Rudy:  Aside from the ethical issues, it’s so frustrating wa tching videos online. The ones that stream are constantly pausing to buffer.  The interruptions drive me crazy!

# Getting Around Regulations

This episode is called “Getting Around Regulations.”  It ’s a dialogue between Michael and Leona that talks about laws, rules, regulati ons that all of us have to follow at some point in our life.  Let’s get started

[start of dialogue]

Michael:  I have some qualms about how we’re handling t hese accounts.

Leona:  What do you mean?

Michael:  There are strict regulations governing what we can and cannot do, and I think we’re violating those regulations.

Leona:  Listen, it’s a matter of interpretation.  We’ re not flouting any regulations. We’re just not following the letter of the law.

Michael:  I, for one, think that we’ve crossed the line.   I’m not against some creative accounting, but what we’re doing is bordering o n criminal.

Leona:  Aren’t you blowing things out of proportion?   The government makes laws knowing that people are going to try to get aroun d them.  There are always loopholes and that’s why they turn a blind eye to most of these types of activities. As long as we comply with most of the regulations, we’re not going to get into any hot water.

Michael:  I appreciate your confidence, but I don’t share  it.  I think we’re in for some major problems if we don’t change the way we do b usiness.

 Leona:  Come on, let’s go get some coffee and see what we can do about that overactive conscience of yours.

Our dialogue begins with Michael saying, “I have some qua lms about how we’re handling these accounts.”  “Qualm” (qualm) is when you d on’t feel right about something; you think that something is wrong, something,  perhaps, is even dangerous.  Usually it has to do with things that you are  doing that are against the law or perhaps against some rule or regulation.  M ichael has some qualms about how he and Leona are handling, or dealing wit h, certain accounts, perhaps certain customers that they have, or certain financial ar rangements.

Leona says, “What do you mean?”  Michael says, “There are strict regulations governing what we can and cannot do, and I think we’re  violating those regulations.”  “Regulation” is just another word for a rule or a law, something you can do or not do.  Governments have regulations; compani es sometimes have regulations about what you can wear to work or not wea r to work, what you can do and not do at your job.  Michael says, “There are stri ct (meaning there are very specific and serious) regulations governing what we can  do and not do.” “To govern” is to control, to have authority or power ove r something, to lead something.  The president governs the country; the govern or governs the state (the leader of a state is called a governor).  “To gover n” is the verb; it means to be in authority, in this case to rule over or to control  a certain thing.  In this case it’s regulations that are governing what you can do and  not do – are telling you what you can do and not do.  Michael says, “I think we’re violating those regulations.”  Here, “to violate” means to break a rul e, to break the law, to go against something, to do something that is not allowed .

Leona says, “Listen, it’s a matter of interpretation,” m eaning it depends on how you understand something, how it’s explained to you; some  people could see it one way; other people could see it another.  “Interpre tation” has a couple of different meanings however, so take a look at our Learni ng Guide for some additional explanations.  Leona says, “We’re not floutin g any regulations.”  “To flout” (flout) means to break a law or to go against a  rule without hiding your actions, without even trying to hide what you are doing,  you’re just doing it very openly.  Usually it’s to show that you don’t respect this l aw or this regulation, you don’t agree with it.  Leona says, “We’re not to flouti ng any regulations.  We’re just not following the letter of the law.”  “To follow t he letter of the law” means to obey a law exactly, to do exactly what a law says.  The opposite would be to follow the spirit of the law.  “To follow the spirit of the law”  means to do what you think the

 law is trying to accomplish, what you think the law means.  To follow the letter of the law means to do exactly what the law says, word by wo rd.

Michael says, “I, for one, think that we’ve crossed the lin e.”  “I, for one” means I, among everyone here, and perhaps there are more peopl e like me who agree with me.  He’s sort of setting himself apart, he’s saying  well, that’s your opinion, but my opinion is different.  “I, for one, think that we’ve crossed the line.”  “To cross the line” means to do something that is breaking a r egulation, that is going against a law, that is going too far, too extreme.  So metimes we use this expression when someone does something that they think is su pposed to be funny but it isn’t really funny, it may be mean or cruel.   They’ve crossed the line; they’ve crossed the line separating humor from cruelty for example, someone who has gone too far.

Michael says, “I’m not against some creative accounting, but  what we’re doing is bordering on criminal.”  The expression “creative account ing” was originally, and still is sort of a comical expression, something that’s supp osed to be funny. “Creative accounting” means to report financial informa tion, in this case in a way that will make the company seen profitable.  In other w ords, you do some tricks with the numbers; you report them in such a way that thi ngs look better for your company than they really are.  That’s creative accounting.  “Accounting” is the organization of your company’s money, it’s keeping track of – it’s keeping your records of how much money you’re making, how much money you’ re spending, and so forth.  Creative accounting, then, is doing thin gs with that account to make yourself better than you really are.

Michael says, “what we’re doing is bordering on criminal. ”  “To border on (something)” is to be almost doing something, to be very close to being or doing something.  “My singing is so bad it borders on painful,”  meaning to hear me sing is to experience pain it’s so bad – it borders on painfu l.  Not painful, but borders on painful – almost painful.  That’s what most people  tell me!  The word “border” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learn ing Guide for some additional explanations of that word.

Leona says, “Aren’t you blowing things out of proportio n?”  “To blow things out of portion” means to treat something as if it were more i mportant or more significant than it really is, to consider something very important wh en it isn’t very important. Your friend says that she’s going to call you at 10:00 in the morning, and instead she calls you at 10:15, 15 minutes later.  You talk to he r and you get all angry, you yell at her, you’re very upset.  She might say, “You’re  blowing things out of proportion,” you’re making this small thing much more i mportant, much bigger than it really is.

 Leona says, “The government makes laws knowing that people  are going to try to get around them.”  Leona has some interesting ide as about ethics and morals, here.  She says the government makes laws knowing that pe ople are going to try to break them, that people are going to try to find w ays not to obey them, not to do what they say.  “To get around (something),” here, m eans to find a way to not have to do something.  She says, “There are always loopho les.”  A “loophole” is something that is written into a law or regulation th at lets some people not have to do what other people have to do, it’s like an excepti on.

She says that there are always loopholes, and that’s why w e turn a blind eye to most of these types of activities.  “To be blind” means you  can’t see.  The expression “to turn a blind eye” means to pretend not to  see or notice something, especially when someone is doing something wrong.  You j ust look the other way, you pretend like it’s not happening.  She says, “As lo ng as we comply with most of the regulations, we’re not going to get into any hot water.”  “To comply” means to follow a rule or a law.  She says, “As long as we comply with most of the regulations, we’re not going to get into any hot  water.”  “To get into hot water” means to get into a situation where you are in trouble  because, perhaps, you broke the law or broke a particular rule or regulation .  Sometimes you can get in hot water, for example, with your wife because you said you would call her at 10:00 and you didn’t.  That would get you into hot wa ter – at least it would get me into hot water!

Michael says, “I appreciate your confidence, but I don’t s hare it (I don’t agree with you).  I think we’re in for some major problems if we don’t change the way we do business.”  To say you’re “in for” means that you are going to have, you are going to experience in the future.

Leona says, “Come on, let’s go get some coffee and see wh at we can do about that overactive conscience of yours.”  Your “conscience” is the  part of your thinking that tells you whether something is right or w rong.  “To be overactive” means to be too active, to be too sensitive perhaps.  So a n “overactive conscience” would be someone who thinks everything they’re doing is wrong. One has to wonder who has the overactive conscience and w ho has the under- active conscience in this dialogue!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, at a normal sp eed.

[start of dialogue]

Michael:  I have some qualms about how we’re handling t hese accounts.

 Leona:  What do you mean?

Michael:  There are strict regulations governing what we can and cannot do, and I think we’re violating those regulations.

Leona:  Listen, it’s a matter of interpretation.  We’ re not flouting any regulations. We’re just not following the letter of the law.

Michael:  I, for one, think that we’ve crossed the line.   I’m not against some creative accounting, but what we’re doing is bordering o n criminal.

Leona:  Aren’t you blowing things out of proportion?   The government makes laws knowing that people are going to try to get aroun d them.  There are always loopholes and that’s why they turn a blind eye to most of these types of activities. As long as we comply with most of the regulations, we’re not going to get into any hot water.

Michael:  I appreciate your confidence, but I don’t share  it.  I think we’re in for some major problems if we don’t change the way we do b usiness.

Leona:  Come on, let’s go get some coffee and see what we can do about that overactive conscience of yours.

# Talking About Wealth

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 89: Talking About Wealth.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 489.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide of this episode that contains, among other things, a complete t ranscript of everything we say.

This episode is called “Talking About Wealth.”  “Wealth”  is having a lot of money. It’s a dialogue between Anton and Vanessa, where we’re  going to hear a lot of vocabulary that is used when talking about people who hav e a lot of money. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Anton:  Look at that guy.  He’s been in town two weeks a nd he’s already throwing his money around.

Vanessa:  You know as well as I do that money talks.  He’s j ust trying to make a splash in the business community.

Anton:  If that were all he was doing then I wouldn’ t say anything, but he’s a social climber of the worst kind.  Who does he think he i s?

Vanessa:  He’s someone who’s used to getting his way, that’ s obvious.  He’s not the first affluent person to try to buy influence and so cial standing in a community.

Anton:  Yeah, but look at all of the people in this t own throwing themselves at him!

Vanessa:  He has donated generously to the town and given  to the arts.  He’s even given money toward building the new community center , and it wasn’t chump change either.  If he wants to be a patron in th is town, who are we to look a gift horse in the mouth?

 Anton:  Right, so spreading money around gives him the right to walk around like he owns this town?

Vanessa:  Is this a case of sour grapes?

Anton:  Ha, right!  Haven’t you heard?  Money is the r oot of all evil!

[end of dialogue]

Anton begins the conversation by saying, “Look at that guy.  He’s been in town two weeks and he’s already throwing his money around.”  H e’s been in town – he’s been in this city for only two weeks and he’s already t hrowing his money around.  “To throw your money around” means to spend a  lot of money so that everyone knows that you have a lot of money; you’re letti ng everyone know that you are rich.

Vanessa says, “You know as well as I do that money talks.”  T his expression, “money talks,” means that people who have a lot of money get attention; they’re able to influence things, they have power.  Vanessa says, “H e’s just trying to make a splash in the business community.”  “To make a splash ” means to do something that other people will notice, to do somethi ng that other people will see.  “Splash” has a couple of meanings in English; take a  look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Anton says, “If that were all he was doing then I would n’t say anything, but he’s a social climber of the worst kind.  Who does he think he i s?”  To be a “social climber” means to be a person who tries to get power o r influence in society or an organization by getting or being in relationships,  friendships with people.  A social climber is someone who wants to be important, and so decides on making friends so that he or she can have more power.  It’s usual ly considered a negative description to call someone a social climber.  An ton thinks that this guy is a social climber; “Who does he think he is?” he says.  Thi s is a question that we might use to say this person thinks that they are more important than they really are.

Vanessa says, “He’s someone who’s used to getting his way, t hat’s obvious.” “To get your way” means to have things happen the way tha t you want them to happen, to be able to control things.  “He always gets his way,” people always do what he wants them to do.  Vanessa says, “He’s not the fi rst affluent person to try to buy influence and social standing in a community.”  He’ s the – rather, he’s not the first affluent person; “affluent” is another word for rich, wealthy, someone with a lot of money.  Not me, for example!  “He’s not the f irst affluent person to try to

 buy influence.”  “To buy influence” is to use your money so  that you are more powerful, you are more important.  He’s trying to buy i nfluence and social standing.  “Social standing” is your importance in a comm unity, in an organization, in society.  We might also say your “social st atus,” the way people look at you and treat you in a group or community.

Anton says, “Yeah, but look at all of the people in thi s town throwing themselves at him!”  “To throw yourself at (someone)” means to do  something, to do whatever is necessary to get someone’s attention or to be l iked by another person.  A woman, for example, who’s very interested in a  handsome man – a good looking man – might throw herself at him, might try to do anything to get him to pay attention to her or to like her.  This has n ever happened to me!

Vanessa says, “He has donated generously to the town and gi ven to the arts.” “To donate” means to give money to usually an organizat ion that needs it.  The Red Cross, for example, receives donations.  This person ha s “donated generously,” meaning he’s given a lot of money to the to wn – to the community and to the arts.  “The arts” refers to theater, or mu sic groups, or artistic groups; all of these would be considered part of the arts: ope ra, dance, and so forth. Vanessa says, “He’s even given money toward building the new  community center, and it wasn’t chump change either.”  A “communit y center” would be a building that people in your neighborhood or communi ty or a small town would use for various purposes: meetings for example, performan ces perhaps.  This is a case where someone has given money toward building a ne w community center, and Vanessa says it wasn’t “chump change.”  This is an  informal expression meaning a small amount of money, an amount of money that is so small it’s not important.  That’s chump change, “chump” ( chump).

This man has not given chump change, meaning it wasn’t a small amount; it was a lot of money.  Vanessa says, “If he wants to be a patron  in this town, who are we to look a gift horse in the mouth?”  A “patron” is a person who supports, usually with their money, an organization.  Usually it’ s a non-profit organization or an artistic organization.  That’s a patron.  The expressio n “to look a gift horse in the mouth” means to not be thankful for a gift, and i nstead wonder why that person is giving you this gift.  It can also mean that you shouldn’t try to look too closely at the gift with an attempt to find if you can g et more out of it, try to get something more from the person who gave it to you.  Th ose are both possible meanings of this expression.  Here, I think it just means t hat we should not be ungrateful; we should be thankful for this gift and no t look at it too closely, we should be just happy that we have it.

 Anton says, “Right, so spreading money around gives him the  right to walk around like he owns this town?”  “To spread money around ” means to spend a lot of money in many different places or with many differen t people and organizations.  Anton says that because he is spending so mu ch money he thinks he can walk around this town – this community as if h e owns it, that is to say like he were the owner of the town.

Vanessa says, “Is this a case of sour grapes?”  “Sour grapes”  is the feeling of wanting something that you don’t have, perhaps because yo u lost a competition or because you don’t have as much money or talent as ano ther person. Sometimes people pretend that whatever the other perso n has is not important or is bad.  It’s really a kind of jealousy, to want what some one else has and to be angry or mad that the other person has it.

Anton says, “Ha, right!”  Oddly enough, this expression re ally means you’re wrong, I don’t agree with you.  Sometimes when peopl e say “right,” they really are trying to say I don’t agree with you, it depends on how they say it.  In this case, Anton is trying to use expression to show disagreement.   “Ha, right! Haven’t you heard?  Money is the root of all evil!”  The  “root” of something is the cause got something, in this case.  “Money is the root of  all evil” is an expression that means that money causes problems.  The expression origi nally comes from the Bible, and it is not “Money is the root of all evil ,” it’s “Love of money is the root of all evil.”  It’s not the money that’s bad, it’s loving  your money too much that can be bad.  But now the expression has changed, really, int o this notion that money itself is the root of evil.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Anton:  Look at that guy.  He’s been in town two weeks a nd he’s already throwing his money around.

Vanessa:  You know as well as I do that money talks.  He’s j ust trying to make a splash in the business community.

Anton:  If that were all he was doing then I wouldn’ t say anything, but he’s a social climber of the worst kind.  Who does he think he i s?

# Eating Spoiled Food

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 90: Eating Spoiled Food.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 490.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of our vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes…what else?  Oh, and a complete transcript of this episode.

This episode is called “Eating Spoiled Food.”  “Spoiled  food” is food that is no longer good to eat.  We’ll listen to a dialogue betw een Ryan and Corrie using a lot of vocabulary that you might see or hear describing spo iled food.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ryan:  It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me.  It ’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked meal.

Corrie:  I’m happy to do it.  First, though, let’s see  what you have in your fridge.

Ryan:  I have tons of food in there.

Corrie:  What is that?  It looks moldy.

Ryan:  Oh, that’s cheese.  I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts.

Corrie:  Okay, but look at the “best if used by” date.  This expired three months ago.  What about this?

Ryan:  That’s hamburger.  Maybe you could make some spaghet ti with meatballs.

Corrie:  Not with this rotten meat.  It’s definitely g one bad.  Can’t you tell by the discoloration?  Meat isn’t supposed to be gray.

Ryan:  I guess you’re right.  I bet this milk isn’t any go od either, is it?

 Corrie:  Nope.  It’s gone sour, and you might as well t hrow out this bread, too. It’s stale.

Ryan:  Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?

Corrie:  Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks tai nted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted.  You do have a lo t of food in your kitchen, but it’s been here a long, long time.

Ryan:  I don’t like things to go to waste.

Corrie:  I guess not.  I’m still willing to make you d inner, but we’ll have to do some shopping.  My cooking isn’t the best, but I don’t usually g ive people food poisoning, and I don’t want to start now.

Ryan:  Okay, okay, give me a list and I’ll go to the marke t.

Corrie:  And while you’re there, I’ll see what I can d o about getting rid of all of this hazardous waste!

[end of dialogue]

Ryan begins our dialogue by saying, “It’s really nice of yo u to make dinner for me.  It’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked m eal.”  A “home-cooked meal” would be, of course, one that you make yourself in  your house.  Corrie says, “I’m happy to do it.  First, though, let’s see what  you have in your fridge.” So, Corrie is over at Ryan’s apartment or house and she i s agreeing to cook a meal for him, so she looks inside of his fridge.  “Fridg e” is short for refrigerator; it’s a box that keeps cold where you store or put your food .  Ryan says, “I have tons of food in there.”  Notice we say “tons of food,” it’s very common for informal English to use this idea of “tons,” meaning a lot.  A “ ton,” of course, is 2,000 pounds, but here it just means a lot of food.

Corrie then asks, “What is that?  It looks moldy.”  “Moldy”  (moldy) comes from the word “mold,” which are small green plants, really, tha t grow on things usually because they are old or wet, especially food.  Ryan says, “Oh , that’s cheese.  I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts. ”  Corrie says, “Okay, but look at the ‘best if used by’ date.”  Most food, especially fr esh food that you would put in your refrigerator for example, has a date on it aft er which you shouldn’t probably eat it.  That’s what Corrie means by the “best if used by” date, meaning this food should be used by a certain date.  “This expired  three months ago,” she

 says.  “To expire” means something has passed its time; it i s no longer able to be used.  In this case, it’s for food that is too old to be eaten; it’s no longer good.

Then Corrie says, “What about this?” pointing to somethi ng else.  Ryan says, “That’s hamburger.  Maybe you could make some spaghetti  with meatballs.” Corrie says, “Not with this rotten meat.”  “Rotten” (ro tten) comes from the verb “to rot” (rot), which means to spoil, to decay so that you can ’t use it anymore.  Rotten meat would be meat that is no longer good to eat beca use it is too old.  Corrie says that the hamburger has definitely gone bad.  “To go  bad” means to become rotten, to become spoiled, to become so that you can no longer eat it.  “To go” has, of course, hundreds of meanings in English; take a l ook at our Learning Guide for just a few more of those.

Corrie then says, “Can’t you tell by the discoloration?  M eat isn’t supposed to be gray.”  “Discoloration” is when something changes its color,  usually to indicate that there is a problem or that it has gone bad.  Ryan  says, “I guess you’re right. I bet this milk isn’t any good either, is it?”  Corrie sa ys, “Nope,” an informal way of saying no – “nope” (nope).  “It’s gone sour.”  “To be so ur” means to have spoiled, to have an unpleasant taste or smell, especially if we are talking about milk or something made from milk.  Corrie says, “you might as well  throw out this bread, too.  It’s stale.”  The expression “you might as well” is u sed to suggest that someone do something or to indicate what you should do.  “Stale” (stale) is the opposite of “fresh.”  When we’re talking about bread, stale bread would be dry and old, fresh bread would be soft and moist.  Ryan th en says, “Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?” meaning isn’t any of my food any good. This is the problem if you walk into my kitchen, I don’t have a lot that you could eat!

Corrie says, “Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks ta inted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted.”  There a re several words there that we use to describe particular kinds of food or thin gs that you eat that go bad. Let’s start with the first one about the oil.  Corrie says, “this oil (such as vegetable oil or olive oil) is rancid.”  We use “rancid” (rancid) sp ecifically to talk about oil or fat or food that has fat in it that goes bad – that spoils.  It usually will have a bad smell and a bad taste.  Corrie also says that the butte r looks “tainted.”  You could also use the adjective “rancid” when talking about butter .  But Corrie, here, is saying that the butter is “tainted.”  Here, she means th at it is not safe to eat; it is perhaps something that could even hurt you.  She says, “t he vegetables are wilted.”  “Wilted” is when a vegetable that is normall y stiff and crisp (that is, it normally is sort of hard) becomes very soft and the leaves of  it are weak.  For example if you have lettuce, which is a green food that y ou use in salads, if the lettuce is put in the heat the leaves of the lettuce – t he pieces of lettuce will wilt

 (wilt).  So she says the vegetables are “wilted,” meanin g they are no longer fresh. She also says that Ryan’s canned goods are “rusted.”  “Canne d” means it is food that you buy in a can that you then open.  “Canned goo ds” could include things like tomato sauce or corn; many different kinds of food can be purchased in a can.  But these canned goods – these canned foods are ru sted.  The actual can is made of metal, and the metal, if it is very old, can  turn brown creating something we call “rust.”  Well, you don’t want to eat  canned food that comes from the cans that are rusted, there could be something  there that could make you sick.

Corrie says, “You do have a lot of food in your kitchen, b ut it’s been here a long, long time.”  Ryan says, “I don’t like things to go to wast e.”  The expression “to go to waste” means that you don’t use it; not using somethi ng that you paid money for.  But of course, if you wait too long, well, the food will no longer be able to be eaten.  Corrie says, “I guess not,” meaning I guess you do n’t like to waste things. That’s obvious by the fact that he didn’t throw anything away.  Corrie says, “I’m still willing to make your dinner, but we’ll have to do  some shopping.  My cooking isn’t the best, but I don’t usually give people food poi soning.  “Food poisoning” is when you get very sick because of something that you have eate n.  I had food poisoning about 10 years ago, where I had to go to the  hospital because I was so sick.  I won’t tell you where I ate, although the restau rant is still here in Los Angeles.  So if you come to Los Angeles I’ll tell you whi ch restaurant you should not eat at!

Anyway, Corrie says that she needs to buy some new food so that she can prepare the meal – some fresh food.  Ryan says, “Okay, okay , give me a list and I’ll go to the market,” place where they sell, in th is case, food.  Corrie says, “And while you’re there, I’ll see what I can do about getti ng rid of all of this hazardous waste!”  “To get rid of” means to throw out.  The ter m “hazardous waste” is usually one that we apply to chemicals that are very danger ous.  Corrie is making a joke here; she’s saying that the food is old and so spoi led that it is like a hazardous waste.  “Hazardous” comes from the word “hazard, ” meaning something that could cause you harm, something that is da ngerous.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ryan:  It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me.  It ’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked meal.

Corrie:  I’m happy to do it.  First, though, let’s see  what you have in your fridge.

 Ryan:  I have tons of food in there.

Corrie:  What is that?  It looks moldy.

Ryan:  Oh, that’s cheese.  I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts.

Corrie:  Okay, but look at the “best if used by” date.  This expired three months ago.  What about this?

Ryan:  That’s hamburger.  Maybe you could make some spaghet ti with meatballs.

Corrie:  Not with this rotten meat.  It’s definitely g one bad.  Can’t you tell by the discoloration?  Meat isn’t supposed to be gray.

Ryan:  I guess you’re right.  I bet this milk isn’t any go od either, is it?

Corrie:  Nope.  It’s gone sour, and you might as well t hrow out this bread, too. It’s stale.

Ryan:  Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?

Corrie:  Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks tai nted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted.  You do have a lo t of food in your kitchen, but it’s been here a long, long time.

# Having a Temper Tantrum

This episode is called “Having a Temper Tantrum.”  When someone gets very angry, especially a young child, we often say they have a “ temper tantrum.”  This is a dialogue between Alberto and Melissa using a numbe r of different words you might use to describe this unfortunate situation.  Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alberto:  What was that ear-splitting scream?!

Melissa:  That little girl over there is having a temper  tantrum.

Alberto:  Oh, great!  The movie hasn’t even started an d that kid is already acting up.

Melissa:  I hope she’s okay.  She looks miserable.  Maybe he r parents can distract her somehow.

Alberto:  She’s fine.  She’s just looking for attention  or frustrated she didn’t get what she wanted.  If parents didn’t give in every time t heir child wanted something, kids wouldn’t throw tantrums.

Melissa:  I don’t know.  When my son was little, he used to throw tantrums when he didn’t know how to tell us what he needed.  He got  frustrated and sometimes, he would start kicking and screaming.

Alberto:  Well, I don’t think that’s the case here.  Lo ok at those parents.  They’re going to buy the girl some candy to quiet her down.  Th at’s just rewarding her for her misbehavior.

 Melissa:  What would you do instead?

Alberto:  I would set limits so that things like this ne ver happened.  In this case, I would give that girl a spanking.  It’s all about having  consequences for bad behavior.

Melissa:  Oh, yeah?  Did that work with your children?

Alberto:  Uh, I don’t have any kids.

Melissa:  That’s what I thought!

[end of dialogue]

We begin with Alberto saying, “What was that ear-splitt ing scream?!”  “To scream” is to yell or shout very loudly.  “Ear-splitting” m eans that it is a very loud sound, perhaps a sound that is very high pitched, like “Ah !”  That would be a high-pitched scream.  That might also be a bird; it’s ha rd to say!  In any case, an ear-splitting scream would be a scream that was very loud,  very high pitched, something that would hurt your ears.  That’s the meanin g of “ear splitting.”  “To split” something means to cut it in half.

Melissa says, “That little girl over there is having a temp er tantrum.”  Your “temper” is how you get mad or don’t get mad.  Usually when we say somebody has a temper, we mean that they get mad very easily – th ey get angry very easily.  A “temper tantrum” is a short period of time when a child loses control of his or her emotions by screaming, crying, perhaps even kicking ; this would be a “temper tantrum.”

Alberto says, “Oh, great!  The movie hasn’t even started  and that kid is already acting up.”  Alberto and Melissa are at a movie theater , and Alberto is complaining that this child is already acting up.  “To a ct up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to do or say things that are inappropriate .  Usually, it’s a verb we use to describe children who are behaving badly, who are  talking or doing something that they shouldn’t be doing.  We use the same  expression, also, to describe things that aren’t working properly.  You might  say, “My computer is acting up,” meaning it’s not working the way it should.  But here, when referring especially to children, it means that they are making noise  or doing things that they shouldn’t be doing.

Melissa says, “I hope she’s okay.  She looks miserable.”  “Miser able” means very unhappy, but also very uncomfortable.  If you are walkin g in the sun and you are

 sweating and it is very uncomfortable, you might say, “I’m miserable.”  Or if you’re listening to me singing and your ears are splittin g, you would say, “I’m miserable.”  Or if you have to listen to my neighbor’s chi ldren screaming, you would be miserable – trust me!

Melissa says, “Maybe her parents can distract her somehow.”  “ To distract (someone)” means to do something to change what that person is thinking about. If you are feeling sad, you might go and see a happy mo vie to distract you, to get you to stop thinking about the bad things.

Alberto says, “She’s fine.  She’s just looking for attent ion or frustrated she didn’t get what she wanted.”  “To look for attention” means to do something to get other people to notice you – to look at you.  Certain people,  adults and children, want other people to pay attention, to look at them, to th ink that they are important, and Alberto is saying that this little girl is just looki ng for attention, doing something so other people will pay attention to her.  Or, he says, perhaps she’s frustrated.  “To be frustrated” means to be upset, to  be mad, to be angry because you cannot do what you want to do, something is preventin g you from doing what you want to do.  Alberto says, “If parents didn’t give in  every time their child wanted something, kids wouldn’t throw tantrums.”  “To g ive in,” here, means to suddenly decide to do what someone is asking you to do.  So  a child says to his mother, “Mom, I want some candy,” and the mother says, “N o,” and the child says, “Mom, I really want some candy,” and the mother says, “ No.  If you keep bothering me you’re going to have to listen to Jeff McQu illan singing.”  But the child continues to say, “Mom, I really want some candy,” and  finally the parent, the mother in this case, gives in.  She says, “Okay, here’s some candy,” that’s to give in.  Alberto also uses the expression “throw tantrums, ” that’s the verb we often use; “he’s throwing a temper tantrum,” meaning having a temper tantrum.

Melissa says, “I don’t know.  When my son was little, he use d to throw tantrums when he didn’t know how to tell us what he needed.  H e got frustrated and sometimes, he would start kicking and screaming.”  “To kick”  means to move your legs in such a way that you try to hit someone or some thing.  “To scream” means to yell.  The expression “kicking and screaming” is use d to describe someone who is out of control, when they don’t want to do something, someone who is behaving very badly, who is acting like a child.

Alberto says, “Well, I don’t think that’s the case here,”  meaning I don’t think that is the situation here, that’s not what is happening.  “ Look at those parents,” he says, “They’re going to buy the girl some candy to quiet he r down.”  “To quiet (someone) down” means to do something so that the perso n is calmer, the person stops screaming and yelling.  Alberto says, “That’s j ust rewarding her for

 her misbehavior.”  “To reward (someone)” means do someth ing nice or give someone something as a way to thank her for doing someth ing that was good. But of course, this girl didn’t do something that was; sh e did something that was bad.  Bad behavior is called “misbehavior.”  Alberto is saying that the parents are rewarding their child for doing something wrong – f or misbehaving, which, of course, will just cause her to misbehave again in the futu re.

Melissa says, “What would you do instead?”  Alberto says, “I would set limits so that things like this never happened.”  “To set limits” m eans to make rules and tell, in this case, the child what they can and cannot d o.  The word “limit” has several different meanings in English; take a look at ou r Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Alberto says, “In this case, I w ould give that girl a spanking.”  “To spank (spank) (someone)” is to hit someone,  usually a child, lightly when they have done something wrong, usually on t heir bottom (on their butt; on their rear).  A parent would take their han d and hit the child in their buttocks (in their rear) lightly, we hope – not too stro ng, it is a child after all. Spanking is very controversial; some parents believe that yo u should never do that to your child, other parents don’t agree.  Albert o says, “It’s all about having consequences for bad behavior.”  “Consequence” is a result,  something that happens because of something else.  So, Alberto is saying that if the child does something wrong, something bad has to happen to the ch ild; there must be consequences.

Melissa says, “Oh, yeah?  Did that work for your children?”  Alberto says, “Uh, I don’t have any kids (I don’t have any children).”  So he’ s giving advice about how to take care of children even though he doesn’t have an y himself.  Melissa says, “That’s what I thought!” meaning I knew that, I knew that what you were saying was not based on any experience.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alberto:  What was that ear-splitting scream?!

Melissa:  That little girl over there is having a temper  tantrum.

Alberto:  Oh, great!  The movie hasn’t even started an d that kid is already acting up.

Melissa:  I hope she’s okay.  She looks miserable.  Maybe he r parents can distract her somehow.

 Alberto:  She’s fine.  She’s just looking for attention  or frustrated she didn’t get what she wanted.  If parents didn’t give in every time t heir child wanted something, kids wouldn’t throw tantrums.

Melissa:  I don’t know.  When my son was little, he used to throw tantrums when he didn’t know how to tell us what he needed.  He got  frustrated and sometimes, he would start kicking and screaming.

# Importing and Exporting Goods

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 92: Importing and Exporting Goods.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 492.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Importing and Exporting Goods.”  It’s a dialogue between Giselle and Brian that’s going to use a lot of business vocabulary related to companies that “import,” bring goods – bring things (pr oducts) into a country, and those that “export,” send those products to be sold in oth er countries.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Giselle:  Good morning, Brian.  This is Giselle calling from Intergroup in Kansas City.

Brian:  Hi, Giselle.  How are you?

Giselle:  I’m great, thanks.  Listen, the reason I’m cal ling is that I wanted to touch base with you about the new proposed regulations.  Have you had a chance to review them?

Brian:  We’ve only had time to give them a cursory look, b ut I think we have a grasp on what the changes will be.  I don’t think that most of the new regulations would apply to our class of cargo.  As long as our certifi cates of origin are in order and our shipping agents are well informed of the changes, we won’t have anything to be concerned about.  Rest assured we’ll take  care of all that.

Giselle:  That’s good to hear.  Won’t the customs procedu res be different, though?  I understand that there are changes to the regulations affecting which containers we can use and how we transport our freight.

Brian:  No, lucky for us, all we need to do is to put som e additional information on our waybills and make sure our packing lists reflect the sam e information.

 Giselle:  I’m relieved to hear that.  You’ve really pu t my mind at ease, thanks.

Brian:  Don’t mention it.  While I have you on the ph one, do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions about the latest order?

Giselle:  No, not at all.  Fire away.

[end of dialogue]

Giselle begins our dialogue by saying, “Good morning, B rian.”  She’s calling him on the phone.  “This is Giselle calling from Intergroup  in Kansas City.”  Kansas City is located in either Missouri or Kansas: there’s actua lly a Kansas City, Missouri and a Kansas City, Kansas, in the center part of t he U.S.

Brian says, “Hi, Giselle.  How are you (how are you doing )?”  Giselle says, “I’m great, thanks.  Listen, the reason I’m calling is that  I wanted to touch base with you about the new proposed regulations.”  She’s saying “l isten” as a way of transitioning – of going back to her main topic.  “The  reason I’m calling is that I wanted to touch base with you.”  “To touch base with (som eone)” means to speak with someone about something, to get their opini on or to give your opinion. It’s often an expression you hear in the business world.  S omeone says, “I need to touch base with my customer,” that means they need to connect or be in contact with them, usually speaking to them, but perhaps emailing them as well. Giselle says she needs to touch base with Brian about the n ew proposed regulations (rules or laws).  “Have you had a chance t o review them?”  “To review them,” here, probably means look at them closely, read them carefully.

Brian says, “We’ve only had time to give them a cursory look. ”  “Cursory” (cursory) here means a quick look, without reading them ve ry carefully.  He says, “I think we have a grasp on what the changes will be.”  This expression, “to have a grasp (grasp) on (something),” means to understand som ething well, to believe, in this case, that you can do what is required.  When I was younger, I didn’t have a grasp on how to talk to women, and ther efore, women didn’t talk to me!

Brian says, “I don’t think that most of the new regulat ions would apply to our class of cargo.”  “Class,” here, means kind or type or classifi cation.  “Class” has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  “Cargo” (cargo) is something t hat is carried usually in a truck, a plane, or a ship so that it can be sold somewher e else.  Another word we use for “cargo” use “freight” (freight).  So when one country – one company decides to sell things that they make to another country or  another company in

 another country, they would have to send that product – se nd those things that they are selling, and when they send them they would be  “cargo.”  They would be sent in a plane, a train, an automobile, a truck, or a ship – probably not an automobile.

Giselle is asking, then, about regulations that are rela ted somehow to importing and exporting.  “To import” means to buy things from co mpanies in another country, usually to sell in your country.  “To export” is the opposite, to sell things to a company in another country so they can sell those thin gs to their customers.

Brian says, “As long as our certificates of origin are in o rder and our shipping agents are well informed of the changes, we won’t ha ve anything to be concerned about.”  Your “certificate of origin” is a docu ment that states where something was made – where a product was made.  It’s used  when something is sold and transported internationally.  So if I make, say,  a CD, a compact disc of my singing, I would, if I were going to sell it in an other country – and of course, I would want to – I would have to have a certificate of origin.  “Origin” is where something is from; a “certificate” is just a piece of pa per that gives that information.  Well, Brian is saying that as long as our  certificates of origin are in order, meaning under this condition, if this is true –  if our certificates of origin are in order, then we don’t have anything to worry about.   The expression “in order” here means correct and organized as needed – if our certi ficates are done right, done correctly.  “Order” has several different meanings in  English; take a look at our Learning Guide, once again, for some additional e xplanations.

Brian also talks about the shipping agents.  “To ship (som ething)” as a verb means to send it somewhere, to mail it or to send it by some form of transportation.  An “agent” is a person who is responsib le for doing something, someone who represents your company.  So, a “shipping agen t” is a person whose job is to make sure that products can be sent from on e country to another; someone who looks at all the regulations, for example.  Brian is saying as long as the shipping agents are “well informed,” meaning th ey know what’s going on, we won’t have anything to be concerned about.  “Rest assu red we’ll take care of all that.”  The expression “rest assured” is used to mean t hat the other person doesn’t have to worry, everything is under control.  It’s so mething that you say to someone else in order for them to have confidence in you,  for them to know that you are going to take care of this problem.

Giselle says, “That’s good to hear (I’m glad).  Won’t the customs procedures be different, though?”  “Customs” is the agency or office of a government that looks at things – “inspects” things, we would say, that come i nto a country, looking for things that are not allowed and possibly collecting taxes on certain things.

 Usually you have to talk to someone from customs and someon e from immigration when you go into a new country.  Giselle says,  “I understand that there are changes to the regulations affecting which cont ainers we can use and how we transport our freight.”  A “container” is just  something that holds something else.  A box is a container; a bottle can be a container for soda or milk, and so forth – or beer, which is just like milk, or as important!  Giselle says that she’s worried about the changes that will affect ho w they transport their freight.  “Freight,” you’ll remember, is the same as “ca rgo.”  It’s the product that you are shipping from one place to another.

Brian says, “No, lucky for us (fortunately), all we need to  do is to put some additional information on our waybills and make sure ou r packing lists reflect the same information.”  A “waybill” (waybill – one word) is a piece of paper with information about what you are sending, how much it we ighs, and how much it is worth – how much money it is worth.  A “packing list” is a  piece of paper that says what’s inside the box or the container.

Giselle then says, “I’m relieved to hear that.  You’ve pu t my mind at ease.”  “To put (someone’s) mind at ease” (ease) means to make someon e feel more comfortable, to make someone feel calmer, to make someone  feel that there is no longer anything to worry about.

Brian says, “Don’t mention it,” meaning it’s no big dea l, that’s my job.  “While I have you on the phone,” he says (since I’m talking to you a nyway), “do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions about the latest order ?”  Giselle says, “No, not at all.  Fire away.”  “Fire away” is a somewhat inform al expression used to let another person know that you are ready for his or her q uestions or you are ready to hear what that other person has to say.  It can also be used in a business context as well.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Giselle:  Good morning, Brian.  This is Giselle calling from Intergroup in Kansas City.

Brian:  Hi, Giselle.  How are you?

Giselle:  I’m great, thanks.  Listen, the reason I’m cal ling is that I wanted to touch base with you about the new proposed regulations.  Have you had a chance to review them?

 Brian:  We’ve only had time to give them a cursory look, b ut I think we have a grasp on what the changes will be.  I don’t think that most of the new regulations would apply to our class of cargo.

# Ordering at a Sandwich Shop

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 93: Ordering at a Sandwich Shop.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 493.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between someone who works at a  “sandwich shop,” a restaurant that sells sandwiches, and a customer named Jared .  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Employee:  Welcome to Grubway.  What can I get for you?

Jared:  I’m still deciding.  I’m trying to lose weight a nd I hear that eating a sandwich for lunch every day will help me do that.  Do you  guys have a BLT or a club?

Employee:  We don’t have a BLT, but we do have a ham o r turkey club.

Jared:  Okay, I’ll take the club.

Employee:  Ham or turkey?

Jared:  Can I get half and half, or better yet, can I  get double ham and double turkey?

Employee:  Sure, no problem.

Jared:  I’d like cheese on that, too.

Employee:  Would you like your bread toasted and the ch eese melted?

Jared:  Uh, sure.

 Employee:  What else would you like on your sandwich, the  works?

Jared:  What comes with the works?

Employee:  It includes lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bell pe ppers, olives, and pickles, and any spreads, condiments, or seasonings you’d like.

Jared:  Oh, okay.  I’ll have the works, but hold the pickle s and olives.  I’d like mayonnaise on the side, too, please.  You know what?  I ’d like to add some chicken to that.

Employee:  That’ll be $1.20 additional.

Jared:  That’s fine.  I’d also like extra cheese, and wh y don’t you add some roast beef, too?

Employee:  Okay, I can do that.  Will that be all?

Jared:  Yeah, but while you’re at it, throw in two ba gs of chips and a couple of cookies.

Employee:  Okay, I can ring you up down here.

Jared:  Hey, tell me, how long before I start losing we ight?

Employee:  Well, that’s hard to say.  You may want to lo ok at the nutritional information chart to determine that.

Jared:  Nah, I can already feel the pounds coming off!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the employee at the sandwich sh op saying to Jared, the customer, “Welcome to Grubway.”  There’s a famous sandwich shop here in the United States called Subway.  It’s a chain; that is, the re are many different restaurants like this where you can go and order a sandwi ch.  You can either eat it at the restaurant or do what most people do, which is have it “to go,” meaning you take it with you.

The employee asks Jared, “What can I get for you (what kin d of sandwich do you want)?”  Jared says, “I’m still deciding (I’m still thinkin g about it),” he says, “I’m

 trying to lose weight and I hear that eating a sandw ich for lunch every day will help me do that.”  A few years ago, this chain of sandwi ch shops, Subway, had a famous commercial where they had one of their customers, w hose name was Jared, come on and say that he lost weight because the on ly thing that he ate for a month or two months, or however long it was, was the  Subway sandwiches. So Jared is, in our dialogue, thinking about the same t hing.  He says, “Do you guys have a BLT or a club?”  “Guys,” here, is informal, me aning do you, people who work here.  He’s talking to a woman, so we use the t erm “guys” (plural) to refer often to both men and women, boys and girls tog ether.

A “BLT” is a sandwich with bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  BTL – bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich; obviously there’s bread with the sandwich.   A “club sandwich” is a sandwich that is made from three slices – three piece s of bread, and two or more different kinds of meat.  Usually there’s lettuce an d tomatoes and mayonnaise, perhaps other food in there; but it’s three  pieces of bread, and then two different types or more of meat inside the sandwich.   Usually it’s something like ham or turkey, perhaps chicken.

The employee says, “We don’t have a BLT, but we do have a ham or turkey club. Jared says, “Okay, I’ll take the club,” meaning that’s what I want to order.  The employee says, “Ham or turkey?”  Jared then says, “Can I get  half and half?” “Half and half” means 50 percent of one thing and 50  percent of another.  If you’re going to dinner with a vegetarian and you’re g oing to have, say, pizza, you might say, “Well, let’s get a pizza half and half, half vegetarian and half pepperoni.”  I’ll eat the pepperoni side!

Well, Jared wants the sandwich half and half, half tur key half ham, and then he says, “or better yet, can I get double ham and double tu rkey?”  “Double” means twice as much as normal.  “Double” has a couple of diffe rent meanings however. You can take a look at our Learning Guide for some addi tional explanations of those additional meanings.

The employee says, “Sure, no problem.”  Jared says, “I’d l ike cheese on that, too.”  The employee then asks, “Would you like your bre ad toasted and the cheese melted?”  “To toast bread” means to make it brown  and slightly hard; you put it next to a source of high heat, or you put it in a little machine called a “toaster.”  “Melted” means that something is solid that  becomes more like liquid. If you take a piece of cheese and put on a sandwich and t hen heat it, the cheese will melt.

Jared says, “Uh, sure.  The employee then says, “What else wo uld you like on your sandwich, the works?”  When you order a sandwich or a hamburger and

 somebody asks if you want “the works” – or a hot dog, thin king of fast foods – what they mean is that they will give you everything possibl e, everything that you could get on the hamburger, sandwich, or hot dog.  Wel l, Jared says, “What comes with the works?” meaning what does that include.  T he employee says, “It includes lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, olives, a nd pickles, and any spreads, condiments, or seasonings you’d like.”  A “spread” is a soft food or a thick liquid that you put on bread in a thin layer.  For example, you can use strawberry jelly or strawberry jam; that could be used as a spread.  You can make your own spread out of mayonnaise and perhaps some ot her food and put that on a sandwich.  A “condiment” is a powder or a liq uid that is added to food to give it more taste.  The word “seasonings” is a powder or  a dry herb, which is a small plant, that you add to something to give it more flavor.  So for example, basil and oregano are two common seasonings in food.

Jared says, “Oh, okay.  I’ll have the works,” meaning I wan t to order a sandwich with everything on it – the works.  “But,” he says, “hold  the pickles and olives.” When you are ordering food and you use the expression “ho ld,” such as “hold the pickles,” or “hold the lettuce,” you’re telling the emp loyee – the waiter or waitress that you don’t want have something that is normally part  of that dish – that is normally part of that meal.  So if you are having, say, a cheeseburger that normally comes with lettuce, you might say, “I want one ch eeseburger, hold the lettuce,” meaning don’t give me the lettuce.  There w as a famous television commercial when I was young, before the Internet was bo rn, that had a song that was part of the commercial, and for some reason I have t his weird memory of songs that are part of commercials or television programs, I’m not sure why. Anyway, the song for the commercial, what we would call t he “jingle,” was:  [Jeff sings]

Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce, Special orders don’t upset us. All we ask is that you let us have it your way. Have it your way, Have it your way at Burger King.

Thank you!  “Have it your way” means you can have your sandwich  however you want.  It was an advertisement for a hamburger restaura nt called Burger King, which is still in existence, although they don’t use that co mmercial anymore and haven’t since the 1970s.

Jared, continuing on with our story, wants the works, but he wants the pickles and olives held – he wants them to hold the pickles and o lives.  He says, “I’d like mayonnaise on the side, too, please.”  Mayonnaise “on the side,” meaning

 separated from the rest of the food.  If a sandwich nor mally has mayonnaise or mustard on it, or any other kind of food, you can ask for  it “on the side,” especially if it’s a liquid, that’s the most common use of  that.

Then Jared says, “You know what?  I’d like to add some chi cken to that.”  The employee says, “That’ll be $1.20 additional,” meaning extra.  Jared says, “That’s fine.  I’d also like extra cheese, and why don’t you add some roast beef, too?” meaning please add some roast beef, an additional kind  of meat.  He says, “while you’re at it, throw in two bags of chips and a co uple of cookies.”  The expression “while you’re at it” is a phrase used to ask some one to continue something they are doing, but do something additional.   Since the employee is getting Jared’s food, he says, “well, while you’re at it (since you are doing it anyway), also throw in (meaning include; add) two bags of chips (potato chips) and a couple of cookies.”

Then Jared asks, “how long before I start losing weight? ”  Well, of course, Jared has added all this extra food to the sandwich, so he prob ably won’t be losing any weight.  The employee says, “that’s hard to say (that’s dif ficult to determine). You may want to look at the nutritional information ch art to determine that.”  The “nutritional information” is the information about h ow many calories, how much fat, how much sodium a food contains.

Jared says, “Nah (meaning ‘no’), I can already feel the pounds coming off!”  “To come off” means to, in this case, reduce or become less.  S o he’s saying he can already feel the pounds, his extra weight in his body, com ing off – disappearing. “To come” is used with lots of different prepositions as a phrasal verb; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanatio ns.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Employee:  Welcome to Grubway.  What can I get for you?

Jared:  I’m still deciding.  I’m trying to lose weight a nd I hear that eating a sandwich for lunch every day will help me do that.  Do you  guys have a BLT or a club?

Employee:  We don’t have a BLT, but we do have a ham o r turkey club.

Jared:  Okay, I’ll take a club.

 Employee:  Ham or turkey?

Jared:  Can I get half and half, or better yet, can I  get double ham and double turkey?

Employee:  Sure, no problem.

Jared:  I’d like cheese on that, too.

Employee:  Would you like your bread toasted and the ch eese melted?

Jared:  Uh, sure.

Employee:  What else would you like on your sandwich, the  works?

Jared:  What comes with the works?

Employee:  It includes lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bell pe ppers, olives, and pickles, and any spreads, condiments, or seasonings you’d like.

Jared:  Oh, okay.  I’ll have the works, but hold the pickle s and olives.  I’d like mayonnaise on the side, too, please.  You know what?  I ’d like to add some chicken to that.

Employee:  That’ll be $1.20 additional.

Jared:  That’s fine.  I’d also like extra cheese, and wh y don’t you add some roast beef, too?

Employee:  Okay, I can do that.  Will that be all?

Jared:  Yeah, but while you’re at it, throw in two ba gs of chips and a couple of cookies.

Employee:  Okay, I can ring you up down here.

Jared:  Hey, tell me, how long before I start losing we ight?

Employee:  Well, that’s hard to say.  You may want to lo ok at the nutritional information chart to determine that.

Jared:  Nah, I can already feel the pounds coming off!

# Types of Story Endings

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 94: Types of Story Endings.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 494.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at eslpod.com to download a Learning  Guide for this episode. The Learning Guide will help you improve your English even faster by giving you all of the vocabulary words and definitions, sample sente nces with each of the main vocabulary words we discuss on this episode.  You’ll also  find cultural notes, comprehension questions, additional definitions, a nd a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

We’re talking, in this episode, about “story endings,” the way that a movie or a play or a novel might end.  It’s a conversation between H amid and Rachel, and we will use a lot of vocabulary that you might use to d escribe the ending of stories.  Let’s begin.

[start of dialogue]

Hamid:  I just finished a really good book.  I thought the characters were headed toward a tragic ending, but there was a twist near the  end, and everything turned out well.  It was so satisfying!

Rachel:  It sounds sappy to me.

Hamid:  It wasn’t sappy at all.  It was just a happy end ing.  I know what you like. You like those disaster movies with catastrophic endings wher e everyone dies.

Rachel:  At least that would be more realistic than ever yone living happily ever after.  I just saw the series finale of my favorite TV sho w.  You know what they did?  They ended the series with a cliffhanger.  Nothi ng was resolved.

Hamid:  That’s horrible!  How could they leave people h anging like that?  Weren’t you just a little mad?

Rachel:  No, I wasn’t.  The ending stayed true to the spirit of the show.  It was a dark show and the ending was equally dark.

 Hamid:  Well, I bet they ended the series that way so th ey could make a movie sequel.

Rachel:  Yeah, maybe, but I don’t care either way.  Lif e doesn’t end neatly and neither should a good story.

Hamid:  Remind me never to read any stories you write or  any movies you make!

[end of dialogue]

Hamid says, “I just finished a really good book.  I thoug ht the characters were headed toward a tragic ending, but there was a twist near the end, and everything turned out well.”  To “head toward (somethi ng)” means to advance or to progress toward something, to go in a particular dir ection.  “He is heading toward the door,” he is walking – he is moving in the d irection of the door.  Hamid said the characters, he thought, were headed toward a t ragic ending.  Something that is “tragic” is usually very sad, very unhappy.  Often a person dies when there is a tragic ending.  Hamid said, however, that there wa s a twist near the end.  A “twist,” here, means an unexpected change, something tha t happened and suddenly the story changed completely.  “Twist” has several d ifferent meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Guide f or some additional explanations.

Hamid says the ending “was so satisfying.”  Something that  is “satisfying,” here, means something that makes you feel good, because you were expecting something good and then something good happens – it wa s very satisfying.  You can also have a meal that is satisfying – food: “Oh, that  was so good, it was very satisfying.  It made me full.”

Rachel says, “It sounds sappy to me.”  “Sappy” (sappy) mean s too emotional, so emotional that it may seem a little silly, a little not  serious.  Hamid says, “It wasn’t sappy at all.  It was just a happy ending.  I know what yo u like.  You like those disaster movies with catastrophic endings where everyone di es.”  A “disaster movie” is a movie about some terrible thing that happen s, such as an earthquake, a volcano; usually some sort of natural disast er, but it could be something that is made by man – made by humans.  It coul d be the end of the world.  There was a famous movie that was called in En glish Armageddon  a few years ago; that’s a disaster movie.  Titanic  is, in some ways, a disaster movie, although it was also, I guess, a romance.  I don’t know; I’m one of the four people in the world who never saw the movie Titanic .  Hamid says that these movies have catastrophic endings.  Something that is “catastrophic”  is something that is disastrous; it’s similar to disaster.  The noun would be “ catastrophe.”  Here, the

 adjective is “catastrophic,” very bad, a lot of death, a lo t of suffering, something that is terrible.

Hamid is saying that Rachel likes these disaster movies that have terrible endings.  Rachel defends herself by saying, “At least that  would be more realistic than everyone living happily ever after.”  She says: well, that may be true, but at the very least I can say, in my defense, that these movies w ould be more realistic.  “Realistic,” here, means showing the world as it really is, showing something how it actually is rather than how you might like it to be.  This is, according to Rachel, more realistic than everyone living h appily ever after.  This is an expression; “to live happily ever after” means that e verything ends up being happy; there are no big problems.  Children’s stories – stories for young children usually end “happily ever after,” everything is resolved, e verything is happy – because no one likes to read a sad story, except Rachel, I g uess!

Well, Rachel says, “I just saw a series finale.”  A “series finale” is the last show of a certain television series.  Here in the United States, television dramas can last for years and years, sometimes three years, five years, even 20 years.  But eventually, these television shows – these series are ended ( they’re canceled; they’re stopped) and the last show is always a very importan t one, and everyone who likes the show will watch this “finale.”  The “final e” of something is the last thing, the end of something.

Rachel said she “just saw the series finale of my favorite T V show.”  She’s says, “You know what they did?  They ended the series with a cliffhanger.  Nothing was resolved.”  A “cliffhanger” is a chapter or a televisio n show or a movie that seems incomplete; it leaves people wondering what they wi ll do next, what will happen next.  This is very common for movies that you know  they want to make additional movies about the same topic, so a movie like t he X-Men  or some of the Star Trek  or Star Wars  movies.  These often have cliffhanger endings; something happens but it’s not completely resolved, you’re  not sure what’s going to happen.  This is a very common technique in movies and in television shows and in books.  Rachel says in this cliffhanger nothing wa s resolved.  “To resolve” means to complete, to finish, to decide something: “Th ey resolved their argument.”  They were fighting, they were discussing some thing, and then they resolved it; they came to a conclusion.

Well, this cliffhanger had nothing resolved; there were  still the problems of the series that were remaining.  Hamid says, “That’s horrible !  How could they leave people hanging like that?”  “To leave (someone) hangin g” means to say or do something that makes other people want to have more inf ormation, want to know

 what will happen next.  A “cliffhanger” leaves people h anging; it leaves them waiting for the next episode or the next movie or the n ext chapter or book.

Rachel says that she wasn’t mad.  She says, “The ending stayed  true to the spirit of the show.”  “To stay true to (something)” means to b e consistent with something, not to change your behavior or your action.  To do what one has always done, this is “to be true to (something).”  “Spir it,” here, means the opinions, the actions, the beliefs of a person or a thin g.  When Rachel talks about “the spirit of the show,” she means that the ideas, the  opinions of the show, the way the show was developed, the thought behind it.  Rach el says that it was a dark show and the ending was equally dark.  When we talk about the ending of a story being “dark,” we mean that it is negative; it is myst erious, perhaps even a little evil, a little bad.  That’s “dark.”

Hamid says, “Well, I bet they ended the series that way so  they could make a movie sequel.”  A “sequel” is a continuation of a show or  a movie or a book; it’s like a part two or part three of something.  Many popu lar Hollywood movies have sequels; I mentioned before the Star Wars  movies, there were many different sequels.  There’s also something now called a “prequel,” which is a movie that takes place before the time of the original movie.  Th is has also become very popular; Star Trek  and X-Men  both have had prequels recently.

Rachel says, “Well, maybe, but I don’t care either way,” m eaning I don’t care what happens.  “Either way” is a phrase used to refer to  two options at once, but only one of them will happen.  Somebody says, “We could go to a movies or we could go to the beach,” and you say, “Well, I don’t care either way,” either option – either choice is okay for me.

Rachel explains that life doesn’t end neatly and neither  should a good story. “Neatly,” here, means where everything is taken care of, everything is clean and resolved.  Hamid says, “Remind me never to read any stories you write or any movies you make!”  Hamid doesn’t like the way that Rachel l ikes her story endings; he wants to have happy endings that are resolved.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Hamid:  I just finished a really good book.  I thought the characters were headed toward a tragic ending, but there was a twist near the  end, and everything turned out well.  It was so satisfying!

 Rachel:  It sounds sappy to me.

Hamid:  It wasn’t sappy at all.  It was just a happy end ing.  I know what you like. You like those disaster movies with catastrophic endings wher e everyone dies.

# Describing Winds and Storms

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 95: Describing Winds and Storms.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 495.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  There, you can downlo ad a Learning Guide for this episode, which will help you improve your English eve n faster.  You can also take a look at our ESL Podcast Store, which has additiona l courses in daily and business English you might enjoy.

This episode is a dialogue between Ali and Mariela abo ut describing weather that has a lot of wind or where there are storms, where t here is rain and clouds, that sort of thing.  It will use a lot of vocabulary related  to the weather.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ali:  It’s just our luck that as soon as we arrive here for our island vacation, there’s a hurricane warning!

Mariela:  It’s uncanny, isn’t it?  On last year’s vacation, we crossed paths with a tornado and now this.

Ali:  Yeah, that tornado was something.  I had experie nced windstorms before with really strong gusts of wind, but it was nothing li ke that tornado.  Do you remember the way all of the windows, doors, and even wa lls rattled?  The tornado blew down power lines and uprooted trees!

Mariela:  That was terrifying.  Do you think we’ll have  another experience like that this time?

Ali:  I really hope not.  We came for ocean breezes, bu t if the hurricane makes landfall, we’ll have gale winds of up to 50 miles per hour!

Mariela:  And we’re trapped here!  What should we d o?

Ali:  We’ll just buckle down and wait it out.  With an y luck, the hurricane will miss the island altogether.

 Mariela:  With our luck, what’s the likelihood of that  happening?!

[end of dialogue]

Ali begins by saying, “It’s just our luck that as soon as we a rrive here for our island vacation, there’s a hurricane warning!”  The expre ssion “it’s just our luck” or “it’s just my luck” is a phrase we use when you are comp laining about having bad luck, using it to introduce an example of how bad you r luck is.  For example: “It’s just my luck that when I got to the store – to the  grocery store, there were no more bananas.”  I wanted to buy some bananas, but they d idn’t have any, that was just my luck.

Ali says that it’s just their luck that as soon as they arrive  for their island vacation there’s a hurricane warning.  An “island” is land surro unded on all sides by water. An “island vacation” is where you would go for a relaxing , warm vacation, Hawaii for example, or the Caribbean.  If you are living in t he United States those are two popular places to go on an island vacation.  Unfortu nately, on this island there is a hurricane warning.  A “hurricane” is a large  storm that forms over the ocean – it begins over the ocean, and it has very strong a nd dangerous winds. Here in the United States a few years ago, we experien ced Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed a large part of the city of New Orleans in the state of Louisiana in the south central part of the U.S.  Hurricanes are given names; they used to always be names of women, but a few years ago they changed  so that sometimes it’s a woman’s name, sometimes it’s a man’s name.   They alternate – they change: first a man, then a woman, then a man, th en a woman.  Not sure there’s been a Hurricane Jeff; I think that would be go od to have!

Mariela says, “It’s uncanny, isn’t it?”  Something that is “uncanny” is something that is very difficult to explain or understand, somethi ng that is very unusual or not common.  “It’s uncanny that I always meet my friend at  a local café,” even though we weren’t planning on seeing each other we ru n into each other, we would say, we meet each other unexpectedly.  I can’t expla in it – it’s uncanny. Mariela says, “On last year’s vacation, we crossed paths with  a tornado and now this.”  “To cross paths with (something or someone)” means to meet that thing or that person, to be in the same place at the same time with that person.  “I crossed paths today with my old high school science teacher,” I happened to be in the store while she was in the store.  That’s “to cro ss paths with.”

Ali and Mariela crossed pass with a tornado.  A “tornad o” is a dangerous storm that forms over land and has very strong and dangerous wi nds that blow in a circle.  Tornadoes are storms that start over the land; h urricanes are storms that

 start over the sea – over the ocean.  Here in the Unit ed States, in the central – the mid-central and the midwestern part, tornadoes are quite common.  When I grew up in Minnesota, we would often see tornadoes and  there would be tornado warnings.  They would tell people to go down into the ir basements to protect themselves because these strong storms were coming through – these tornadoes.

Ali says, “Yeah, that tornado was something,” meaning th at was really amazing, in a good way or a bad way.  Ali says, “I had experienced  windstorms before with really strong gusts of wind, but nothing like that torna do.”  A “windstorm” is a storm with very strong wind, though not as serious or as str ong as a tornado. When you have a windstorm, you have very strong gusts of w ind.  A “gust” (gust) is a sudden, strong movement of air.  It could be very qui et, and then suddenly you get this strong wind; that’s a “gust” of wind.

Ali has experienced really strong gusts of wind, but nothi ng like the tornado.  He says, “Do you remember the way all of the windows, doors,  and even walls rattled?”  “To rattle” means to make noise when somethi ng is being blown by the wind or something is moving against another object.  Whe n we have earthquakes here in Southern California, we had one just a few w eeks ago, if it’s very strong, the cups on the table will rattle.  They’ll make a noise  because the table is moving and the cup is on top of it, or the dish or what ever happens to be there.

Ali says, “The tornado blew down power lines and uproot ed trees!”  “To blow down” means that a strong wind makes something fall over .  “The tornado blew down the trees,” meaning the trees fell down because t he wind was so strong. The word “blow” has several different meanings in Engl ish, attached to different prepositions; take a look at our Learning Guide for som e additional explanations of that phrasal expression – that phrasal verb.

These winds also uprooted trees.  “To uproot a tree or  a plant” means that it takes it out of the ground so that the bottom of the p lant that is below the ground, what we call the “roots,” can be seen.  A very powerful storm could lift the tree out of the ground, that’s how strong it is.  That’s “up rooting” the tree.

Mariela says, “That was terrifying.  Do you think we’ll ha ve another experience like that this time?”  Ali says, “I really hope not.  We came for ocean breezes, but if the hurricane makes landfall, we’ll have gale winds of up to 50 miles per hour!” A “breeze” is a very soft, gentle wind, something that’s ve ry nice.  It’s a soft breeze – it’s a soft wind.  “Breeze” has a couple of diff erent meanings in English however, so once again, take a look at our Learning Gui de for some additional explanations.

 The hurricane, however, will not just have light breeze s, but if it makes landfall they’ll have gale force, or gale winds.  When we say a hu rricane “makes landfall,” we mean that the storm, which remember begins over the ocean – over the sea, comes onto the land; it arrives at the land.  A “gale” is a very strong wind associated with hurricanes.

Mariela says, “we’re trapped here!  What should we do?”  meaning we can’t get out.  Ali says, “We’ll just buckle down and wait it out.  With any luck, the hurricane will miss the island altogether.”  “To buckle d own” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stay in one place, usually while  you’re waiting for something else to happen.  “To wait (something) out” means to wait for something to finish or to end, especially something like a storm or bad weather, or simply a bad situation: “I’m going to wait it out u ntil our boss resigns and we get a new boss.”

Ali says that with any luck, if they are lucky, the hurricane will miss the island “altogether,” meaning completely, totally, entirely – “ altogether.”  Mariela says, “With our luck, what’s the likelihood of that happenin g?!” meaning we have such bad luck.  With our luck, what’s the likelihood (what’s the chance; the probability) that that will happen.  Not very likely, since Ali and M ariela seem to have very bad luck!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ali:  It’s just our luck that as soon as we arrive here for our island vacation, there’s a hurricane warning!

Mariela:  It’s uncanny, isn’t it?  On last year’s vacation, we crossed paths with a tornado and now this.

Ali:  Yeah, that tornado was something.  I had experie nced windstorms before with really strong gusts of wind, but it was nothing li ke that tornado.  Do you remember the way all of the windows, doors, and even wa lls rattled?  The tornado blew down power lines and uprooted trees!

# Driving a Company Car

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 96: Driving a Company Car.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 496.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, which will help you improve your English even fa ster.

This episode is called “Driving a Company Car.”  It’s a di alogue between Michael and Robin that uses a lot of vocabulary related to drivi ng a car for your work – for the company you work for.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Michael:  Shall we?

Robin:  Oh, this is nice.  Did you get a new car?

Michael:  No, this is a company car.  Getting to drive one  is one of the perks of my new job.

Robin:  Does your new position call for a lot of driving ?

Michael:  It does.  As the regional supervisor, I have to cover a large territory.  I’ll be visiting all of the affiliates across the state.

Robin:  Does that mean you can drive the company car anyti me, anywhere?

Michael:  Well, I’m only supposed to use it for official business since the company deducts the standard mileage allowance on their t axes, but there are ways to account for any extra miles I log.

Robin:  You mean you fudge the mileage numbers?

Michael:  You could say that.  It’s no big deal.  Everybod y does it, or so I’ve heard.  You know, I’ve been meaning to ask you.  Do you want to go with me to San Diego this weekend?

 Robin:  That depends.  Are you taking your company car?

Michael:  I was thinking about it.

Robin:  In that case, no, thanks.  I don’t want to be a n accessory to whatever rules you’re breaking.

Michael:  Suit yourself, but what’s a company perk if you can’t take full advantage of it?

[end of dialogue]

Michael and Robin are inside of a car, and Michael says, “ Shall we?”  This is a rather formal, polite way of asking someone whether he or she would like to join you in whatever you are doing; it’s used to ask someone to do something with you.  Among friends or family to say “shall we” is sort of a joke because, of course, the language would be too formal.

Michael says, “Shall we,” and Robin says, “Oh, this is nice.   Did you get a new car?”  Michael says, “No, this is a company car,” a car owned by a business but that is used usually by one employee, sometimes perhaps mor e than one, but usually one.  Michael says, “Getting to drive one (one of  these cars) is one of the perks of my new job.”  A “perk” (perk) is something that y ou get from your job in addition to money.  One of the perks of working at ESL Podcast is getting to know people from all over the world who email us, and some of whom actually have visited us here in Los Angeles.

Robin says, “Does your new position call for a lot of drivi ng?”  “To call for” is a two-word – you guessed it – phrasal verb meaning to requ ire, to need.  “Call,” as a verb, has many different meanings in English; take a l ook at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Michael respon ds that his new position does call for a lot of driving.  He says, “As the regional  supervisor, I have to cover a large territory.”  “Regional” is related to the wor d “region,” which is a larger area – a large area.  Here in the United States you have, for example, the region of the Pacific Northwest, which would be the states of Washin gton and Oregon.  So, “region” is a larger area.  In many countries, you have different provinces or states, but you also have regions that usually have more th an one province or state in them.

Michael is the regional supervisor (the regional boss), wh ich means he has to cover a large territory.  To “cover” a place or an area m eans that you are responsible for a certain area; you have to usually go to  and visit places in this

 larger area.  Many large companies that have stores have  different regions and regional managers that go around and travel to each sto re and talk with the local boss – the local supervisor of that store.  Michael says he ha s to cover a large territory.  A “territory” is, in this case, an area that is assigned to one person or to one group; it’s an area that one person or one group is responsible for.  At least that’s one meaning of the word “territory,” especially i f we’re talking about businesses.  You may have salesmen and women who work for t he same company, but they have different territories; they don’t  sell to the same people, they sell to people who live in different areas.  Michae l says, “I’ll be visiting all of the affiliates across the state.”  An “affiliate” (affil iate) is a person, business, or organization that is connected with some other business, p erson, or organization, but not necessarily a part of it, not necessarily in the same place or with the same leader.

In this case, Michael is visiting the affiliates of his compa ny – the company he works for, I should say.  Robin says, “Does that mean you can drive the company car anytime, anywhere?”  Michael says, “Well, I’m only suppo sed to use it for official business.”  “Official business” is something that i s related to your job, something you are required to do for your position – f or your particular work. That expression is sometimes used in talking about governm ent workers, people such as the police for example, who are going to a place.   They may say, “I’m here on official business,” meaning I’m here as part of my job, something I have to do.  But it can be used more generally to mean thi ngs that are related directly to your job that you are required to do.

Michael says the company he works for “deducts the standard mi leage allowance on their taxes.”  “To deduct” means to take off of, to remove from, to reduce.  The “standard mileage allowance,” here in the United Sta tes, is the amount of money that you can “claim” on your taxes (that you can put on your taxes) for using cars for your official company business.  For example, if I work for a company and I need to drive 400 miles to talk to someone about someth ing related to my company, I can use that driving as part of an expense; in o ther words, I can say this is something I had to pay for.  But you can only pay a certain amount, and the U.S. government, every year, tells you how much you ca n “deduct” (how much you can say that you spent) per mile.  I believe in 2008 it was 58 /.notdef.g0001 cents per mile, so if you drive 400 miles you could “claim” (you  could say on your tax forms) that you spent 234 dollars based on the standard mileage allowance. “Mileage” refers, of course, to miles; it’s the distance  – it’s the amount of driving that you do, the number of miles that you drive.

Michael adds, “but there are ways to account for any extr a miles I log.”  “To account for (something)” means to explain something, to have an explanation for

 something: “What accounts for the fact that all the wome n in Los Angeles are beautiful?”  The answer is that they all look like my wi fe, the most beautiful woman in the world.  I hope you’re listening honey!  B ack to our dialogue: Michael says that he can account for any extra miles that he  logs.  “To log,” here, means to write down something as it happens over time; in this case, it means the number of miles that he drives.  When he writes dow n the distance that he had to drive, that is “to log” your miles.  Sometimes the verb can just mean to actually drive; someone may say, “I logged in a lot of m iles yesterday” (I drove a lot).

Robin says, “You mean you fudge the mileage numbers?”  “To fudge” (fudge), as a verb, means to change a number slightly, usually for som e dishonest intent, when you are trying to lie to someone about something.   Someone says, “How old are you?” and you say, “Oh, I’m…um…I’m 29.”  You’re fudging your age; you’re not really 29, but you want this woman to belie ve you’re 29.

Anyway, so Robin is asking Michael if he is fudging his mile age numbers, if he’s putting down the wrong amounts.  Michael said, “You co uld say that.  It’s no big deal.”  “You could say that” means that’s probably or po ssibly true.  But he says, “It’s no big deal,” it’s not something to worry about.  He says, “Everybody does it, or so I’ve heard.”  The phrase “or so I’ve heard” is used  to show that something that you just said is something you heard from other peo ple, but you don’t necessarily know that to be true based on your own experi ence.

Michael says, “You know, I’ve been meaning to ask you.  Do yo u want to go with me to San Diego this weekend?”  Robin says, “That depen ds.  Are you taking your company car?”  Michael says, “I was thinking about it.”  Robin says, “In that case, no, thanks.  I don’t want to be an accessory to what ever rules you’re breaking.”  An “accessory” here means a person who helps  someone else do something wrong, break the law, someone who helps a c riminal.  “Accessory” has several different meanings in English however, very di fferent from this; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional expla nations.

Michael says, “Suit yourself,” meaning if you don’t want to go, that’s fine with me. This expression, “suit yourself,” is usually used when you of fer something to someone and the other person says no, and then you’re a l ittle angry.  You’re a little mad they said no, so you say, “Oh, well, suit yourse lf.  Whatever you want to do.”  Michael says, “what’s a company perk if you can’t ta ke full advantage of it?” meaning I have this company car, I should be able to use it for my own pleasure. The government, unfortunately, doesn’t agree with tha t philosophy!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Michael:  Shall we?

Robin:  Oh, this is nice.  Did you get a new car?

Michael:  No, this is a company car.  Getting to drive one  is one of the perks of my new job.

Robin:  Does your new position call for a lot of driving ?

Michael:  It does.  As the regional supervisor, I have to cover a large territory.  I’ll be visiting all of the affiliates across the state.

Robin:  Does that mean you can drive the company car anyti me, anywhere?

Michael:  Well, I’m only supposed to use it for official business since the company deducts the standard mileage allowance on their t axes, but there are ways to account for any extra miles I log.

Robin:  You mean you fudge the mileage numbers?

Michael:  You could say that.  It’s no big deal.  Everybod y does it, or so I’ve heard.  You know, I’ve been meaning to ask you.  Do you want to go with me to San Diego this weekend?

Robin:  That depends.  Are you taking your company car?

Michael:  I was thinking about it.

Robin:  In that case, no, thanks.  I don’t want to be a n accessory to whatever rules you’re breaking.

Michael:  Suit yourself, but what’s a company perk if you can’t take full advantage of it?

# Shopping for Bedding

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 97: Shopping for Bedding.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 497.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, in the State of Cal ifornia, here in the U.S. of A.

We have a website – oh, yes we do!  It’s eslpod.com.  On it, you can download a Learning Guide for this episode.  What’s in a Learning  Guide?  Well, you get all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additio nal definitions, cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a complete transcript  of this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Xavier and Crystal.  I t’s about two people who are going to buy things they need for their bedroo m; in this case, bedding. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Xavier:  Thanks for helping me decorate my new apartmen t.  Hey, where are you going?

Crystal:  I’m going to the bedding department.  Now t hat you have a new bed, you’ll need new bedding.

Xavier:  Right, okay, but can’t I just get some sheets, a  couple of pillows, and a blanket?

Crystal:  That’s only the beginning.  Oh, feel these shee ts.  No wonder they’re so soft.  They have a very high thread count.

Xavier:  Thread count?

Crystal:  You’ll need a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and  pillowcases.  Did you get a queen- or a king-size bed?

Xavier:  It’s a full-size bed.

Crystal:  Okay, you’ll need a comforter and a duvet cover, t oo, and this bed skirt will make your bed look really nice.

 Xavier:  Bed skirt?

Crystal:  Of course!  You can’t leave your mattress exposed.  That would look so tacky.

Xavier:  If you say so…

Crystal:  Wow, look at these canopies.  Don’t you think…?

Xavier:  You want to put a canopy over my bed?!  No, tha t’s where I draw the line.

[end of dialogue]

We begin with Xavier saying to Crystal, “Thanks for helpi ng me decorate my new apartment.”  “To decorate” means to make something more  beautiful by changing it or adding things to it.  Usually we’re talking about  a room in your house: “I’m going to decorate your room.”  Sometimes we use this whe n we are talking about preparing for a special event, putting things on the wa lls or putting other things in the room to prepare for a special event such as Christmas:  “We’re decorating the tree (the Christmas tree),” we’re putting things on it to make it look nice.

Xavier is decorating his apartment.  Crystal says, “I’m goin g to the bedding department.”  “Bedding” refers to things that you pu t on your bed, things like sheets and pillows and blankets; we’ll talk about all tho se in a minute.  “Bedding” is spelled (bedding).  There’s a word that’s pronounced,  in most cases, almost exactly the same – in fact, exactly the same, which is “betti ng” (betting).  In English, in normal conversation the “D” and the “T” if they are in between two vowels in a word are pronounced the same.  Although, if  someone doesn’t quite understand you they may over-pronounce it or hyper-pronoun ce it, they may say “bedding” versus “be tting.”  “Betting” refers to when you go the Las Vegas an d lose all your money, because you think you are good playing  cards or whatever. But in normal conversation: “bedding” – “betting,” sam e pronunciation.  Some English teachers try to tell you otherwise, but really th ey’re the same pronunciation in normal conversation.

Anyway, Crystal says, “Now that you have a new bed, you’ll ne ed new bedding.” Xavier says, “Right, okay, but can’t I just get some sheets, a couple of pillows, and a blanket?”  “Sheets” are large, thin pieces of material – of fabric, that you put on your bed and you lie on top of these sheets when  you are sleeping.  When you are lying on the bed, you want to keep the bed itsel f clean, and also it’s usually not very comfortable unless you have some sheets on the re.  Xavier says

 he also wants to just get a couple of pillows.  “Pillows”  are the large, soft things that you put your head on when you are sleeping.  Final ly, Xavier mentions getting a “blanket,” which is a large, thick piece of fa bric that keeps you warm. The sheet you put on top of the bed, then you lie on t he sheet, and then you put the blanket over you to keep you warm.  “Sheet” and “bl anket” have a couple of different meanings in English however, so please take a look at our Learning Guide today for some additional explanations.

Crystal says, “That’s only the beginning.”  The sheets, the pillows, the blankets – that’s just the beginning.  “Oh,” she says, “feel these sh eets.  No wonder they’re so soft.  They have a very high thread count.”  When you’r e buying bedding, especially sheets, the sheets are sometimes very high quality,  sometimes very low quality.  The good sheets – the high quality ones h ave a high “thread count.” The “thread” are the strings of the fabric that make up  the sheet, and if there are a lot of these in a small area, then the quality is usu ally higher.  It’s a better sheet if it has a high thread count.  “Thread” also refers to , for example, when you have a piece of clothing and there’s a hole in it, you want to close that hole, you use thread – little, tiny, thin, long piece of fabric.  Yo u also used thread if you are going to the doctor and having surgery and they put a h ole in your body, you’ll need surgical thread to close that.  But here, we’re no t putting any holes in your body; we’re just buying some sheets!

Xavier says, “Thread count?”  He, of course, is a little con fused, as most men are – about many things, I should say!  Crystal says, “You’ll nee d a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and pillowcases.”  A “fitted sheet” is a special kin d of sheet that has elastic in each corner.  This is like a rubber band that helps kee p the sheet on the bed so that it stays on the bed; it doesn’t move around, it is tight on the bed.  A “flat sheet” is a sheet that doesn’t have elastic in it; it’s a sheet that will move around easily.  Some people put a fitted sheet and then, on t op of that, they’ll put a flat sheet, then, on top of that, they’ll put a blanket.  You go in between the fitted sheet and the flat sheet.  The flat sheet is especially use ful if the blanket is a little rough on your skin.

Crystal says that Xavier will also need pillowcases.  “Pillo wcases” are rectangular pieces of fabric that have an opening on one end, and yo u put the pillow inside of it, so it covers the pillow.  It’s a “pillow cover,” we a lso could call it, but more commonly, a “pillowcase.”  Then Crystal asks Xavier, “Did you  get a queen- or a king-size bed?”  A queen bed is smaller than a king-sized b ed.  Xavier says, “It’s a full-size bed,” which is smaller than a queen bed.  T he things that you sleep on, called “mattresses,” come in different sizes; the king is the largest.  Actually, larger than a king is what’s called a “California king.”   I guess we people here in California need big beds – maybe because we’re so fat, I ’m not sure!

 Crystal says that Xavier will need a comforter and a duvet  cover.  A “comforter” is like a blanket; it is used to keep you warm at night.  U sually, though, it is filled with feathers or other man-made material.  It’s a li ttle bigger, usually a little thicker, or can be, than a regular blanket, which might  be a little thinner than a comforter.  A “duvet cover” is a large, rectangular piece of fabric – of material that is open at one end so that you can put the comforter insi de of it.  So basically it is like a pillowcase except it’s a pillowcase for the comforter  – for this large, thick blanket so that it doesn’t get dirty.  Many people have co mforters without duvet covers, however.

Crystal also says that Xavier will need a bed skirt to make  the bed look nice.  A “skirt,” normally, is what a woman wears on her hips that  go down to her thigh, in the middle of her leg – unless it’s a miniskirt, in which  case it goes down not very far at all!  But here, we’re talking about a “bed skir t.”  It’s a piece of fabric that goes along the bottom of the bed so that you can’t see u nderneath the bed, basically.  Usually this is something you’ll find in a hotel  or in a very fancy house; it’s not something that many people have, but it is possib le to get one, these bed skirts.

Xavier says, “Bed skirt?”  Crystal says, “Of course!  You can’t l eave your mattress exposed.”  The “mattress,” remember, is a large, thick surface that you lie on; it’s what you put the sheet on – the fitted she et.  “Exposed” means visible, shown, usually in talking about something that shouldn’t be shown or should not be visible.  So she says, “You can’t leave (you can’t have) your mattress exposed,” you don’t want people to be able to see the m attress, “That would look so tacky.”  “Tacky” (tacky) means ugly, unpleasant to look at, something that isn’t very fashionable, something that is not in good taste.

Xavier then says, “If you say so,” meaning you’re the expert.   Then Crystal says, “Wow, look at these canopies.”  A “canopy” (canopy) is a la rge piece of fabric (material) that hangs above the bed, sometimes – usually – for decoration, although it also helps keep insects away, if you have insect s in your house, little flies, for example, mosquitoes.  But it’s something you wo uld usually, again, see only in a very formal setting; not even a hotel would have that, in most cases. That’s a “canopy.”

Crystal says, “Don’t you think…?” suggesting perhaps that Xavie r get a canopy, and Xavier says, “You want to put a canopy over my bed?!  N ow, that’s where I draw the line.”  The expression “to draw the line” me ans to limit something, to indicate that you are not going to do that thing, tha t that is too much.  For example, you may be going shopping for clothing with your  wife, and she says,

 “Hold my purse,” the bag that she keeps her personal thin gs in.  So you hold her purse, and then she says, “Hold my jacket,” and so you hold h er jacket.  And then, she picks up a dress and says, “Hmm, I wonder how this looks.  Put this dress on.”  Then, the typical husband would say, “Wait a minute, I draw the line at putting on a dress,” meaning I’m not going to do t hat; I did these other things, but I’m not going to put a dress on.  Seems reasonable to me!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Xavier:  Thanks for helping me decorate my new apartmen t.  Hey, where are you going?

Crystal:  I’m going to the bedding department.  Now t hat you have a new bed, you’ll need new bedding.

Xavier:  Right, okay, but can’t I just get some sheets, a  couple of pillows, and a blanket?

Crystal:  That’s only the beginning.  Oh, feel these shee ts.  No wonder they’re so soft.  They have a very high thread count.

Xavier:  Thread count?

Crystal:  You’ll need a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and  pillowcases.  Did you get a queen- or a king-size bed?

Xavier:  It’s a full-size bed.

Crystal:  Okay, you’ll need a comforter and a duvet cover, t oo, and this bed skirt will make your bed look really nice.

Xavier:  Bed skirt?

Crystal:  Of course!  You can’t leave your mattress exposed.  That would look so tacky.

Xavier:  If you say so…

Crystal:  Wow, look at these canopies.  Don’t you think…?

 Xavier:  You want to put a canopy over my bed?!  No, tha t’s where I draw the line.

# Joking and Making Fun of People

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 98: Joking and Making Fun of People.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 498.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Download a Learning Guide f or this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentence s, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural notes, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.  All that is available o n our website.

This episode is called “Joking and Making Fun of People.”  It’s a dialogue between Dmitry and Charlene.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Dmitry:  Stan is really miffed at you.  All of that tea sing at lunch really upset him.

Charlene:  What?  I was just poking fun at him for tr ying to hit on the new, young receptionist.

Dmitry:  You called him an old goat.

Charlene:  I said that tongue in cheek.  If he didn’t find that funny, then he can’t take a joke.

Dmitry:  What about last week when you told that joke a bout fat people trying to dance and you made him the butt of the joke?

Charlene:  Everybody knows I’m the class clown around here,  and I make wisecracks about everybody.  Nobody else is as thin-skinned as St an.

Dmitry:  I wouldn’t be so sure about that.  I suggest yo u watch your back.  The next joke may be on you.

Charlene:  Why?  What have you heard?

Dmitry:  Oh, nothing.  I just think it may be time for  some payback – big time!

 [end of dialogue]

Dmitry says to Charlene, “Stan is really miffed at you.”  Stan is a man’s name. “To be miffed (miffed) at (someone)” means to be mad at someone, to be upset or angry with someone.  “Miffed” usually is a little le ss severe than mad; it’s a little less serious, perhaps.  Dmitry says, “All of that tea sing at lunch really upset him.”  “To tease” (tease) as a verb means to make jokes abo ut someone, but in a friendly way; to laugh at something someone has done, bu t you’re not trying to be mean.  It’s not something that you are doing to hur t the other person.  “Tease” actually has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that term.

Charlene says, “What?”  She’s surprised.  “I was just pokin g fun at him.”  “To poke (poke) fun at (someone)” is an expression that mean s to make jokes about someone.  However, it could be in a friendly way like tea sing, but it might also be in an unfriendly way in order to hurt that person.  the expression can be used for both cases, it just depends on the context.  Charlene, ho wever, believes that she was just teasing him, and she uses the expression “to poke f un at him” in a friendly way.

Why is she poking fun at him?  Well, because Stan was tryin g to hit on the new, young receptionist.  “To hit on (someone)” is a two-wor d phrasal verb to say something to another person that you are romantically i nterested in.  When a man comes up to a woman and says, “Come here often?” mea ning do you come to this place often, he might be hitting on her.  He might be trying to get her romantically interested in him.  Of course, that’s not a very good way to start.  In fact, that expression “Come here often?” is used now as a  joke; it’s a terrible way to try to hit on a girl or a woman.  I know, I’ve trie d it; it hasn’t worked very well! “To hit” is a verb that has many different meanings in E nglish, depending on the other words used – the other prepositions (the other ph rasal verbs).  Take a look at our Learning Guide for an explanation of a few of  those.

Poor Stan was trying to hit on the young, new reception ist.  A “receptionist” is a person in an office whose job it is to answer the phone and to welcome people as they walk into the office, if they are people who are vi siting.  So, Dmitry says, “You called him an old goat.”  That’s what Charlene sa id about Stan.  A “goat” is an animal, not a particularly attractive animal, so most people would consider that an insult, to call someone “an old goat.”  Charl ene says, “I said that tongue in cheek.”  The expression “tongue in cheek” (cheek) means as a  joke, not seriously, in a joking way.  “She made a tongue in cheek co mment about wanting to go swimming” – she wasn’t serious, she was joking.  I n this case, Stan did not think it was a joke.  Charlene goes on to say that if he didn’t find that funny, then

 he can’t take a joke.  “To take a joke” or “to be able to take a joke” means that you can laugh at yourself, you can laugh at the world.  “To not be able to take a joke” means that you are too serious, that you don’t fin d something funny; you can’t find the humor in things.

Dmitry says, “What about last week when you told that jok e about fat people trying to dance and you made him the butt of the joke?”   Dmitry is “bringing up,” or bringing to Charlene’s attention another example of something that she said that was mean, that wasn’t just teasing.  She made a jo ke about people who are overweight trying to dance, and she made Stan the butt (butt) of the joke.  The “butt of a joke” or “the butt of the joke” is the perso n about whom a joke makes fun; it is the person who is being laughed at, and her e, it usually isn’t in a friendly way.

Charlene says, “Everybody knows I’m the class clown around he re.”  The “class clown” is an expression that comes from school, where there  is someone in your class that always makes jokes, that is always trying to be funny .  When you have a group of students, there’s usually a couple of people who always want to be the funny one, the ones making jokes; this is the “class clown.”  A “clown” is someone who tries to make other people laugh, especiall y young children, usually by putting on a strange costume (strange clothes) a nd painting their face. Here, it’s more used as a general expression to be the pe rson who tries to be funny in the group, in this case at the company where Ch arlene and Dmitry work.

Charlene says, “I make wisecracks about everybody.”  A “wisecra ck” (wisecrack – one word) is a joke; it’s a funny comment, something t hat is supposed to be clever and funny.  She says that nobody else is as thin-skinned  as Stan.  To have “thin skin” is an expression that means to be easily off ended or upset, someone who can’t laugh at themselves.  Or, it could also  mean someone who cannot take criticism without being personally hurt.  the opposite is “thick skin.” If someone says, “He has a thick skin,” they mean that he’s no t bothered by criticism or by jokes; he doesn’t take it personally.

Charlene is saying that, in this case, Stan is “thin-skinne d.”  Well, Dmitry says, “I wouldn’t be so sure about that,” or I wouldn’t be so su re about that.  He says, “I suggest you watch your back.”  The expression “to watch your ba ck” means to be cautious or to be careful, to try to protect yourself fr om something that might happen to you.  The idea is that other people may try t o hurt you or attack you. He says, “The next joke may be on you.”  When a joke is “on  someone,” that means it’s about someone or that person is going to be t he butt of the joke, the person that everyone else will be joking about.

 Dmitry is saying to Charlene, “The joke may be on you” – you may be the person that we laugh at.  Charlene says, “Why?  What have you h eard?”  Dmitry says, “Oh, nothing.  It just may be time for some payback.”  “ Payback” (one word) means revenge, something that you do to another person t o get even, something bad you do to another person because they did something  bad to you.  That’s called “payback.”  Dmitry then uses the expression “big time. ”  He says, “I just think it may be time for some payback – big time!”  “Big  time” is an informal expression (not something that you would want to use at work necessarily, but among friends) that means something important, someth ing significant, in a big way.  For example, you go to Las Vegas and you gamble, be cause Las Vegas is famous for people going to gamble their money on cards or other games, and you lose a thousand dollars.  Someone asks you, “Did you lo se any money in Las Vegas?” and you say, “Oh yeah, big time!” meaning a l ot, in that case.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Dmitry:  Stan is really miffed at you.  All of that tea sing at lunch really upset him.

Charlene:  What?  I was just poking fun at him for tr ying to hit on the new, young receptionist.

Dmitry:  You called him an old goat.

Charlene:  I said that tongue in cheek.  If he didn’t find that funny, then he can’t take a joke.

# Marrying a Gold Digger

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 99: Marrying a Gold Digger.

This episode is a dialogue between Liza and Sinobu abou t the topic of people dating other people not because they love them or are  romantically interested, but because they want to get their money.  No one woul d ever do that, of course! Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Liza:  Isn’t Jesse wonderful?  I’m so glad you got to meet  him last night.

Sinobu:  Uh, he’s a little young for you, don’t you th ink?  I know you’ve had boy toys in the past, but he takes the cake.

Liza:  He’s no boy toy!  It’s true that there’s a 30-year age difference, but who cares about age when you’re talking about love?

Sinobu:  Well, he’s certainly dressed for the part, with  all of that bling.  That watch must have set him back a couple of grand, at least.

Liza:  Oh, that was a little token of my affection for o ur one-month anniversary.  I just wanted him to know how much I cared about him.

Sinobu:  Well, he certainly knows now who holds the pur se strings, if he didn’t before.  I only hope he’s not preying on you.

Liza:  How can you say that?  I’ve never met anyone more ho nest or sincere.

 Sinobu:  He has you wrapped around his little finger,  that’s for sure.  I hope, for your sake, he’s not a gold digger, or that you see his tru e colors before you make it to the altar – again.

Liza:  Oh, I knew it was a mistake talking to you about J esse.  You’re such a cynic!

Sinobu:  And you’re a hopeless romantic!

[end of dialogue]

Liza says to Sinobu, “Isn’t Jesse wonderful?”  Jesse is a man’ s name.  “I’m so glad you got to meet him last night.”  Sinobu says, “Uh , he’s a little young for you, don’t you think?  I know you’ve had boy toys in the past, bu t he takes the cake.” Sinobu is saying that Liza’s new boyfriend is too young for  her.  He talks about boy toys.  A “boy toy” is a young, attractive man whom one m ay date for a short period of time.  If you are older – if you’re older woman, or if you’re much older than the man, you date this person, but you may not be very seriously interested in them for a relationship.

Sinobu says, “I know you’ve had boy toys in the past, but Je sse takes the cake.” The expression “to take the cake” means to be the biggest,  the best, even the worst, the most shocking, the most important, the most som ething in a series or a list of things.  Usually it’s something bad that the perso n has done, or you’re saying negative about this case – this circumstance.  In th is case, Sinobu is saying that Jesse takes the cake, meaning he’s the youngest or  the most obvious example of a boy toy, not someone that Liza should be d ating.

Liza says, “He’s no boy toy!” (he’s not a boy toy).  It’s true ,” she says, “that there’s a 30-year age difference, but who cares about a ge when you’re talking about love?”  An “age difference” is the difference be tween two people’s ages. My father married my mother, who was four years younger than he; the age difference was four years.  Sometimes the age difference  can be very large; if you’re the, I don’t know, prime minister of a country, yo u might be dating someone much, much younger than you – although some peop le probably wouldn’t like that!  Anyway, Liza says there’s a 30-year ag e difference, so Jesse is 30 years younger than she is.  Here in Hollywood, thi s is not uncommon, especially for the man to be older and the woman to be  younger, but this is the opposite case.

Sinobu says, “Well, he’s certainly dressed for the part, wi th all of that bling.”  “To dress for the part” means to wear clothes that are appr opriate for what you want

 to do.  Someone may say to you, when you’re starting a ne w job, “Be sure to dress the part,” or “dress for the part,” meaning wear the clothes that are appropriate for this office, for this job.  “Bling” (b ling) is an informal expression, fairly new in the last probably 10-15 years; it means expe nsive jewelry, things that you wear such as a watch, or a if you’re a woman, ea rrings, a necklace for either a man or a woman.  Often, these are expensive p ieces of jewelry, things with diamonds in them for example, that’s called “blin g.”  It’s a very informal term; it’s common among the younger generation, I would say.  But here, Sinobu is saying that this Jesse has a lot of bling.  “That watch,” h e says, “must have set him back a couple of grand, at least.”  Sinobu is refer ring to Jesse’s watch, saying that it must have set him back a lot of money.  “To set (someone) back” means to cost you a lot of money.  “I bought a new car a nd it set me back 15,000 dollars,” for example.  That means the car cost 15,000 dollars, that’s what I had to pay for it.

Sinobu says that that watch must have set him back a couple of grand.  “A grand” means, in the U.S., 1,000 dollars.  It’s an inf ormal word, just like “buck,” which is one dollar: “How much is that?”  “It’s ten bucks.”   “It’s a thousand bucks.” A thousand bucks could also be called simply “a grand.”  It  cost him a grand or two grand or three grand.  Notice that we don’t say “t hree grands” or “two grands.”  Even if it’s plural, it just remains “grand.”  In this case, he’s saying that the watch cost a couple of grand, meaning two or three thousand dollars.

Liza says, “Oh, that was a little token of my affection for our one-month anniversary.”  “A token of your affection” is a sign or a symbol that you love someone or that you care for someone; it’s a gift – somet hing that you give that person.  A man may give his wife a necklace as a token of hi s affection – affection or love.  And if he forgets to give a token of  his affection, for example on their wedding anniversary, well, he will probably be sle eping on the couch.  Not that I’ve ever done that, of course!

Sinobu is, of course, not too impressed – doesn’t really like Jesse, and Liza tries to defend him by saying, “Oh, that watch is something is something I gave him.” Sinobu then says, “Well, he certainly knows now who hold s the purse strings, if he didn’t before.”  “To hold the purse strings” mean s to be the person who decides how much money is spent.  A “purse” is a bag that h olds money. Nowadays, many women have purses; it’s not that common for a man.  But the strings of a purse are the pieces of material that tha t you would use, in an old purse, to make it tight.  You have to loosen the strings in order to open the little bag, which is the purse.  Nowadays, modern purses don’t h ave strings; they have zippers or buttons.  But the idea here is that the perso n that holds the purse strings is the person who decides how money is going to be spent.  In this case,

 Sinobu is saying that Jesse has control of the money; he hol ds the purse strings even though it’s not his money.

Sinobu says, “I hope he’s not preying on you.”  “To prey ( prey) on (someone)” means to try to control or hurt an animal or a person who is weaker than you are. There’s another word, “pray” (pray), that is related t o saying something to God or to some divine being.  But here we’re not talking abou t religion, we’re talking about someone who’s trying to control or hurt another p erson.  Usually, that person is weaker than you are.

Liza is upset, she says, “How can you say that?  I’ve never met  anyone more honest or sincere.”  Sinobu says, “He has you wrapped aroun d his little finger, that’s for sure.”  The expression “to have (someone) wrap ped around your finger” or “wrapped around your little finger” means that tha t person controls you; that person is able to influence you, often because that person  is in love with you. Really, it’s because you are in love with them that they are able to control you. You may think they are in love with you, they may not be, but that person controls you because you love them.

So, Sinobu is saying that Jesse has Liza wrapped around his little finger.  He says, “I hope, for your sake, he’s not a gold digger, or t hat you see his true colors before you make it to the altar – again.”  Couple of different expressions there: first, “for your sake” means for your own benefit, to he lp you.  “I hope, for your sake,” meaning for your good, “that Jesse’s not a gold dig ger.”  “Gold,” here, just represents money.  “To dig for gold” means to try to fin d gold, for example, in the earth or in a rock in the mountains.  Here, however, a “gold digger” is a person who marries for money, someone who marries or dates some one so that they can get that person’s money because they are rich, or riche r than the person who is the gold digger.  It’s an insulting term; usually w e think of gold diggers being women marrying rich men, especially younger women marrying  older rich men. But here, the gold digger is a man.

Sinobu says he hopes that Liza will see Jesse’s true colors be fore she makes it to the altar.  “To se (someone’s) true colors” means to see how someone really is, to see the truth about someone.  The “altar” here refers to getting married.  In a church, in the front of the church there’s often an a ltar, especially in a Christian church.  The “altar” is where something is sacrificed, at least traditionally – in traditional religious ceremonies.  Here, however, it j ust refers to going to a church to get married, since, once again, traditionally most pe ople went to a church or a religious house of some sort to get married.  Obviously, L iza has been married before.

 Liza says, “Oh, I knew it was a mistake talking to you about  Jesse.  You’re such a cynic!”  A “cynic” (cynic) is a person who is very negative, who always thinks the worst about something or someone.  Sinobu responds by saying, “And you’re a hopeless romantic!”  A “hopeless romantic” is a person wh o wants to fall in love, who always believes the best about other people beca use they want to be loved by those people.  It’s also someone who may have bee n hurt many times in the past because they don’t consider the true colors of the person that they are falling in love with sometimes.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Liza:  Isn’t Jesse wonderful?  I’m so glad you got to meet  him last night.

Sinobu:  Uh, he’s a little young for you, don’t you th ink?  I know you’ve had boy toys in the past, but he takes the cake.

Liza:  He’s no boy toy!  It’s true that there’s a 30-year age difference, but who cares about age when you’re talking about love?

Sinobu:  Well, he’s certainly dressed for the part, with  all of that bling.  That watch must have set him back a couple of grand, at least.

Liza:  Oh, that was a little token of my affection for o ur one-month anniversary.  I just wanted him to know how much I cared about him.

Sinobu:  Well, he certainly knows now who holds the pur se strings, if he didn’t before.  I only hope he’s not preying on you.

Liza:  How can you say that?  I’ve never met anyone more ho nest or sincere.

Sinobu:  He has you wrapped around his little finger,  that’s for sure.  I hope, for your sake, he’s not a gold digger, or that you see his tru e colors before you make it to the altar – again.

Liza:  Oh, I knew it was a mistake talking to you about J esse.  You’re such a cynic!

Sinobu:  And you’re a hopeless romantic!

This episode is called “Taking Minutes of a Meeting.”  It ’s a business related episode that will use vocabulary connected to taking notes – official notes at a business meeting.  This will not be a dialogue, just me telling a short story.  Let’s get started. > I was absent at last month’s meeting, so imagine my surpri se when I found out that I had been elected the committee’s secretary!  As pa rt of my duties, I have to take minutes at each meeting.  Taking minutes means I ha ve to pay attention and try my best to transcribe what each person says, or at le ast do my best to summarize.
> At yesterday’s meeting, the chair called the meeting to o rder and I conducted a roll call.  Then, the chair went over the agenda and w e discussed old business. We needed to vote on a couple of proposals from the past  meeting, and it was my job to ask for a show of hands of those in favor of a nd those opposed to each one.
> After that was done, we went on to new business.  We ta lked about the first item of business for 20 minutes when someone suggested that we  table the topic until the following meeting, and the participants agreed.  After another long discussion about the second agenda item, we ran out of time.  the chair adjourned the meeting.
> Phew!  That first meeting taught me a very good lesson.  Never miss a meeting when new officers are being chosen!
> I begin our story by saying that I was absent at last month ’s meeting.  “Absent” is the opposite of “present,” it means you’re not there.  If you’re present, you are there.  For example: “I was present at my wedding.”  I  was actually there at my own wedding – amazing, I know!  “Absent” would be the opposite, that you were not there: “I was often absent from school.”  I say, “I w as absent at last month’s meeting,” meaning I wasn’t there, “so imagine my surpr ise when I found out that I had been elected the committee’s secretary!”  “To be elect ed” means chosen, usually through a vote for a particular job or position .  In the United States, we elect our president; we vote for him or her.

In this case, I got elected when I wasn’t at the meetin g, meaning I didn’t know they were going to vote for me, for the committee posit ion of secretary.  A “secretary” is normally a person at a meeting who writes down notes about what happened, and then types up those notes, puts them in a  Word document or prints them out, and gives them to people, usually at the next meeting.  Those notes are called “minutes.”  “Minutes” also refers to t ime; 60 seconds is one minute.  But here, when we use “minutes” (plural) in  talking about a meeting, we’re talking about notes from the last meeting that say what we did, what we decided, and so forth.

I say as part of my duties, I have to take minutes at each m eeting.  We use the verb “to take” when we talk about writing down notes ab out the meeting: “to take minutes.”  I then say that taking minutes means I have to pay attention and try my best to transcribe what each person says, or at least do my best to summarize.  “To transcribe” means to write down everythin g that is said, or to record everything that is said.  Normally, “transcribe” mea ns to write it; you could record it first and then write it down.  When we do t hese episodes of ESL Podcast, after we finish we go back and we transcribe them ; we write down everything that is said, and then we put that in our Le arning Guide.  That is what is happening here, I’m supposed to transcribe what peopl e say at the meeting. Now of course, it would be impossible to write down ever ything that everyone says, so normally what we do in writing up minutes is to su mmarize.  “To summarize” means to just say what was important, give the basic information without necessarily writing down everything that everyone said, so that’s what I have to do as the committee secretary.

At yesterday’s meeting, the chair called the meeting to o rder and I conducted a roll call.  The “chair” is the person who leads the meet ing; you can also call them the “chairperson,” or the “chairwoman,” or the “chairm an.”  Sometimes they’re just called “the chair.”  This is the person who runs the meeting – who leads the

 meeting.  “Chair” has a few other meanings in English;  take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  So, the chair called the meeting to order.  “To call a meeting to order” mea ns to formally start a meeting, to ask everyone to be quiet so that they can begin the m eeting.  That’s “to call the meeting to order,” it’s what the chair does, or the person who is running the meeting – who is the boss of the meeting, you could say.

So, the chair called the meeting to order – the chair  began the meeting, and I, as secretary, conducted a roll call.  A “roll (roll) call”  is a way to determine who is present at the meeting by calling out or naming each pe rson: “Jeff McQuillan…Rob Smith…Barack Obama,” and so forth.  If the person is there, you write down that they are there.  Usually in a classroo m, for example, if you take roll, or conduct a roll call (notice, once again, we  use the verb “to take” – “to take roll”), you would say “present.”  So, Jeff McQuillan would say “present,” Barack Obama would say “present,” and so forth, meaning you are there. Sometimes, if it’s a small meeting, you just look around  and see who’s there and you write down everyone who is at the meeting.

Then, the chair went over the agenda.  “To go over,” here, means to review, to talk about, to give the main information.  The “agend a” is the list of things that you are going to talk about in the meeting and the or der in which you will talk about them: first we’re going to talk about the budg et – finances, then we’re going to talk about making technology changes in our offi ce, then we’re going to talk about getting rid of Jeff McQuillan – because he doesn’t do his work!  Those would be items on an agenda, things that you would ta lk about.  So, the agenda is a list of the things you are going to talk about at t hat meeting.  The agenda is usually divided between old business and new business.  “Old  business” are things that you’ve talked about before but you need to continue talking about, or perhaps make a decision about.  “New business” are new top ics, things that have not been discussed before in your meeting.  Usually, you sta rt with old business.

We needed to vote on a couple of “proposals” (a couple of ideas) from the past meeting, and it was my job to ask for a show of hands of those in favor and those opposed to each one.  Let’s talk about what that means.  We needed to vote (to take a vote) on a couple of proposals from the past meeti ng; it was my job to ask for a show of hands.  A “show of hands” is a way that you can vote, with a small group of people usually.  Each person who wants to say “ye s” raises their hand. This, of course, is not a secret vote because you can see – in deed, you must see who is raising their hand in order to count the votes.  So, a show of hands is a way of taking a vote.  Usually they ask people who are “i n favor,” meaning who want to vote “yes,” to raise their hands first, then the y say those that are opposed should raise their hands.  So, “All those in favor, rai se your hand.  All those

 opposed, raise your hand,” and then you count and you se e which one is more. If you are going to just say your vote out loud, we use the words “aye” (aye) and “nay” (nay): “All those in favor, say ‘aye’.”  That means if you are wanting to vote “yes,” instead of raising your hand you would just say the w ord “aye.”  “All those in favor – aye.”  Those “opposed,” those that want to vo te “no” then say the word “nay.”  That, then, is if you are going to take what we  would call a “voice vote,” voting by people just speaking.  In my meeting, however, w e are voting by raising our hands.

After the vote was done, we went on to new business.  We  talked about the first “item” (the first thing) for 20 minutes when someone su ggested that we table the topic until the following meeting, and the “participa nts” (the people at the meeting) agreed.  “To table,” as a verb, means to dela y or postpone, to stop talking about something now but agree to talk about it  again at a future meeting.

After another long discussion about the second agenda ite m, we “ran out of time,” meaning we didn’t have any more time left to t alk more.  The chair adjourned the meeting.  “To adjourn” means to officia lly end the meeting, to let people know that the meeting is over and they can now l eave.

Finally I say, “Phew!” (phew).  That sound means that som ething is over, or that you are relieved; you are happy that some difficult thi ng has ended.  I say, “That first meeting taught me a very good lesson.  Never miss a meeting when new officers are being chosen!”  An “officer” is someone who h as an official position in an organization.  Usually, organizations have a president , a vice president, a “treasurer” (someone who takes care of the money), and a  “secretary” (someone who does the paperwork, including taking minutes at a me eting).  I’m saying here that I don’t ever want to miss a meeting when the grou p is going to elect new officers, so I can avoid being elected.

If you’re interested in business meetings, we have a special  course called “English for Business Meetings,” which you can find on our  website at eslpod.com.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal spe ed.

[start of story]

I was absent at last month’s meeting, so imagine my surpri se when I found out that I had been elected the committee’s secretary!  As pa rt of my duties, I have to take minutes at each meeting.  Taking minutes means I ha ve to pay attention

 and try my best to transcribe what each person says, or at le ast do my best to summarize.

Phew!  That first meeting taught me a very good lesson.  Never miss a meeting when new officers are being chosen!
