This episode is a dialogue between Kathy Lee and Ra shed about a factory, a place where things are made, that is not safe. Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kathy Lee: You won’t find any problems in your insp ection of our factory.

Rashed: I’m glad to hear that. Where do these stair s lead?

Kathy Lee: It’s just a level for storage. You don’t  need to see that.

Rashed: I need to inspect every part of this factor y. Please step aside.

Kathy Lee: If you insist.

Rashed: You have people working on this floor and it’s not structurally sound, and certainly not intended for heavy manufacturing.  This attic was never meant for industrial use.

Kathy Lee: It’s only temporary . . .

Rashed: There are no fire escapes, fire extinguishe rs, or emergency exits.

Kathy Lee: Well, I . . .

Rashed: None of the workers are wearing protective clothing and I see signs of child labor.

Kathy Lee: No, no, no, I wouldn’t hire anyone under age.

Rashed: I am ordering an immediate shutdown of this  factory due to flagrant violations of building code and labor laws.

Kathy Lee: But you can’t do that! We have orders to  fill.

Rashed: Not when this building is in danger of immi nent collapse.

Kathy Lee begins our dialogue by saying to Rashed, “You won’t find any problems in your inspection of our factory.” Kathy Lee, we understand from the dialogue, is the owner of a “factory” (factory). A factory is usually a place where things are made, physical things are produced. You might have a factory that makes shirts or chairs or automobiles.

An “inspection” (inspection) is when someone comes into a place and looks very carefully to make sure that all of the rules and la ws are being followed. “Inspection” comes from the verb “to inspect,” whic h means to look at something closely, carefully. Rashed says, “I’m glad to hear that,” meaning I’m glad that I will not find any problems in my inspection.

He then asks, “Where do these stairs lead?” We use the verb “lead” (lead) when we are referring to where the stairs end up, where they go. If you ask, “Where does this road lead to?” you’re asking the place to  which the road goes. In this case, Rashed is asking about the stairs: “Where do these stairs lead?” He could have said, “Where do these stairs lead to?” meaning  “Where do they go? What happens if you go up them – where will you be?”

Kathy Lee says, “It’s just a level for storage,” me aning the stairs go up to a floor or level in the building that is used to keep thing s. “Storage” (storage) refers to keeping things that you are going to use later. Kat hy Lee says, “You don’t need to see that.” Rashed says, “I need to inspect every  part of this factory.” Rashed wants to see this place where the stairs lead to.

He then tells Kathy Lee, “Please step aside.” The p hrasal verb “to step aside” means to move out of the way of someone. If you are  standing in front of something or someone and that person wants to get a t that thing, wants to look

at it, and you are in his way, the person may say t o you, “Please step aside” – please move your body so I can go through this area  or see what you are standing in front of.

Kathy Lee responds to Rashed, “If you insist.” The expression “If you insist” means if you say you absolutely have to, or if you are demanding me to do this. Rashed says, “You have people working on this floor  and it’s not structurally sound, and certainly not intended for heavy manufac turing.”

Rashed, we’re guessing, walks up the stairs and see s this level, this floor, and comments that it’s “not structurally sound.” “Struc turally” refers to the building being built in a certain way, constructed or made i n a certain way. “Structurally sound” refers to a building or a house that is buil t well, that is constructed so that it is safe, that is made so that it won’t fall down . If your house is structurally sound, it won’t fall down easily. It is built for n ormal use. It’s safe. Rashed, however, says that Kathy Lee’s factory is not struc turally sound.

The floor that Rashed is on is “not intended for he avy manufacturing.” “Manufacturing” comes from the verb “to manufacture ” (manufacture). “To manufacture” means to make something – again, to ma ke something physical, like a chair or a computer or a piece of clothing. “Manufacturing,” then, refers to the process of making something. “Heavy (heavy) man ufacturing” is making something that is very large, such as perhaps a car , or it could also refer to a large machine that is used to make something, and t he machine itself might be heavy and therefore require a building that is stro ng enough to hold it.

Rashed says, “This attic was never meant for indust rial use.” Rashed and Kathy Lee are apparently in the attic of this building. A n “attic” (attic) is an area just below the roof of a building that is not normally u sed for anything, or perhaps is used only for storage, but in Kathy Lee’s factory it’s being used to make things. That’s why Rashed says, “This attic was never meant  for,” or designed for, “industrial use” – that is, to be used to make thin gs, to be used as part of a factory.

Kathy Lee insists, however, that “It’s only tempora ry,” meaning she’s only using this part of the building for a short period of tim e. Rashed then goes on to explain why this part of her factory is not safe. He says, “There are no fire escapes, fire extinguishers, or emergency exits.” Let’s start wit h that last term, “emergency exits.” An “exit” is a way to get out of the room o r a building. An “emergency exit” is a door or window you use to escape a building th at perhaps has a fire inside of it. It’s a way of getting out of a building or a ho use quickly.

A “fire escape” is a way of getting out of a buildi ng very quickly in case of a fire. Usually we associate fire escapes with ladders that  go on the outside of a building, or metal stairs that are on the outside of a building that you use in order to get out of the building quickly if there’s a fir e.

A “fire extinguisher” (extinguisher) is a small dev ice you use to put out a fire. The phrasal verb “to put out” means, in this case, to s top the fire. “Extinguisher” comes from the verb “to extinguish,” which means ex actly the same thing – to put out a fire, to stop a fire from burning. If you hav e a fire at your house or in the building where you’re working, the firefighters wil l come and try to extinguish the fire. They’ll try to stop the fire from burning, wh ich is basically to get rid of the fire, if you will.

Rashed tells Kathy Lee why this area is not safe. S he says, “Well, I . . .” she’s trying to come up with a reason or an excuse. Rashe d continues to give reasons why Kathy Lee’s factory isn’t safe. He says, “None of the workers are wearing protective clothing and I see signs of child labor. ”

“Protective clothing” is clothing that would preven t you from getting injured. Firefighters wear protective clothing that is meant  to protect them from the heat of a fire. In some factories, the workers have to w ear protective clothing if they are, for example, dealing with chemicals that might  hurt them.

“Child labor” refers to using children, usually def ined in the United States as those under the age of 16, as workers. With some ex ceptions, it’s illegal to have someone work for your, especially in a factory, if they are under a certain age – 16 or 18, depending on the kind of work they are do ing.

Kathy Lee says, “No, no, no, I wouldn’t hire anyone  underage.” “Underage” (underage) means someone who is not old enough lega lly to do a certain activity. So, for drinking alcohol in the United States, “und erage” means under the age of 21. For working at most jobs, “underage” would mean  under the age of 16. Kathy Lee says she would not hire, or employ, anyone unde rage.

Rashed says, “I am ordering an immediate shutdown of this factory due to flagrant violations of building code and labor laws .” Rashed, who we guess works for the government and has the power to inspect fac tories, says he is “ordering an immediate shutdown.” A “shutdown” (shutdown) – o ne word – is when a business stops operating, when a business closes, e specially in the case of the government telling the business it hast to close.

A “flagrant (flagrant) violation” is a violation or  breaking of the law or rule that is obvious, that anyone can see. Rashed says Kathy Lee ’s factory has “flagrant violations of building code and labor laws.” The “b uilding code” (code) refers to the rules that governments have for the way that a house or a building must be built in order to make it safe. “Labor laws” refer to laws that regulate who can work and for how many hours and under what conditio ns.

Kathy Lee says, “But you can’t do that! We have ord ers to fill.” Kathy Lee is telling the inspector that he cannot shut down her factory because the factory has orders to fill. “Orders” refer to requests that com e from people who want to buy things from the factory. “To fill (fill) an order” means to give a company or a person what that company or person requested – to s ell the person what the person wants to buy.

Rashed says that Kathy Lee cannot fill these orders  as long as the building, the factory, “is in danger of imminent collapse.” Somet hing that is “imminent” (imminent) is something that will happen very soon.  Usually we use this adjective when we’re talking about something that is bad or d angerous that is about to happen. A “collapse” (collapse) of the building is when a building falls down or a house crashes down because of some structural probl em or perhaps because of some other accident or maybe even an earthquake.

We have lots of earthquakes here in Southern Califo rnia, where the ground moves. Well, that can cause buildings to collapse. The building basically falls down. Rashed is saying that Kathy Lee’s factory “is  in danger of imminent collapse,” meaning it might fall down quite soon, a nd that’s why Rashed wants to close the factory.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

All of our dialogues are structurally sound – or at  least grammatically sound, we hope – thanks to the wonderful work of our wonderfu l scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse.
