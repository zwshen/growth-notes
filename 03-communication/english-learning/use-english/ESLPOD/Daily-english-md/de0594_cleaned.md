This episode is called “Competition and Prizes.”  It’s a dialogue between Olga and Apollo that is going to be using a lot of vocabulary we might use when you are competing with someone – you are both trying to win something such as in a sport or a game.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Olga:  Are you going to take me on, or are you chicken?  Apollo:  Me chicken?  No way!  Bring it on!    Olga:  Okay, but get ready to get trounced.  I’m going to teach you a thing or two about how this game should be played.  Ready for some humiliation?  Apollo:  Stop trash-talking and get over here.  What are we playing for?  How about 20 or 30 dollars?  Olga:  Those stakes are too high.  Let’s say that the champion will get bragging rights.  Apollo:  Bragging rights?!  If I can’t have a cash prize, I was hoping for at least a trophy or a medal.    Olga:  Yeah, right.  You want a medal for winning at thumb wrestling?!  Apollo:  As far as I’m concerned, thumb wrestling should be an Olympic sport!  [end of dialogue]
