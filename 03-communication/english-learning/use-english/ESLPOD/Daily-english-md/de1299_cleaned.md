# Trading Insults

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,299 – Trading Insults. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,299. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful – and I do mean beautiful – Los Angeles, California. 

This episode is all about insulting or saying bad t hings about other people. This is going to be fun. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Alan: Look at you! Did you get a haircut or did you r head get stuck in a weed whacker? 

Doris: Look who’s talking. Maybe you should do some thing different with your hair, like wash it. 

Alan: Oh, burn. That would have been a nice comebac k if it weren’t so dumb. Who taught you your one-liners? A friend? Oh, I for got. You don’t have any. 

Doris: I think you’ve confused me with someone else  – you! 

Alan: You couldn’t come up with your own put-down s o you had to borrow mine? How humiliating for you. 

Doris: Not as humiliating as having to walk around with that face. I have something that’ll improve it: a paper bag! 

Alan: Oh, clever. I knew better insults when I was six years old. 

Doris: You mean the same mental age you are now? 

Alan: Give it up. Nobody can one-up me in trading i nsults. Your brain is no match for mine.  

Doris: You’re right. You’re a person of rare intell igence. You rarely show any! 

[end of dialogue] 

We begin our dialogue with Alan saying to Doris, “L ook at you!” “Look at you” is used when we are trying to say something about some one’s physical appearance, about the way he looks. Alan says, “Loo k at you! Did you get a haircut or did your head get stuck in a weed whacke r?” A “haircut” (haircut) is when, you can probably guess, the length of the hai r on your head is made shorter by someone cutting it with a scissors or so me electronic device. We would call it a “razor” (razor). I don’t need to ge t a haircut anymore because I shave my head. I use a razor on the top of my head to get rid of the little hair I have left. But enough about me – back to our dialog ue.  

Alan asks Doris – not seriously, but as a way of in sulting her or saying something bad about her – if she got a haircut or if her head  got “stuck in a weed whacker.” “To get stuck” (stuck) is a two-word phrasal verb m eaning to be put into a place or a position and unable to move or to get yourself  out of that position or situation. Here in Los Angeles, we often talk about  getting stuck in traffic – that is, being unable to move very fast in our car because t here are so many other cars on the road or the freeway.  

You could get your hands stuck, for example, in a s mall jar. Let’s say you are putting your hand into a small container or jar to get something out and then you can’t get your hand out of the jar or the container . Your hand is stuck. You’re unable to move it. Alan is jokingly asking Doris if  her hair got stuck in a “weed whacker.” “Weeds” (weeds) are small plants that gro w that you don’t want, that you want to get rid of. A “weed whacker” (weed whac ker) is a machine that is used to cut grass, especially at the end of a certa in area of grass. It’s a machine that is also used to quickly remove tall grass from  an area in your lawn or outside of a building. The verb “to whack” (whack) here mea ns to cut.  

We sometimes use a weed whacker for small areas tha t we need to cut the lawn or to cut weeds down where we can’t use a regular, what we would call a “lawn mower,” which is a machine you use to cut grass. I should mention that you should be careful with this word “weed.” Weed” in t he singular is sometimes used informally to mean “marijuana,” that kind of plant that you smoke that can cause you to change your attitude or mood, that is illega l in many places. A “weed whacker” has nothing to do with marijuana.  

Now, why is Alan asking Doris if she had her head s tuck in a weed whacker? Well, he’s saying that her haircut isn’t very good.  It looks as though someone did it as if they were cutting a lawn or cutting down w eeds. Doris responds to Alan by saying, “Look who’s talking.” That expression “Look  who’s talking” is used to say that another person who is criticizing you actually  has the same problem or the same situation. So if someone says to you, for exam ple, “Boy, you are looking  

very tired,” and the person is saying that as a way  of insulting you, you might say, “Well, look who’s talking. You look even more tired  than I am.”  

Doris, in other words, is insulting Alan right back  by saying that there is a problem with his hair. She says, “Maybe you should do something different with your hair, like” – or such as – “wash it.” Doris’s saying that Alan hasn’t washed his hair, and so his hair doesn’t look very good ei ther. Alan responds by recognizing or acknowledging that Doris has insulte d him in a clever or funny way. He says, “Oh, burn.” “Burn” (burn) here means insult – words that you use to insult – but he’s using it in a funny way, to be  funny.  

He says, however, “That would have been a nice come back if it weren’t so dumb.” A “comeback” (comeback) is something you say  right after another person insults you or says something bad about you.  A “comeback” is supposed to be funny, or we would say “witty” (witty). “Witt y” is funny in an intelligent way, in a clever way. Alan doesn’t think that Doris’s in sult to him was very clever. It wasn’t a good comeback. That’s why he says, “That w ould have been a nice comeback if it weren’t so dumb.” He’s saying that i t was a dumb comeback.  

“Who taught you your one-liners?” A “one – liner” ( liner) is a joke that is only one, maybe two sentences long. Technically a “one-liner”  should just be one sentence, but it is often two or maybe even three s entences. Alan is saying that Doris isn’t very funny. He says, “Who taught you yo ur one-liners? A friend?” Then he says, “Oh, I forgot. You don’t have any,” meanin g “You don’t have any friends” – which is, of course, another insult.  

Doris says, “I think you’ve confused me with someon e else – you!” Doris means here that Alan is really talking about himself. Ala n says, “You couldn’t come up with your own put-down so you had to borrow mine?” Doris didn’t come up with a very good comeback and Alan recognizes that. “To co me up with” is a phrasal verb or expression meaning to invent or to think of  something, especially in a creative way. A “put-down” is another word for an i nsult or another term for saying something bad about another person.  

Alan says, “How humiliating for you.” “To be humili ating” (humiliating) means to feel ashamed or embarrassed. Doris says, “Not as hu miliating as having to walk around with that face. I have something that will i mprove it: A paper bag.” Alan says it’s humiliating for Doris to not be able to b e clever or original. Doris responds that it’s more humiliating for Alan to be so ugly. That’s what she means by saying “walking around with that face.” She says  she has something that will improve Alan’s face: a paper bag. Doris is saying t hat Alan is so ugly he should put a bag over his head.   

 Alan says, “Oh, clever.” “Clever” (clever) means fu nny, creative, very smart in an unexpected way, in this case. But Alan here is bein g sarcastic – that is, he doesn’t really think Doris is clever. He’s saying t hat to mean the opposite, in fact, that she isn’t very clever. He says, “I knew better  insults when I was six years old,” meaning he was better or could do better insu lts, funnier insults, when he was a child.  

Doris says, “You mean the same mental age you are n ow?” Your “mental (mental) age” is how old your mind is, which really  means how intelligent you are. Your body can be a certain physical age, but if you  have problems in your brain, your mental age – that is, your intelligence – migh t be much lower. That is, you’re not as smart as your body age, I guess you could sa y. 

Alan then says to Doris, “Give it up.” The expressi on “to give it up” means to stop, especially to stop trying when something is t oo difficult. Alan then says, “Nobody can one-up me.” “To one-up” someone means t o do something better than another person, usually right after that perso n does it. So you, for example, make a wonderful meal, and then your friend decides  to one-up you. He’s going to cook a meal even better than you did.  

Alan tells Doris that no one can one-up him in “tra ding insults.” “To trade” (trade) here means to exchange something. So, I insult you and you insult me. Alan says, “Your brain is no match for mine.” The expres sion “not to be a match” (match) for something or someone means it’s not as good as something else or someone else. If I say, “Your team is no match for my team,” I mean that my team is better than your team. Your team is worse t han my team. Alan says that Doris’s brain is no match for his brain.  

Doris says, “You’re right. You’re a person of rare intelligence.” “Intelligence” is how smart you are. “Rare” (rare) means unusual or n ot very common. Doris then says, “You rarely show any!” meaning you very infre quently, or not very often, have any intelligence. So Doris is trying to insult  Alan back by saying that he is not very smart.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Alan: Look at you! Did you get a haircut or did you r head get stuck in a weed whacker? 

Doris: Look who’s talking. Maybe you should do some thing different with your hair, like wash it. 

Alan: Oh, burn. That would have been a nice comebac k if it weren’t so dumb. Who taught you your one-liners? A friend? Oh, I for got. You don’t have any. 

Doris: I think you’ve confused me with someone else  – you! 

Alan: You couldn’t come up with your own put-down s o you had to borrow mine? How humiliating for you. 

Doris: Not as humiliating as having to walk around with that face. I have something that’ll improve it: a paper bag! 

Alan: Oh, clever. I knew better insults when I was six years old. 

Doris: You mean the same mental age you are now? 

Alan: Give it up. Nobody can one-up me in trading i nsults. Your brain is no match for mine.  

Doris: You’re right. You’re a person of rare intell igence. You rarely show any!
