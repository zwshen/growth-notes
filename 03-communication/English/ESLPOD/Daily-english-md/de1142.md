On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Liset and Mark talking about being in the water on a boat and having, unfo rtunately, an accident. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Liset: I should never have gotten on this boat. We’ re going to sink. I know it!

Mark: Calm down. The water is a little rough today,  but there’s nothing to worry about. You have your life jacket on, right?

Liset: Oh my God, water is splashing into the boat.  We need to start bailing right now!

Mark: Don’t be ridiculous. That’s just a little sea  spray. Sit down and relax.

Liset: Look out! There’s another boat over there!

Mark: It’s just passing by. We might feel its wake,  but we’re not going to capsize. I promise you that.

Liset: How long do you think we can survive adrift on the water?

Mark: We are not going to sink. I’m telling you.

Liset: I wonder how long we’ll be marooned on an is land. I hope to see my family again someday.

Mark: All right, we’ll return to the shore. It’s cl ear that you’re not enjoying this.

Liset: I didn’t know we’d be sailing in the middle of a squall.

Mark: There’s a gentle breeze today, that’s all. I’ m sorry I didn’t wait for a completely calm day to take you out on your first b oat ride.

Liset: My first and last!

Liset says to Mark, “I should never have gotten on this boat.” Liset is regretting getting on this boat. She wishes she had not gotten  on the boat. A “boat” (boat) is a form of transportation that floats in the water. A big boat is called a “ship” (ship). Be careful how you pronounce that. Liset sa ys, “We’re going to sink.” “To sink” (sink) as a verb means for something that is floating on top of the water to go to the bottom of the water. So, if a boat “sinks ,” the boat goes to the bottom of the water – maybe the bottom of the ocean or the bo ttom of the lake. Of course, you don’t want your boat to sink.

Liset says, “I know it!” meaning I know it’s going to sink. Mark tells her, “Calm down,” meaning don’t get excited, don’t get anxious . “The water is a little rough today, but there’s nothing to worry about,” he says . To describe the water as “a little rough” (rough) means not calm, with a lot of  sudden the movements. The word “rough” as an adjective often means the opposi te of “smooth.” Here, it means the opposite of “calm.” The water is moving a round a lot, and of course that would mean the boat is moving around a lot as well.

Mark says, “You have your life jacket on, right?” A  “life jacket” (jacket) is like a piece of clothing that you wear, except it allows y ou to “float” (float) in the water, meaning you won’t sink. “To float” is the opposite of “to sink.” A life jacket usually looks like a vest. It has a very bright color. It g oes around the upper part of your body, just as you would have a regular jacket that you might wear out when it’s cold out.

Liset doesn’t seem to be paying attention to Mark, however. She says, “Oh my God, water is splashing into the boat.” “To splash”  (splash) means for liquid to rise up and hit against something, usually resultin g in several small drops of liquid – in this case, drops of water. What’s happe ning is that the water is hitting

the side of the boat, or the sides of the boat, and  perhaps is coming inside of the boat a little bit.

Liset is very afraid. She says, “We need to start b ailing right now!” “To bail” (bail) here means to use some containers, such as a bucket  or a pail, to scoop or to gather the water and throw it out of the boat so th at the boat doesn’t sink. If water begins to come into the boat, you may have to “bail ” the water out of the boat. You may need to take something to get the water out  of your boat so that your boat doesn’t sink.

Mark says, “Don’t be ridiculous” – don’t be silly. “That’s just a little sea spray.” “Sea (sea) spray (spray)” is when you get a little bit of ocean or sea water that comes into the boat after it splashes against the s ides of the boat. If you’ve ever taken a boat out onto the ocean or to the sea, you probably have experienced sea spray if you stand near the edge of the boat cl ose to the water. Sea spray, then, is just water that you may feel on your face or on your body that comes off of the sea or the ocean (the two words mean the sam e thing, “sea” and “ocean”) while you are in a boat.

Mark tells Liset to “sit down and relax,” but Liset  isn’t going to relax. She says, “Look out! There’s another boat over there!” The ex pression “look out” is usually used to warn someone that something is going to hit  him, or perhaps he is going to accidentally hit something or someone else. Lise t is worried that the boat that she is in is going to hit another boat that is near by or close. Mark says, however, “It’s just passing by,” meaning it’s just travellin g past us, travelling by us. It’s not going to hit us.

He continues, “We might feel its wake, but we’re no t going to capsize.” When a boat travels through water, whether it’s on a lake or on an ocean, often, especially if it’s a big boat, there are waves that  are produced by the boat itself – water that goes off either side of the boat that tr avels through the water, or looks like it’s traveling through the water. These are wh at we call “waves” (waves). Well, when you have a large boat, the large boat co uld produce waves. It could have a “wake” that might cause problems for the boa ts around it, the smaller boats around it. That’s what Liset is worried about .

Mark says, however, that the boat that they are in is not going to “capsize” because of the waves caused by the other boat. “To capsize” (capsize) means for a boat to turn over in the water so that the to p of the boat is actually in the water and the bottom of the boat is out of the wate r. Of course, that’s not the way you want the boat to be. What Mark is saying is tha t the wake of this larger boat

will not “capsize,” will not turn the boat that the y are in upside down. He says, “I promise you that.”

Liset says, “How long do you think we can survive a drift in the water?” “To be adrift” (adrift) means that you are floating in the  water – your boat is floating in the water, but you don’t have any way of moving on your own. You don’t have a motor or any other way of controlling or powering y our boat. Mark doesn’t answer the question directly. He just says, “We are not go ing to sink. I’m telling you.”

The phrase “I’m telling you” is when you are emphas izing something to someone who doesn’t believe you. The person doubts you, and  so you are trying to make sure that the person understands that what you are saying is true. Liset continues, “I wonder how long we’ll be marooned on an island.” “To be marooned” (marooned) means to be abandoned and trap ped on an island without any way of leaving it. This doesn’t happen very often nowadays with modern communication and other ways of finding peop le, but it could still happen.

You saw that Tom Hanks movie, perhaps a few years b ack, which I really hated. I hated that movie. I can’t go into it right now bu t I didn’t like it. I think it was called something like Castaway . In English it was called Castaway . A “castaway” (castaway) is a person who is marooned on an island . What I hated about the movie, in case you’re interested, is that at the en d of the movie . . . Oh well, I better not tell you in case you haven’t seen it. I hated the ending of the movie. Let me be very clear about that.

Anyway, we’re talking about a boating accident here , and Liset is wondering how long they’ll be marooned on an island. She says, “I  hope to see my family again someday.” Mark says, “All right, we’ll return to the shore.” It’s clear that Liset and Mark are not going to be marooned on an island and that Liset is just exaggerating, imagining problems.

The “shore” (shore) is the area of land that is dir ectly next to an ocean, a lake, or another what we would call a “large body of water.”  We might also use the word “coast” (coast) here. The United States has two coa sts. It has the West Coast (that’s where I live) on the Pacific Ocean and the East Coast, which is on the Atlantic Ocean. I’m not counting Hawaii and Alaska here, which are also of course on the Pacific Ocean, or have coasts on the Pacific Ocean.

The word “shore” usually refers to either a smaller  section or part of the coast of an ocean or to the area of land for a lake. We don’ t normally talk about the coasts of a lake. You could, however, for a very la rge lake, such as the Great

Lakes of North America – Lake Superior, Lake Michig an, and so on. I guess when I hear the word “coast,” I usually think of an  ocean, and when I hear the word “shore,” I think of a lake, although as I say,  we could use “shore” also to refer to perhaps a smaller part of the coast of an ocean or a sea.

Mark says they’re going to return to the shore beca use it’s clear Liset isn’t enjoying the boat ride. Liset says,” I didn’t know we’d be sailing” – going out into the water – “in the middle of a squall” (squall). A  squall is a very strong windstorm over the ocean that can be very dangerous. Mark say s, “There’s a gentle breeze today, that’s all.” A “breeze” (breeze) is a gentle  wind, a wind that is not very strong. A squall would be a huge storm. A breeze is  usually something you consider very pleasant. It’s a small movement of ai r, a very light wind.

Mark says, “I’m sorry I didn’t wait for a completel y calm day to take you out on your first boat ride.” A “calm (calm) day” would be  one in which there is no movement of the water or no wind. Liset, however, s ays that she doesn’t really want to go on another boat ride. She says, “My firs t and last!” meaning this will be the last time that she goes out on a boat.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Liset: I should never have gotten on this boat. We’ re going to sink. I know it!

Mark: Calm down. The water is a little rough today,  but there’s nothing to worry about. You have your life jacket on, right?

Liset: My first and last!
