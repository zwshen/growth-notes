This episode is a dialogue between a doctor and the mot her of young boy. They’re going to be talking about the problems that th is young boy has with his skin – the medical problems.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Mother:  Doctor, this is my son Danny.  I brought him i n so you could look at his rash. 

Doctor:  Okay, Danny.  Have a seat on the exam table.  H ow long have you had the rash? 

Mother:  My son has had that rash for about two weeks.  I t started out as a blister, and then it got really itchy and turned red.  Could it be an infection? 

Doctor:  I’ll need to take a closer look at it first bef ore I can tell you that.   

Mother:  I hope it’s not anything serious.  I hope it’s not skin cancer! 

Doctor:  Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  Okay, let’s ta ke a look…  

Mother:  While you’re at it, could you look at this bum p on Danny’s neck?  I think it’s a mole. 

Doctor:  That looks like a birthmark, but I’ll take a l ook. 

Mother:  And could you look at this wart?  If you remo ve it, will it leave a scar? 

 Doctor:  I’m not sure it is a wart.  Let me examine it first, and I’ll tell you what treatment I recommend. 

Mother:  Oh, and Doctor, could you look at Danny’s pimple s?  He just started getting them.  I had really bad acne when I was his age . 

Doctor:  Is there anything else? 

Mother:  Well, since you asked… 

[end of dialogue] 

We begin with the mother saying, “Doctor, this is my son D anny.  I brought him in (I brought him here) so you could look at his rash (rash ).”  A “rash” is when you have a group of red – small red marks on your skin, often times they are itchy. You feel like you need to take one of your hands and move  it rapidly across the rash back and forth to stop this feeling of itchiness.  We  would call that “scratching” the itch. 

Well, that’s what Danny has.  The doctor says, “Okay, Danny.   Have a seat on the exam table.”  The “exam table,” or the “examinati on table” – “exam” is just short for “examination” – is sort of a bed-like table in  a doctor’s office where the patient can sit or lie down so the doctor can look at the  patient.  The doctor says, “How long have you had the rash?”  Now he asked that to  the boy, Danny, but the mother responds instead.  “My son has had that rash for about two weeks.  It started out as a blister, but then it got really itchy a nd turned red.”  “To start out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to begin in a certai n way.  Especially we use the expression “to start out,” this phrasal verb, when some thing begins one way, then at the end there’s a different result; something  changes: “She started out working as a waitress in a restaurant, and after a few ye ars she was in the movies.”  Typical Los Angeles story, I guess.  Usually they cont inue to be waiters and waitresses for the rest of their lives.  But in the Hollywood version, you start as a lowly employee working at a café, and then you are  suddenly a big movie star.  I’m waiting for that to happen to me!  That’s what “to start out” means. There are actually meanings of this expression, and those ca n be found in today’s Learning Guide.  A “blister” (blister) is a small  area of your skin that is raised; it’s a little higher up than the other skin aro und it and there’s liquid inside. Typically if you are wearing shoes, for example, that are too tight and your foot is rubbing against the tight shoes you may develop – you may get a blister on your foot.  “Itchy” (itchy) we mentioned earlier; it’s the sen sation – the feeling that you want to scratch something, that you want to take your hand  and your fingernails  

 and put it over the skin, rubbing it back and forth.  Th at’s the sensation of something being itchy. 

The son has something that started out as a blister, and then it got really itchy and turned red.  “Could it be an infection?” the mot her asks.  An “infection” is a medical condition caused by bacteria entering some part o f your body.  It makes you sicker; it’s a kind of illness, we could say.  The mother  is wondering whether this rash, that started out as a blister, is an infection.   The doctor says, “I’ll need to take a closer look at it first before I can tell you  that.”  He needs to examine it. The mother says, “I hope it’s not anything serious.  I ho pe it’s not skin cancer!” “Skin cancer” is a serious disease where you have what are ca lled cancerous cells that multiply – that grow.  This happens sometimes if you get too much sun, you can get skin cancer.  Skin cancer is usually caught early, a nd if it is it’s not a problem to get rid of it; it’s not like some of the o ther kinds of cancer. 

The doctor said, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”  The  mother is worried that the son has cancer, and the doctor is telling her not to get ahead of herself.  That is, don’t start making plans or doing things before you r eally understand what you have to do.  You don’t have enough information to make  a decision yet; that’s to get ahead of yourself.  The mother immediately thinks th e worst.  The doctor says, “let’s take a look,” and again the mother interrupt s and says, “While you’re at it,” meaning while you are doing that, you are aski ng them to do something else.  In this case, the mother wants him to look at th is bump (bump) on Danny’s neck.  She says, “I think it’s a mole.”  A “bump” is a small , raised area of something; it could be on your skin.  There could be a bu mp on your desk, if there was a problem with your desk.  It’s not completel y flat or smooth.  This is a bump on Danny’s neck, which the mother thinks might be a mole (mole).  Here, a “mole” means a small, dark, usually brown mark on your skin .  It’s usually slightly raised – it’s usually a bit higher than the skin around it, though that isn’t always the case. 

The doctor says, “That looks like a birthmark, but I’ll ta ke a look.”  A “birthmark” (one word) is an area of your skin that is a different co lor than the area around it, and that’s the way it has been since you were born – your  skin has always been that way.  We call those things birthmarks.  I have a bir thmark on the back of my head, which no one could ever see until I shaved my head.  I took all the hair off of my head and there it was.  It’s kind of scary looking a ctually, but it’s okay.  I tell people it’s a tattoo, which it isn’t! 

The mother says then, “And could you look at this wart?  If you remove it, will it leave a scar?”  A “wart” (wart) is a small spot on your skin  that is dark, not usually  

 brown.  It’s raised up above the rest of the skin, and i t is typically very hard.  It’s almost like you have a very hard piece of rock on your skin.   That’s called a wart. A “scar” is what can happen sometimes when you cut you skin i f it’s a deep cut – a serious one.  Sometimes after the “wound,” the openi ng in your skin, has healed – has become better, there’s a little mark our yo ur skin where you cut it. That would be a scar.  So the doctor is being asked if h e removes the wart will that will leave a scar on little Danny’s skin. 

The doctor says, “I’m not sure it is a wart.  Let me exami ne it first, and I’ll tell you what treatment I recommend.”  Of course, the mother w on’t let the doctor actually do his job and examine the patient, Danny.  “Treatment ” is what you do to cure a disease or to fix an injury that you have; that’s how it’ s used here.  The doctor says I can’t tell you the treatment until I look at it.  The mother says, “Oh, and Doctor, could you look at Danny’s pimples?  He just started getting them.  I had really bad acne when I was his age.”  So, the mother is  having the doctor look at yet another thing, that’s Danny’s pimples.  A “pimple” ( pimple) is sometimes informally called a “zit” (zit), but “pimple” is a littl e nicer sounding word.  It’s a small, red spot often on your face that might be caused  by having too much oil in your skin.  It’s something that happens to teenagers quit e frequently, but it can also happen to adults. 

Well, Danny has pimples, and he just started getting the m.  The mother said that I had really bad acne but I was his age.  “Acne” (acne) is a skin condition were you have lots of different pimples on your skin, especially yo ur face and your neck.  Again, that’s the general condition of having pim ples; it’s called having acne. 

The doctor says, “Is there anything else?”  The mother says, “Well, since you asked.”  The phrase “since you asked” means that you have ano ther question or you have more information, but you were waiting for th e other person to indicate some interest.  You weren’t going to ask them or tell t hem, but since they asked you, well then, you are going to ask the question or give  the information. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Mother:  Doctor, this is my son Danny.  I brought him i n so you could look at his rash. 

 Doctor:  Okay, Danny.  Have a seat on the exam table.  H ow long have you had the rash? 

Mother:  My son has had that rash for about two weeks.  I t started out as a blister, and then it got really itchy and turned red.  Could it be an infection? 

Doctor:  I’ll need to take a closer look at it first bef ore I can tell you that.   

Mother:  I hope it’s not anything serious.  I hope it’s not skin cancer! 

Doctor:  Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  Okay, let’s ta ke a look…  

Mother:  While you’re at it, could you look at this bum p on Danny’s neck?  I think it’s a mole.
