Our episode today is called “Accepting Credit Cards.”  It’s a dialogue between Danny and Katy using a lot of vocabulary that we use in business to talk about credit cards and accepting them in a store.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Danny:  Are you sure we should start accepting credit cards from our customers?  We’ve always been a cash-only business.    Katy:  I think we need to for the convenience of our customers.  It won’t be as big a nuisance as you think, with this new cash register.    Danny:  The instructions say the merchant has to swipe the cardholder’s card at the POS.  What’s that?  Katy:  That stands for point of sale.  For us, that’s the cash register.  All you have to do is take the credit card and swipe it through here, making sure that the magnetic strip is facing you.  It’s simple.  Danny:  Do I have to write down the credit card number, the expiration date, and the security code on the back?  Katy:  No, the cash register does that for you automatically.  It will save you a lot of time.  Danny:  What if the customer goes over his or her credit limit?
