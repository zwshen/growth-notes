This dialogue between Greg and Anne is about someon e who doesn’t believe their doctor – who at least wants to get someone el se’s opinion, an additional opinion, about a medical condition. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Greg: Where are you going?

Anne: I’m going to see another doctor to get a seco nd opinion. My doctor diagnosed me with a serious medical condition, and I don’t want to take it at face value.

Greg: You’re second-guessing your doctor?

Anne: No, I just want to make sure he’s right. He’s  also recommending a conservative treatment for this condition, and if I  really have it, I want to be more aggressive.

Greg: Doesn’t your doctor mind that you’re getting a second opinion?

Anne: No, he even gave me a recommendation for anot her specialist.

Greg: What’s all of that?

Anne: This is a complete set of my records along wi th my test results. I’m hoping he’ll have a fresh perspective when he looks at all  of it and my patient history.

Greg: What are you hoping he’ll find?

Anne: The best-case scenario is that he’ll find tha t my doctor was wrong and that I don’t really have this condition.

Greg: If he tells you that, wouldn’t you be dubious ? You’ll have one doctor telling you that you have it, and one telling you that you don’t.

Anne: Then it would be time for a third opinion.

Greg begins our dialogue by asking Anne, “Where are  you going?” Anne says, “I’m going to see another doctor to get a second op inion.” The expression “second opinion” means you’ve gotten the recommenda tion or opinion of one person, but you want to get someone else’s opinion,  someone else’s recommendation. The expression is often used in tal king about healthcare – about medicine – when you talk to one doctor who sa ys you should do this, and then maybe you don’t like that idea, or you don’t t hink the doctor knows what he’s talking about, so you go to see another doctor and get his or her opinion.

Anne wants to go see another doctor to get a second  opinion. She says, “My doctor diagnosed me with a serious medical conditio n, and I don’t want to take it at face value.” “To diagnose” (diagnose) means to i dentify a problem, especially a medical problem – why someone is sick or what ill ness a person has. “Medical condition” refers to a disease or an illness that y ou have, some problem in your body. The expression “to take something at face (fa ce) value” means to accept something as being true, but without investigating it very much – to believe that it’s true without getting more information, without  researching it.

“Face value” is a term that we often use in talking  about money. We talk about the face value of a coin, or the face value of a ce rtain bill, a certain piece of money. Sometimes, money that’s very old might be wo rth more than what it says on the piece of money. That would be where you have  something that is worth more than the face value of the coin, or the face v alue of the bill.

So, if you have a five cent coin from, I don’t know , 1893, it might be worth more than five cents even though the face value is still  five cents. When I was growing up, we used to collect pennies, and you try to coll ect pennies from different years but also from different mints. A “mint” (mint) here  means the places where they manufactured or made the coins, and that would be i ndicated on the coin itself.

Anyway, getting back to our dialogue, Anne doesn’t believe her idiot doctor and wants to get another opinion. Greg says, “You’re se cond-guessing your doctor?”

“To second guess” means to question someone’s opini on or to question someone’s actions. Anne says, “No. I just want to make sure he’s right.” I want to be certain he’s correct.

“He’s also recommending a conservative treatment for this condition, and if I really have it, I want to be more aggressive.” “Tre atment” refers to how you try get someone better, how you try to heal someone, ho w you try to get someone to recover from their sickness or illness. A “conserva tive treatment” would be a treatment where you do the minimum. You do a small amount but not as much as you could. The opposite of conservative here wou ld be “aggressive” (aggressive). “Aggressive treatment” would be to do  the maximum, to do as much as possible to try to get the person over thei r sickness or to get the person healthy.

Greg says, “Doesn’t your doctor mind that you’re ge tting a second opinion?” Here, the verb “to mind” means to be bothered by. “ Doesn’t your doctor mind that you’re getting a second opinion?” Anne says, “No. H e even gave me a recommendation for another specialist.” A “speciali st” (specialist) is a doctor in this case, who knows a lot about one particular ill ness, one particular kind of medical condition. You might have a specialist in e ars and throats and noses. In fact, there is something called an “ear, nose, thro at specialist.” In American hospitals, these are doctors who know a lot about t hose three things. So, if you have a problem with your ears – my wife thinks I ha ve a problem with my ears – you would go to an “ear, nose, and throat specialis t.”

Greg says, “What’s all of that?” He sees something else that Anne is holding in her hand. Anne says, “This is a complete set of my records along with my test results.” The word “records” (records) has a couple  of different meanings. Here, it refers to documents or pieces of paper or, nowadays , electronic files that have information about you. “Medical records” is a refer ence to documents about your health – how old you are, how much you weigh, resul ts from medical tests you might have taken in the past, and so forth.

Anne, in fact, talks about “test results.” “Test re sults” are outcomes of exams or analyses, especially when we are referring to thing s like a blood test. The doctor takes some of your blood, and then they analyze the  blood for certain things. That would be – once you get the results, once you get what the analysis says – your test results. Anne has all this information th at she’s going to give the other doctor, the other specialist.

She says, “I’m hoping he’ll” – the doctor – “have a  fresh perspective when he looks at all of it” – all of my records – “and my p atient history.” A “fresh

perspective” means a new opinion about something, e specially from someone who has not been involved in the case or involved in the situation. If you work on something for a very long time, sometimes you can’t  see certain issues or certain problems because you’re too close to it. You’ve bee n involved with it for too long. You need to get a new or a fresh perspective – a ne w view on things, usually from someone else who hasn’t been working on the sa me thing you have.

Anne wants to get a fresh perspective on her medica l records and her patient history. Your “patient (patient) history” is a deta iled record of everything that the doctor has done for you – all of the tests he has p erformed on you, all of the drugs that he has given you, and so forth. That wou ld be your “patient history.”

Greg then asks, “What are you hoping he’ll find?” A nne says, “The best-case scenario is that he’ll find that my doctor was wron g and that I don’t really have this condition.” A “scenario” (scenario) is a situa tion or an outcome, a result. “Best-case (case)” refers to the best possible situ ation. So, a “best-case scenario” is the best possible thing that could hap pen. If you apply for a job, the best-case scenario is that they give you the job, a nd they give you a new house and a new car. Well, that probably won’t happen, bu t that would probably be the best-case scenario – the best possible thing that c ould happen. The opposite of a best-case scenario is a worst-case scenario – a “wo rst- (worst) case scenario.”

Anne hopes that the second specialist will tell her  that she doesn’t have this disease or this problem at all. Greg says, “If he t ells you that, wouldn’t you be dubious?” “To be dubious” (dubious) means to be dou btful – not to believe or not to trust someone or something. Greg says, “You’ll h ave one doctor telling you that you have it, and one telling you that you don’ t.” Anne says, quite logically, “Then it would be time for a third opinion.” It wou ld be time for her to see a third doctor, a third specialist, which I think is actual ly a good idea.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Anne: I’m going to see another doctor to get a seco nd opinion. My doctor diagnosed me with a serious medical condition, and I don’t want to take it at face value.
