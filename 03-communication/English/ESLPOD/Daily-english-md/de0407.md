This episode is a dialogue between Lyla and George abou t waiting for someone you are romantically interested in to call you back on the telephone.  Certainly an experience most of us have had!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lyla:  Okay, here’s a hypothetical.  You ask a girl for her  number, but wait two weeks to call her.  What gives?

George:  Well, that depends.  Why?

Lyla:  Well, I met this guy two weeks ago at a party.  We  spent the entire evening talking and I thought we really hit it off.  We had a  lot of chemistry and we had a ton of things in common.  He asked for my number and he said he’d call me the next day.  And then, I didn’t hear hide nor hair of h im until yesterday, 10 days after we met.  How come?

George:  What did he say when he called?  What was his p athetic excuse?

Lyla:  I didn’t talk to him.  I wasn’t home and he lef t a voicemail message.  I haven’t called him back yet.

George:  Why don’t you just call him and find out?

Lyla:  He just called yesterday and I don’t want to seem d esperate.

George:  Oh, come on.  He probably just lost your number  and found it yesterday.

 Lyla:  That’s possible.

George:  Or he had to go out of town and just got ba ck.

Lyla:  I suppose.

George:  Or maybe he was nervous about calling you and ju st got up the nerve.

Lyla:  Do you really think so?

George:  Maybe.  Or maybe he’s playing hard to get or h e’s just not that into you.

Lyla:  Oh.

George:  But you won’t know if you don’t call him back.

Lyla:  I guess that’s true.

[end of dialogue]

We begin with Lyla saying to George, “Okay, here’s a hy pothetical.”  A “hypothetical” or “hypothetical situation” is a situation that could happen or might happen but has not actually happened, so it’s imaginary.   This is the hypothetical, or hypothetical situation Lyla gives to George: “You ask a  girl for her number (her telephone number), but wait two weeks to call her.”  “ Number” has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

So, Lyla is saying what would happen if you asked a girl for her telephone number, and then waited two weeks to call her.  She sa ys, “What gives?” which is an informal expression when you want an explanation of  something that you don’t understand.  Often we use that expression when we ’re a little frustrated perhaps.  So Lyla wants to know, basically, why someone wou ld wait two weeks to call a woman whose number he’s asked for.

George says, “Well, that depends,” meaning it can be de termined by something else; it’s affected or decided by someone else.  When someo ne says “that depends,” they mean it depends on, or is affected by some other information – something else in the situation.  Then he says, “Why?”

 Then Lyla gives the real story, not a hypothetical situatio n.  She says, “Well, I met this guy two weeks ago at a party.  We spent the ent ire evening talking (we talked the whole evening) and I thought we really hit it off.”  To “hit it off” with someone means to get along very well with that person, u sually the first time you meet them; to quickly become friends with another person.   Many people who get married say that the first time they met their future h usband or wife they really hit it off.

Lyla says she hit it off with this gentleman – this man.  She says, “We had a lot of chemistry and we had a ton of things in common.”  “Chemi stry,” when we are talking about a man and a woman or romance, has to do with the attraction between two people – the romantic feelings you have for that other person.  She felt they “had a lot of chemistry and a ton of things in  common.”  A “ton,” here, just means a lot, many, or much.  Technically, a ton refe rs to something that weighs 2,000 pounds, but we use it informally to mean a lot of something.  So, “we had a ton of things,” she says, “in common,” meaning  that we shared similar interests.  “Common” has many definitions in English; take  a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lyla continues, “He asked for my number and he said he’d call me the next day (the following day, the day after).  And then, I didn ’t hear hide nor hair of him until yesterday, 10 days after we met.  How come?”  The expression  not to hear or see “hide (hide) nor hair (hair)” of someone means tha t you haven’t heard from or seen someone for a certain amount of time, usually a lon g time.  Literally, “hair” is, of course, what grows on the top of your head – well , not my head, but most people’s heads!  “Hide” is usually the word we use to desc ribe the skin of an animal, such as a cow.  But the expression, “I haven’t seen  hide nor hair,” means I haven’t seen anything or heard anything from this perso n in a long time.

At the end she asks George, “How come?”  “How come?” is a way of saying why, it’s the same thing as “what gives?” – somewhat informal expression.  For what reason, you’re asking.  It can usually be used the same as “why.”  For example: “How come you are going to the movies with him and not with me (why are you going to the movies with him and not me)?” and she says,  “Oh, well, you’re ugly!” So, that’s how come!

George says, “What did he say when he called?  What was his pathetic excuse?” When we say something is “pathetic” (pathetic), we mean i t’s irritating, it’s annoying, it’s not adequate, it’s not enough.  It’s a ve ry negative way of describing a situation or a person.

 Lyla says, “I didn’t talk to him.  I wasn’t home and he l eft a voicemail message.  I haven’t called him back yet” – I haven’t returned his call .  George says, “Why don’t you just call him and find out?” – why don’t you ca ll him and ask him why he didn’t call you for so long?  Lyla says, “He just called yeste rday and I don’t want to seem (or appear) desperate.”  Someone who is “despe rate” is willing to do anything to make something happen; someone who is very ea ger for something to happen, perhaps because you don’t have any other choi ces or options.  Lyla says she doesn’t want to seem desperate; she doesn’t want to seem as though she is the one who really wants to go out with this guy.  This is a little game that men and women play, of course.  When they first are int erested in each other, neither one wants to seem as though they need the other  person.  That’s just part of the strange human romantic reactions that we ha ve.

George says, “Oh, come on (meaning oh, be reasonable – be sensible).  He probably just lost your number and found it yesterday.”  Lyla says, “That’s possible.”  George says, “Or he had to go out of town (h e had to leave the city) and just got back (just returned).”  Lyla says, “I suppose,” meaning okay, maybe. George then gives another possible reason, “Or maybe he was nervous about calling you and just got up the nerve.”  To “get up the nerve” (nerve) means to become brave enough to do something, to get enough co urage to do something. You may have to get up the nerve to ask your boss for a r aise – for more money.

Lyla says, “Do you really think so?”  George says, “Maybe.  O r maybe he’s playing hard to get or he’s just not that into you.”  T o “play hard to get” means to act like you are not interested in, even though you are interested.  This, again, is a game that men and women play with each other – boys a nd girls as well.  You give the impression to the other person that you are n ot that interested, hoping that they’ll be more interested in you.  Some people are attracted to others who are difficult to get – who are difficult to get a rel ationship with.  You play hard to get – you act as though you don’t want to be with that  person.  The other possibility George gives is that this man is “just not that  into you.”  When we say someone is “not into” someone, we mean they aren’t inte rested in them romantically – they’re not interested in dating that pe rson.  You could say, “Oh, he’s just not that into you,” or “She’s just not that in to you,” meaning he or she doesn’t really like you.

Lyla say, “Oh.”  George then says, “But you won’t know if you don’t call him back.”  That is, you can’t find out the truth unless you cal l him.  Lyla says, “I guess that’s true.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
