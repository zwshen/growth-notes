<P>
Given a list of figures (rectangles, circles, and triangles) and a list of points in the <I>x</I>-<I>y</I> plane, determine for each point which figures (if any) contain the point.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
There will be n(Ÿ 10) figures descriptions, one per line. The first character will designate
the type of figure (``<TT>r</TT>'', ``<TT>c</TT>'', ``<TT>t</TT>'' for rectangle, circle, or triangle, respectively). This character will be followed by values which describe that figure.
<UL><LI> For a rectangle, there will be four real values designating the <I>x</I>-<I>y</I> coordinates of the
upper left and lower right corners.<LI> For a circle, there will be three real values, designating the <I>x</I>-<I>y</I> coordinates of the center
and the radius.<LI> For a triangle, there will be six real values designating the <I>x</I>-<I>y</I> coordinates of the
vertices.
</UL>
The end of the list will be signalled by a line containing an asterisk in column one.
<P>
<P>
The remaining lines will contain the <I>x</I>-<I>y</I> coordinates, one per line, of the points to be tested. The end of this list will be indicated by a point with coordinates 9999.9 9999.9; these values should not be included in the output.
<P>
Points coinciding with a figure border are not considered inside.
<P>

<P>
For each point to be tested, write a message of the form:
<PRE>Point i is contained in figure j</PRE>
for each figure that contains that point. If the point is not contained in any figure, write a
message of the form:
<PRE>Point i is not contained in any figure</PRE>
Points and figures should be numbered in the order in which they appear in the input.
