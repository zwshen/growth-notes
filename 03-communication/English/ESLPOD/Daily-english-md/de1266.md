This lesson is all about being a refugee – someone who has to leave his country. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Sara: How’s work been? 

Tarek: Really hard. Our agency is working to resett le refugees who have fled McQuillanland because of the armed conflict there. 

Sara: It must be so difficult to be displaced and h ave few possessions. 

Tarek: You don’t know the half of it. Some are in r efugee camps and some are in detention centers. They’re overcrowded and the alre ady poor conditions are deteriorating. There simply isn’t an infrastructure  to support an influx this big. 

Sara: At least they’re under protection until they can be resettled. 

Tarek: If they’re resettled. If we can’t find count ries willing to take them, they may be repatriated. 

Sara: But what if they won’t go back? 

Tarek: Then they’ll be stateless. There aren’t many  good options for asylum seekers.  

 Sara: I feel so bad for everyone in McQuillanland. 

Tarek: I totally agree. You’re damned if you leave and damned if you stay! 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Sara saying to Tarek, “How ’s work been?” meaning “How is your job going?” or “How are things at your  workplace?” Tarek says, “Really hard,” meaning very difficult. “Our agency”  – our organization within the government or private organization – “is working to  resettle refugees who have fled McQuillanland because of the armed conflict th ere.”  

A “refugee,” or “refugee” – either pronunciation is  correct, whether the accent is on the first syllable or the last – is a person who  has to leave his country, usually because of some violence or threat of violence – th at is, that person might be killed if he doesn’t leave his country, by the gove rnment or someone else in the country.  

The verb “to resettle” (resettle) means to help som eone find a new place to live. It could be in a new country, it could just be in a ne w city, or you might even use it to talk about just moving to a different house or a partment. “I need to get resettled in my new apartment.” I need to get every thing arranged so that I can live here. Here, we’re talking about “resettling re fugees” – helping people from another country come and live in our country.  

The verb form “fled” (fled) comes from the verb, is  the past tense of the verb “to flee” (flee). “To flee” means to leave a place very  quickly, especially when you are in danger. If your house is on fire, if it is b urning up, you will need to “flee” as quickly as possible. You will need to leave it as q uickly as possible. There’s another word pronounced the same in English but spe lled differently, “flea” (flea), that’s actually a little, I guess it’s an insect or  a bug, a little animal that often lives on dogs or cats, though they can also bite people a s well, but this “flee” means to leave quickly. 

An “armed (armed) conflict (conflict)” refers to tw o groups fighting each other with “arms” (arms). Now when I say “arms” here, I don’t mean the two things that come out of the top of your body with hands at the end of them. I’m referring to guns or other ways of killing people, such as bombs , that are used in a war. An “armed conflict” is really just another term for a war. So, to review then, Tarek works for an “agency,” a group that “is working to resettle refugees who have fled  

McQuillanland because of the armed conflict there,”  meaning there is a war in McQuillanland.  

Sara says, “It must be so difficult to be displaced  and have few possessions.” “To be displaced” (displaced) means to be forced to lea ve your home and live somewhere else. You may be “displaced” because of a  bad storm – maybe there’s too much rain in your area and the water ha s gone into the houses, what we would call “flooding.” That may lead to people b eing “displaced” – having to live somewhere else. “Possessions” (possessions) re fers to anything you own – your clothing, your cars, your computers, and so fo rth.  

Sara says, “It must be so difficult,” or very diffi cult, “to be displaced and have few,” or not very many, “possessions.” Tarek says, “You don’t know the half of it.” That expression, “You don’t know the half (half) of  it,” means that you don’t have the complete information. Usually it means that thi ngs are actually worse than what you know, that you don’t have the information about how bad things are.  

Tarek then describes that “some are in refugee camp s,” meaning some of these refugees are in “refugee camps” (camps). These are temporary places where people are kept when there is no other place to put  them. “Some are in detention centers,” Tarek says. A “detention (detention) cent er” is usually a place where people are forced to stay until the government deci des where they should go next, especially if they have perhaps, entered the country illegally or when the government is deciding to let or not let those peop le into the country permanently.  

Tarek says, “These places are overcrowded and the a lready poor conditions are deteriorating.” If something is “overcrowded” (over crowded), there are too many people there. What’s the difference between “crowde d” and “overcrowded”? Well, “crowded” usually refers to a situation where there  are a lot of people in a small space, but there’s enough room, I guess, for you to  be more or less comfortable. “Overcrowded” means there are too many people in a certain area or space – so many people, perhaps, that it is dangerous.  

The conditions or the situation in these places, ac cording to Tarek, “are deteriorating.” “To deteriorate” (deteriorate) mean s to get worse. He says, “There simply isn’t an infrastructure to support an influx  this big.” The word “infrastructure” (infrastructure) is used to descri be the systems or organizations, or perhaps physical structures, that allow somethin g to work properly or that allow society or a large group of people to functio n, to do what they need to do.  

We often talk about the “infrastructure of a countr y” when describing the airports and roads and public services that are available so  that people can live comfortably and have a healthy economy, but “infras tructure” can also refer simply to the organization or the physical features  of a certain place. Tarek says that there “isn’t an infrastructure to support an i nflux (influx) this big.” An “influx” is when there is a large number of people who arrive o r enter into a certain place all at once or within a very short amount of time.  

Sara says, “At least they’re under protection until  they can be resettled.” “Protection” refers to things that prevent you or s omeone from being hurt or harmed. Tarek says, “If they’re resettled,” meaning  he’s not sure if they will be, in fact, resettled. “If we can’t find countries willin g to take them, they may be repatriated.” “To repatriate” (repatriate) means to  return someone to his own country – someone who has left that country as a re fugee or for some other reason. So, if a person is “repatriated,” he is ret urned, often against his will, to the country from which he came.  

Sara says, “But what if they won’t go back?” That i s, what if these refugees won’t return to their home countries? Tarek says, “Then t hey’ll be stateless” (stateless). Someone who is “stateless” is someone without a sta te or country or nation, or at least someone who is not recognized by any country as being a citizen or official member of that country.  

Tarek says, “There aren’t many good options,” or go od possibilities, “for asylum seekers.” “Asylum” (asylum) here refers to giving s omeone safety by allowing him to stay in a country. A “seeker” (seeker) is so meone who is asking for something or looking for something or trying to get  something. The verb “to seek” means to look for, to try to find something. An “as ylum seeker” is someone who goes to another country and tries to get permission  to stay in that country, often because that person feels he won’t be safe in his o wn country.  

Sara says, “I feel so bad for everyone in McQuillan land.” Tarek says, “I totally agree.” The word “totally” here means simply “I agr ee completely.” “You’re damned if you leave and damned if you stay,” he say s. The word “damned” (damned) here means that you will suffer or bad thi ngs will happen to you. That’s why he says, “You’re damned if you leave and damned  if you stay,” meaning if you stay in McQuillanland, things will be bad for y ou. If you leave McQuillanland, things will be bad for you. There are no good choic es. There are no good options.  

Now let me just say that this is a fictional story.  Things in McQuillanland are actually wonderful, and I invite everyone to come a nd take your next vacation in beautiful McQuillanland.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
