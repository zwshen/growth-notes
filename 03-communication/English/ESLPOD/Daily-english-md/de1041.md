On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Irma and Bert about being rescued – about people who get caught, trappe d, in some place and need to have someone else to come and save them. Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Irma: Do you really think we’ll be rescued? It’s be en six hours and I’m losing hope.

Bert: It’s hard to say. I’m sure search and rescue teams are looking for us as we speak.

Irma: But what if they don’t come in time? We didn’ t bring any provisions and we’re almost out of water.

Bert: You’re afraid of starvation and dying of thir st? I think we’d die from hypothermia or exposure to the elements first.

Irma: Thanks. I hadn’t thought of that until you me ntioned it. Hey, I think that’s the sound of a helicopter.

Bert: You’re hearing things. That’s not a helicopte r.

Irma: I think I hear search and rescue dogs. I thin k they’re onto our scent!

Bert: I think you’re starting to hallucinate. I don ’t hear anything.

Irma: Can’t you just humor me? I’m trying to keep h ope alive.

 Bert: Oh, sure. Hey, I think I hear something.

Irma: You do?

Bert: Yeah, it’s Santa Claus on his sleigh.

Our dialogue begins with Irma saying to Bert, “Do y ou really think we’ll be rescued?” “To be rescued” means to be saved from a difficult or dangerous situation. Irma says, “It’s been six hours and I’m losing hope.” “To lose hope” (hope) means to no longer believe something is poss ible. Irma doesn’t think that she and Bert will be rescued. Bert says, “It’s hard  to say,” meaning I’m not sure.

“I’m sure,” he says, “search and rescue teams are l ooking for us as we speak.” “Search and rescue (rescue) teams” are groups of pe ople that go out and try to find missing people, usually providing medical assi stance and transportation so those people can get back to “safety,” we might say .

Irma says, “But what if they don’t come in time?” “ In time” means while it is still useful – before something bad happens or before som e specific deadline. “I need to get my application in to the office in time” – b efore the deadline – “so that I’m able to apply for this job” (or whatever it is that  I’m submitting an application for). Irma is worried that the search and rescue teams wi ll not arrive in time. We’re guessing that means before Irma and Bert die from t his dangerous situation in which they find themselves.

Irma says, “We didn’t bring any provisions and we’r e almost out of water.” “Provisions” (provisions) usually refers to food th at you eat on a long journey, on a long trip. I suppose provisions could include oth er things as well, but usually it refers to food that you bring with you on a trip, e specially when you are going somewhere where there isn’t any food for you to buy  or to get easily.

Bert says, “You’re afraid of starvation and dying f rom thirst?” “Starvation” (starvation) is when you die because you don’t have  enough food. This a pretty happy dialogue, isn’t it? Yeah! We have starvation and dying of thirst. “To die of thirst” (thirst) is to die because you don’t have e nough water. “Starvation,” then, refers to not having enough food, and dying of thir st would mean to die because you don’t have any liquid, any water.

Bert says, “I think we’d die from hypothermia or ex posure to the elements first.” “Hypothermia” (hypothermia) is a medical condition of having a very low body temperature. If you’re out in the cold for a very l ong time and your body temperature begins to fall – begins to drop, begins  to go down – that could eventually kill you.

“Exposure (exposure) to the elements” refers to bei ng harmed by and possibly even dying from the conditions of the weather in a very hot, or very cold, or very wet, or very dry place when you don’t have any clot hing to protect you, or you don’t have the appropriate protection against those  “elements” or parts of the weather. So if it is a very hot area and you don’t have anywhere to go to keep you cool, you could be hurt by that. You could beco me sick or you could even die. That’s what “exposure to the elements” is refe rring to.

Irma says, “Thanks, I hadn’t thought of that until you mentioned it.” She’s not really thanking Bert. She’s telling Bert that he ha s told her something even worse than what Irma had thought of in terms of what migh t happen if the search and rescue teams don’t arrive in time.

Irma says, “Hey, I think that’s the sound of a heli copter.” A “helicopter” (helicopter) is like a plane in that it flies in the air, but unlike a plane, it can go up and down – straight up and straight down. Helicopte rs have things on top called “propellers” that go around that allow it to go up and down in the air.

Irma thinks she hears the sound of a helicopter, bu t Bert says, “You’re hearing things.” If you say “I’m hearing things” or “You’re  hearing things,” you mean that you think you hear a sound, but it’s not actually r eal. You’re hearing things that aren’t really there. If you’re a little crazy, you might hear things, and that is sometimes used almost as a joke – when someone says , “I hear something” and the other persons says, “Oh, you’re hearing things, ” meaning you’re imagining it; it’s not really true.

“That’s not a helicopter,” Bert says. But Irma says , “I think I hear search and rescue dogs.” These would be dogs that are sent out  to find someone who has gone missing. She says, “I think they’re onto our s cent.” “To be onto” something means to be aware of something, to be following it,  to be investigating it. “Scent” (scent) is a way that something or someone smells. That is, of course, how dogs find things or people that are missing. They have t he scent of that person, and then they can use their power of smell to find the person.

Bert says, “I think you’re starting to hallucinate. ” “To hallucinate” (hallucinate) means that you see or experience something that isn ’t really there. This

sometimes happens when people take certain kinds of  drugs, but it can also happen if you, for example, haven’t had enough to d rink – your mind can start to go a little crazy. Bert thinks Irma is hallucinatin g. He says, “I don’t hear anything.”

Irma says, “Can’t you just humor me?” “To humor” (h umor) someone is to go along with someone’s idea or perhaps even some joke  that someone is telling – to pretend that you agree with this person even tho ugh you don’t really agree with them or even though you don’t really think tha t his idea is something that is a good one. To humor someone would be to pretend that  you agree or pretend that whatever they are saying is true.

Irma says “Can’t you just humor me? I’m trying to k eep hope alive.” “To keep hope alive” means to continue to be positive, to co ntinue to be optimistic even when bad things are happening, even when perhaps th ere is no good reason for you to be hopeful about the future. Bert says, “Oh,  sure. Hey, I think I hear something.” Now Bert thinks he hears something. Irm a says, “You do?”

Then Burt responds, “Yeah, it’s Santa Claus on his sleigh.” He’s actually joking. He says he hears something, and when Irma asks him what, he responds “Santa Claus on his sleigh.” Santa Claus is, of course, the symbol of Christmas, and in the popular belief – at least among children – Sant a Claus delivers presents, gifts, to them every Christmas.

How does Santa Claus do this? Well he rides through  the sky, not in a helicopter – though that would seem like a good idea – but in a “sleigh” (sleigh). A “sleigh” is another word for a large “sled” (sled). What’s a  sled? A “sleigh” or a “sled” is something that moves over the snow and ice, usually  pulled by an animal such as horse or perhaps even a reindeer. Sleighs are la rge sleds that people travel in, in cold places.

It’s not something really that you see very much of  anymore. Usually it’s just done for entertainment nowadays, although there are  still, in some places of the world, people who travel by sleigh because that’s t he most efficient way of getting across snow or ice when you don’t have a he licopter.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Irma: Do you really think we’ll be rescued? It’s be en six hours and I’m losing hope.

Bert: It’s hard to say. I’m sure search and rescue teams are looking for us as we speak.
