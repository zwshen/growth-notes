This episode is a dialogue between Marcel and Fiona  about someone who is infatuated with another person. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marcel: What is this on your wall?

Fiona: It’s my tribute to Del Gordon, my favorite p layer.

Marcel: This isn’t a tribute. It’s a shrine!

Fiona: It’s not a shrine. I just have a few picture s of him taped on my wall.

Marcel: You have poster-size pictures of him coveri ng three walls of your room. This goes beyond being a fan. You’re obsessed with him.

Fiona: No, I’m not obsessed. I admit that I’m a lit tle infatuated with him, but it’s a healthy kind of adulation.

Marcel: You’ve definitely gotten carried away.

Fiona: Just a little. I’m devoted to watching him p lay in every game and I try to find out as much as I can about him, but it’s becau se I admire him. It’s not like I’m stalking him or something.

Marcel: Then why do you have all of this equipment?

Fiona: That’s in case there’s a sighting of him in this city.

 Marcel: A sighting?

Fiona: Yes, there’s a network of fans that keeps ta bs on him, and if I learn that he’s in town, I can try to get a photo with him.

Marcel: And what are those handcuffs for?

Fiona: I only have those in case he doesn’t coopera te.

Marcel: You’re right. Your infatuation is completel y healthy!

Marcel begins our dialogue by asking Fiona, “What i s this on your wall?” Fiona has something hanging on her wall, something attach ed to her wall. Fiona says, “It’s my tribute to Del Gordon, my favorite player.  Del Gordon appears to be an athlete of some sort. Fiona says it’s her “tribute to Del Gordon.” A “tribute” is something that you do or say that shows that you ho nor and respect another person. It could be a speech that you give to a gro up of people. It could be a party that you have in honor of this person. In the  case of Fiona, it’s something that she has on her wall.

Marcel says, “This isn’t a tribute. It’s a shrine!”  A “shrine” (shrine) is normally considered a holy place, a place of prayer where pe ople worship God. So, to call this a “shrine” means that it is more than just a s imple little photograph or tribute of some sort – it is instead something bigger, some thing that it looks like it could be a shrine. People do sometimes have small shrines  in their homes for religious reasons, but this is not something religious; this is what we might call an “infatuation,” which I’ll define in a minute.

Fiona says, “It’s not a shrine. I just have a few p ictures of him taped on my wall.” They’re attached to her wall – probably not by tape , although they might be. Marcel says, “You have poster-size pictures of him covering three walls of your room.” A “poster” (poster) is a large piece of pape r, typically, that is used to advertise a movie or perhaps a rock band or even a sports star. People often have posters – especially young people – in their r ooms of their favorite athlete or musician or actor.

Posters can be quite large – usually two- or three- feet tall – and that’s what Marcel is referring to when he says that Fiona has “poster-size pictures,” meaning the photographs are as big as posters. “Thi s goes beyond being a fan,”

Marcel says, “You’re obsessed with him.” A “fan” (f an) is someone who likes an athlete, musician, actor, or perhaps a type of spor t or a type of music or even a podcast. (Why not?)

Marcel says that Fiona is obsessed with Del Gordon.  “To be obsessed” (obsessed) means that you are only able to think ab out one thing. The adjective is “obsessive.” Someone who is obsessive is always thinking about one thing. Sometimes this can be an indication of some sort of  mental illness. Here, it refers to Fiona’s love of this particular athlete. She’s o bsessed with this athlete. She can’t think of anything else.

Fiona says, “No, I’m not obsessed.” She disagrees w ith Marcel. She says, “I admit that I’m a little infatuated with him, but it ’s a healthy kind of adulation.” She says “I admit,” meaning I will confess or I will say something that is true, even though it isn’t something I may be proud of. She sa ys she’s a little “infatuated” with Gordon. “To be infatuated (infatuated) with” s omeone is to basically be in love with this person, but usually only for a short  time.

When you are attracted to, for example, a beautiful  woman or a handsome man, you might become infatuated with that person. You m ay think of nothing but that person and think that perhaps you are even in love with that person, even if you’ve only seen them on the street. That happens t o everyone, I suppose (not after you get married, though).

Fiona is infatuated with Del Gordon, but she says “ it’s a healthy kind of “adulation.” “Adulation” (adulation) is showing a l ot of love and admiration for someone or for something, usually to an extreme ext ent. You’re doing it too much. Marcel says, “You’ve definitely gotten carrie d away.” “To get carried away” means to do too much of something, anything.

You could get carried away with exercising. You cou ld go to the gym four hours every day – unless you’re a professional athlete, t hat’s probably getting carried away. That’s what has happened to Fiona. She’s gott en carried away with her love of Del Gordon, her favorite player. Fiona says , “Just a little,” meaning she’s only gotten a little carried away.

“I’m devoted to watching him play in every game, an d I try to find out as much as I can about him, but it’s because I admire him.” Fi ona says she’s “devoted” (devoted). “To be devoted to” something means that you are strongly committed to this person or this thing, almost with feelings of love for whatever the activity is. The activity here is watching Del Gordon play i n every game. That’s what Fiona is devoted to.

 She says that she “admires” him. “To admire” (admir e) is to think that someone or something is very good and deserves a lot of res pect. You can admire a person without being in love with them, of course, or even being infatuated with them. You can admire a politician, although I’m not  sure why you would, but you could. You could admire a leader of a company or a religious group. Lots of possibilities. Therefore, “admiration,” which is the noun that comes from the verb “to admire.”

Next Fiona says, “It’s not like I’m stalking him or  something.” “It’s not like” means this is not what I am doing. I am not stalking him.  “To stalk” (stalk) someone is to follow someone in a secret, hidden way that is usua lly considered dangerous. Perhaps you want to hurt the person. Perhaps you ev en want to kill the person.

We have stalkers of celebrities here in Los Angeles  – people who follow celebrities, famous people, around. This is, depend ing on how you do it, potentially illegal, and you could get arrested for  following someone around, especially if it seems as though you might do somet hing hurtful or damaging to that person. But Fiona says she’s not stalking Del Gordon. Marcel says, “Then why do you have all of this equipment?” We’re not s ure what equipment Marcel is referring to.

Fiona says, “That’s in case there is a sighting of him in this city.” “In case” means if something happens, in this particular situation.  A “sighting” (sighting) is when you see someone or something, often something that is very rare. Here in L.A., people talk about “star sightings” – seeing famous celebrities, famous people. Have I seen famous people here in Los Angeles? Sure . You see them at the grocery store. You see them at the mall. You see th em on the street. If you live in the city of Los Angeles, you’re going to see some f amous people eventually.

Marcel then asks, “A sighting?” Fiona says, “Yes, t here’s a network of fans that keeps tabs on him, and if I learn that he is in tow n, I can try to get a photo with him.” A “network” is a group of people who are all connected in some way and who are communicating with each other. A “network” can also refer to a group of computers that are connected to each other for some  common purpose. The phrase “to keep tabs (tabs) on” someone means to kn ow the location of someone – to know where someone is or what they are doing.

Fiona says there are people in this network of fans  who keep tabs on Del Gordon. If Fiona learns that her favorite athlete i s “in town,” meaning in the city right now, she can try to get a photo with him. Not ice we say “in town” when someone is physically present in the city where you  are. The opposite would be

“out of town.” If you are “out of town,” you are no t in the city where you are normally – the place where you live, say.

Marcel says, “And what are those handcuffs for?” “H andcuffs” (handcuffs) are two metal rings that go around your wrists. The rin gs are attached by a short chain. Police use handcuffs in order to arrest some one, to make sure the person doesn’t try to escape. Fiona has a pair of handcuff s. Why? She says, “I only have those in case he doesn’t cooperate.”

In other words, she has these handcuffs in case she  sees her favorite player and asks the favorite player for a photograph and the p layer says no. If that happens, then she can put handcuffs around him and make him take a photograph with her. Of course, this is not something you can do. I t’s illegal to do that sort of thing. And it’s also a sign that Fiona really is ob sessed with this person.

Marcel says sarcastically – jokingly – “You’re righ t. Your infatuation is completely healthy,” meaning there’s nothing wrong with this i nfatuation with this person. He means, of course, just the opposite. You can tell b y the way he says it that he’s being sarcastic. He’s joking. “Sarcasm” means sayin g one thing but meaning another in order to make a joke.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed
