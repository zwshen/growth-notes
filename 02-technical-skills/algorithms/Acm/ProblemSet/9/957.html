<P>
On the occasion of Pope John Paul II death, the American weekly 
magazine Time observed the largest number of Popes to be selected in a 100-year 
period was 28, from 867 (Adrian II) to 965 (John XIII). This is a very interesting 
piece of trivia, but it would be much better to have a program to compute that 
number for a period of any length, not necessarily 100 years. Furthermore, the 
Catholic Church being an eternal institution, as far as we can predict it, we 
want to make sure that our program will remain valid per omnia secula 
seculorum.

<P>
Write a program that given the list of years in which each Pope was elected and 
a positive number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>, computes the largest number of Popes that were in 
office in a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>-year period, and the year of election for the first and last Popes in 
that period. Note that, given a year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>-year period that starts in 
year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> is the time interval from the first day of year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> to the last day of year <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> + <I>Y</I> - 1</SPAN>.
In case of a tie, i.e., if there is more that one <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>-year period with 
the same largest number of Popes, your program should report only the most ancient one.

<B>The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.
Consecutive test cases are separated by a single blank line.

The first line of the input contains a positive integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>, the 
number of years of the period we are interested in. The second line contains 
another positive integer, the number of Popes, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN>. Each of the remaining <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> lines 
contains the year of election of a Pope, in chronological order. We know that <!-- MATH

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I><IMG

<P>
For each test case, write to the output contains a single line with three integers, separated by spaces: the largest number of Popes in a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>-year period, the year of election of the first Pope in 
that period and the year of election of the last Pope in the period.
