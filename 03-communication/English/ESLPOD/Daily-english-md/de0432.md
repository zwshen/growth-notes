This episode is called “Using the Copier.”  The “copier,”  or the “photocopier,” is a machine that we use to make copies of pieces of paper – t he things that are on the paper.  We have a dialogue between Tim and Pam a bout some common problems – some common vocabulary you may encounter (you may h ear) when talking about the copy machine.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tim:  Damn it!

Pam:  What’s the matter?

Tim:  It’s this copier.  My original didn’t come out of the feeder and there’s a paper jam.

Pam:  Let me see if I can clear it.  This machine is rea lly temperamental.

Tim:  Tell me about it.

Pam:  Okay, I found your original, but it’s stuck.  I’m a fraid if I pull too hard, it’ll tear.

Tim:  Let me try.  I got it!  Okay, I need to shrink the first page and adjust the contrast so that it’s more readable.  Then I need to en large the second page. After that, I need to make 20 collated copies.

Pam:  Oh, oh, don’t look now, but the toner light is on.  You’ll need to put in a new cartridge.

 Tim:  Is there anything else that can go wrong with thi s stupid copier?!

Pam:  Don’t tempt fate.  It could be worse.  The whol e thing could break down!

[end of dialogue]

Tim begins our dialogue by “swearing,” by saying a not very nice word.  He says, “Damn it!”  “Damn it” is an expression that you use when you’re angry at something or someone.  It’s not something you would want  to say in front of children or your boss, for example.  Sometimes people simp ly say “damn.”  If they want to say something that is not a swear word (not a bad word), they may say something like “darn it” or “darn,” although that ca n seem a little old- fashioned to some people nowadays.

Tim says, “Damn it!” and Pam asks, “What’s the matter?” me aning what’s the problem.  Tim says, “It’s this copier.”  The “copier” is t he photocopy machine, what in many offices people call the “copy machine.”  Tim  says, “My original didn’t come out of the feeder and there’s a paper jam .”  The “original” would be the document or other piece of paper that you are tryin g to make a copy of.  The “feeder” (feeder) is the part of the copy machine where  you put your paper into, the paper that you want to copy.  For example, if you ha ve 10 pages, you would put those 10 pages, all at once, into a feeder and the  copy machine will take one page at a time and copy it.  At least, most copy machines h ave feeders; not all of them do.  A “jam” (jam) in this dialogue means a situ ation where a machine stops working because something inside of it is in the wrong po sition or the wrong place.  We especially use this expression when we are talking  about something that you put into a machine, for example, you’re puttin g paper into the copy machine and if the paper doesn’t go through correctly – if it gets “stuck,” we could say – if it stops moving inside the machine when it should continue to move, we will say that there is a jam – a paper jam.  If you wo rk with copy machines, you know this is a common problem, especially when they get very  warm.

Pam says, “Let me see if I can clear it.”  To “clear” some thing means, in this case, to fix the jam, to take out the thing that has cause d the problem.  Pam says, “This machine is really temperamental.”  The word “t emperamental” means something that only works some of the time, something th at is difficult to operate correctly.  It can also be used to describe someone who i s perhaps a little unstable, someone who changes their mood very quickly.  We might describe that person as being temperamental.

 Tim says, “Tell me about it.”  After Pam says machine is r eally temperamental, Tim uses an expression that shows that he agrees with Pam.  It’s often something that you will say, this expression “tell me about  it,” when it’s a negative thing and that you already know about it and you have a  lot of, perhaps, experience with it.

Pam says, “Okay, I found your original, but it’s stuck.”  We  mentioned earlier that a paper jam is when paper gets stuck.  “Stuck” means unab le to move, something that is trapped in one place or position.  So metimes we use this expression when we’re trying to figure out a complicated  problem.  For example, a student is doing a math problem, let’s say an algebra  problem, and he starts to solve the problem but after a few minutes he doesn’t kno w what to do.  He might say, “I’m stuck” – I can’t move forward, I don’t know the a nswer.  Here, the term refers to the paper that can’t move because it’s inside  the machine.  Pam says, “I’m afraid if I pull too hard, (the original – the  paper) will tear (tear).”  “Tear” means to be ripped into two or more pieces.  This is a ve rb we use, for example, when you have a piece of paper and you do this [sound of paper being torn].  If you rip or tear the paper, the paper will now be in two different pieces.  The word “tear,” like the word “feeder” that we mentioned ear lier, has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Tim says, “Let me try,” meaning let me try to get the pa per out of the machine. He then says, “I got it!”  He was able to remove it.  “ Okay, I need to shrink the first page and adjust the contrast so that it is more rea dable.”  To “shrink” means to make something smaller, to reduce the size.  To “adjust  the contrast” means to change the difference between two things, usually someth ing that is white and black or light and dark.  So, if you have a piece of pa per where the writing isn’t very clear, you may increase the contrast so that the cop ier is able to copy more effectively.  So, “contrast” is a difference between two  things; when we’re talking about a copy machine, it refers to the black and the wh ite on the page.  Tim says, “Then I need to enlarge the second page.”  To “enlarg e” is the opposite of to reduce or to shrink; to “enlarge” means to make larger,  to make something bigger.  “After that,” Tim says, “I need to make 20 col lated copies.”  Something that is “collated” is something that is put into the corr ect order.  So, if you have three pages that you are copying, and you need to make 1 0 copies for a meeting you’re going to, “collated copies” would be copies wher e the pages (one, two, and three) are in the correct order.  Not 10 pages wit h page one, 10 pages with page two, 10 pages with page three; that would be un -collated.

 Tim says that he needs 20 collated copies, but Pam says, “Oh,  oh, don’t look now.”  “Oh, oh” is when something wrong happens – some thing bad happens, and you are indicating that.  The expression “don’t look now” is a phrase used to tell someone that there’s a problem that you know will  make him or her angry or upset.  Pam says, “don’t look now, but the toner light is on.”  The “toner” (toner) is the “ink,” the black stuff or the colored stuff that is use d in printers, fax machines, and copiers.  Usually you can only get so many copies from one  cartridge of toner.  A “cartridge” is the package, the small, often plastic box where the ink (the toner) is kept.  So, if your toner “runs out” (if there ’s no more), you’ll have to put in a new toner cartridge.

Tim says, “Is there anything else that can go wrong with t his stupid copier?!” Notice Tim says the “stupid copier,” we often say that ab out a thing when we are frustrated with it.  Of course, the copier isn’t stupid; it isn’t anything at all, it’s not human.  Maybe Tim’s the stupid one here!

Pam says, “Don’t tempt fate.”  The expression “to tempt f ate” means to take a risk or do something knowing that something bad may happ en.  Pam says, “It could be worse (the situation could be worse).  The whol e thing (the entire copy machine) could break down!”  To “break down” is a two-w ord phrasal verb for a machine or a car to stop working, something that stops wor king and needs to be fixed.  We use this verb in talking about a car: “My car br oke down,” meaning something bad happened, something went wrong and the car needs to be fixed.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
