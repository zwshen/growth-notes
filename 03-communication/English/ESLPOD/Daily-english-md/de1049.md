This episode is a dialogue between David and Susie about buying tickets to see a play at a theater. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Susie: I can’t believe I’m going to get to see my f avorite actor in a play. I want front row seats!

David: I’m looking at the venue’s seating plan righ t now, and all front row seats are taken for the entire run. I’m guessing that sea son ticket holders got those.

Susie: Damn! All right. Let’s try to get seats as c lose to the stage as possible, preferably in the orchestra.

David: The only orchestra tickets still available h ave partially obstructed views.

Susie: Okay, we’ll take those.

David: But we won’t be able to see the entire stage . These tickets in the loge or mezzanine, or even the balcony, will give us a bett er view of the play.

Susie: I don’t need to see every part of the play. I just want to get as close to him as possible.

David: Wait one second. I see two seats in the seco nd row still available for the matinee performance. Oh no, those are seats for whe elchair access.

Susie: That’s great! We’ll take those.

 David: But neither of us needs wheelchair access.

Susie: I’ll break a leg if I have to, to get that c lose to him.

David: Do the words “obsessed fan” mean anything to  you?

Susie: You can call it obsession, but I call it dev otion!

Susie begins our dialogue by saying to David, “I ca n’t believe I’m going to get to see my favorite actor in a play.” A “play” is a the atrical performance, a dramatic performance usually done on what is called a “stage ” inside of something called a “theater.” “Play” as a noun refers to the perform ance, but it can also refer to the actual words of the performance. We talk about Shak espeare’s plays, like Macbeth  and Julius Caesar . These are dramatic pieces of literature that Shakespeare wrote and that are now performed as pla ys.

Here, Susie is using “play” in the sense of the per formance – the actual acting out of the play, if you will. Susie says, “I want f ront row seats.” The chairs of the places where you sit – the seats in a theater – are  arranged in lines, often curved lines called “rows.” Each row has a certain number of seats, a certain number of places where people can sit. The “front row” would be the row that is closest to the “stage” – the area where the play is being perf ormed.

David says, “I’m looking at the venue’s seating pla n right now and all front row seats are taken for the entire run.” A “venue” (ven ue) is just another word for the place where something is performed, such as a play or concert. The “seating plan” is a picture that shows the different rows in  the theater. Nowadays, when you buy your tickets online over the Internet to se e a play or concert, you can look and see which seats are available on the seati ng plan. The seating plan for this play shows all front row seats taken.

When we say the seats are “taken,” we mean they’re not available; someone else has already bought them. “The front row seats are taken for the entire run,” David says. The “run” (run) of a play is the period  of time that the play is being performed. Most plays are performed for a few weeks , sometimes for months and months. It depends on the play and where it is being performed. There are plays on Broadway; the street in New York that has large theaters where you can see theatrical performances has plays that have bee n running for years. So, it just depends on the play and how popular it is.

 David says, “I’m guessing that season ticket holder s got those.” “Season ticket holders” are people who buy tickets for all of the different plays being performed either at a specific theater or, more typically, by  a theater company – a group of actors that puts on plays. You could also be a seas on ticket holder for a professional baseball team or for a college footbal l team. That means you would have tickets for all of the games during the time w hen games are being played during the season.

For example, baseball season is from April to Octob er. If you had season tickets, you would have tickets for all of the games during that period of time in a given year. I used to have season tickets for one of the theater groups here in Los Angeles. That was many years ago, I’m afraid. David  says the season ticket holders probably got the front row seats. They get the first opportunity to buy seats.

Susie is not happy. She even swears, she’s so unhap py. She says, “Damn!” (damn) “All right. Let’s try to get seats as close to the stage as possible, preferably in the orchestra.” The “stage” is the pl ace where the play is performed. It’s usually a raised floor that’s somewhat above t he people who are watching the play, so everyone can see it easily.

In some theaters, right next to the stage there’s a  place for an orchestra – a group of musicians – to play music. However, many t heaters have what’s called an “orchestra section,” where there are seats that you can purchase that are also close to the stage in the very front section of the  theater. That’s where Susie wants to get tickets. David says, however, “The onl y orchestra tickets still available have partially obstructed views.”

If your view is “obstructed” (obstructed), it is bl ocked. You can’t actually see it. “Partially” means partly, not completely. So, seats  that have a partially obstructed view are seats from which you can see the stage, bu t there might be something blocking your view. There might be a pole or there might be, I don’t know, part of a wall that is blocking your view. Often in large t heaters there are what are called “pillars” (pillars) that are used to support the ro of, to hold the roof up, but if the seat is behind the pillar or next to the pillar, it  may obstruct or block your view.

Susie says, “Well, we’ll take those” – we’ll take t he partially obstructed view seats. David says, “But we won’t be able to see the  entire stage.” “Entire” here means the whole thing, completely. He then says, “T hese tickets,” referring to a different set of tickets, “in the loge or mezzanine , or even the balcony, will give us a better view of the play.” Theaters are divided in to different sections. We talked

about the “orchestra section,” which would be right  next to the stage. The “loge” (loge) section of a theater is located in the front  of the balcony in a theater.

A “balcony” (balcony) is a second level in the thea ter. You have seats on the ground floor, the first floor of the theater, and t hen you may have some seats on a second level. That second level is called the “ba lcony.” The “loge,” then, is the front section of the balcony. The word “mezzanine” (mezzanine) usually refers to the middle of something. “Mezzanine,” in the theate r, would be the section in a balcony where there is more than one balcony.

So, if you have two balconies, which would be three  total levels of seats, the middle or lowest balcony would be the “mezzanine le vel.” Sometimes you’ll see that word “mezzanine” refer to a level in a buildin g that’s in between, say, the ground floor and the floor above it. It’s actually a floor in between two other floors that are numbered either 1 and 2, or 0 and 1. Here it refers to a balcony in the theater – the lowest balcony.

Notice, however, that David talks about the balcony  seats. Mezzanine seats are in the balcony, in a balcony. But when we talk abou t balcony seats, especially if the theater is a big one and it has more than one b alcony, you often are referring to the upper levels, the upper balconies, not the l ower one, not the mezzanine. It’s a little confusing because they’re all called “balconies,” but in this case it means seats that are above the mezzanine level, on a balcony above the mezzanine.

Susie then says, “I don’t need to see every part of  the play. I just want to get as close to him as possible.” We were talking about ob structed views, but Susie says something here a little confusing. She says, “ I don’t need to see every part of the play.” Normally when we talk about a part of  the play, we’re talking about a section of it, not seeing just part of the stage. P erhaps that’s what she means here. She says she just wants to get as close to he r favorite actor as possible. David says, “Wait one second,” meaning stop talking ; wait for me to do something or tell you something.

Then he says, “I see two seats in the second row st ill available for the matinee performance.” The “second row” would be the row beh ind the front row. A “matinee (matinee) performance” is a performance du ring the day. Typically, plays are performed at night, but sometimes they pe rform them during the day, say at two o’clock in the afternoon. That would be a matinee performance. You can also talk about a “matinee movie,” a movie that  is shown in a movie theater in the afternoon in addition to the evening.

David has found a couple of seats, but then he real izes there’s a problem. He says, “Oh no, those seats are for wheelchair access .” A “wheelchair” is a seat with round wheels on them (I guess most wheels woul d be round, right?) that allow the person in the chair to move back and forw ard. Wheelchairs are for those who are not able to walk, or walk very easily . “Wheelchair access” refers to a place where wheelchairs can be put in a theater, in this case, in order to watch the play.

Susie says, “That’s a great! We’ll take those.” She  wants David to buy these wheelchair access seats. David says, “But neither of us needs wheelchair access.” Susie responds, “I’ll break a leg if I hav e to, to get that close to him.” Susie says she’s going to go out and break her leg in order to get a wheelchair so she can sit in the seats. David says, “Do the wo rds ‘obsessed fan’ mean anything to you?”

A “fan” (fan) is someone who enjoys a particular ki nd of entertainment or a particular person. “Obsessed” (obsessed) is when yo u are only able to think about one thing. You can’t think about anything els e. An “obsessed fan” would be a fan who will do anything to get close to the pers on or the object of which he or she is a fan, I guess. The expression “Do the words  (blank) mean anything to you?” is sort of a funny way of saying that you are  this thing – you are whatever I have described.

So, in this case, David is saying that Susie is an obsessed fan. Susie says, “You can call it obsession, but I call it devotion!” “De votion” (devotion) is love or loyalty towards someone, something, or to God. We can talk about devotion in a religious sense. Susie is devoted to her favorite a ctor – hopelessly devoted to him, you might say.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
