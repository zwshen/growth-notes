This episode is a dialogue between Paul and Jackie,  and it’s going to be talking about people at work who don’t do what they are sup posed to do.  Sound familiar?  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paul:  What time is it?

Jackie:  It’s 2:30.  The Cleveland office report sh ould have been emailed to us by the end of the workday yesterday.  What are we supp osed to do now?

Paul:  If we don’t get their report, we’ll have to hold up the production of the annual report and if that happens, somebody’s head is going to roll.  This really leaves us in a lurch.  Who’s responsible for the re port in Cleveland?

Jackie:  Noel Simmons.

Paul:  Oh, no.  I know Noel.  I used to work with h im in the Columbus office.  He was always dropping the ball on his responsibilitie s and I was always having to cover for him.

Jackie:  You must have had the patience of a saint!   If he’s such a flake, why is he still working for this company?

Paul:  Beats me, but I know we’re in for a long wai t if he’s in charge.  We have to do something.  Get on the phone and see if you can light a fire under him. Unless we keep on him, we’ll never see that report.

Jackie:  Okay, I’ll call the Cleveland office right  now.

Paul:  And Jackie?

Jackie:  Yes?

Paul:  If he gives you a line or some kind of excus e, let me talk to him.

Jackie:  What’ll you do?

Paul:  I’ll take him on a trip down memory lane.  W hen I used to work with him, I wasn’t always so patient – or polite.

We’re in a business office in this dialogue.  Paul asks Jackie what time it is. Jackie says, “It’s 2:30,” 2:30 in the afternoon.  S he says, “The Cleveland office report should have been emailed to us by the end of  the workday yesterday.” Cleveland is a city in the State of Ohio, which is in the eastern central part of the United States.  Jackie says that office – the Cleve land office should have emailed them a report, “What are we supposed to do now?”  W hat can we do now?  What should we do now?

Paul says, “If we don’t get their report, we’ll hav e to hold up the production of the annual report.”  “To hold up” here means to delay, to make something happen later than you originally planned because there has  been some problem.  In this case, the problem is that the other office didn’t f inish their “report,” their set of papers they were supposed to prepare about somethin g, we don’t know what. “To hold up” here, then, means to delay the “produc tion,” or the making of the annual report.  “Hold up” has other meanings, very different meanings, in English.  You can find some of those in our Learning Guide.  An “annual report” is a report that a large company produces, especial ly what we would call a “public company,” a publicly traded company, a comp any that people can buy stock in – partial ownership in.  They’re required to produce an annual report that says what they did the past year: what business the y did, what new projects they have, and so forth.  “Annual” means every year.  Pa ul says, “if that happens, somebody’s head is going to roll.”  The expression “heads will roll” or “someone’s head is going to roll” (roll) means someone will be  punished for this; someone is going to get into trouble for this, perhaps even fi red from their job – lose their job. The expression comes from when you kill people by c utting off their heads.  And, of course, after you cut off the head it would fall  down on the ground and “roll,” turn around kind of like a ball – kind of like a so ccer ball, always reminds me a little bit of that.  Anyway, Paul says, “This reall y leaves us in a lurch.”  “To be left in a lurch” (lurch) means that you have a big probl em, a very difficult situation.

“He left me in a lurch,” he left me with a very dif ficult situation.  Paul says, “Who’s responsible for the report in Cleveland?”  Who is the person who is supposed to be writing this report?  Jackie says, “Noel Simmons .”  Paul says, “Oh, no.  I know Noel (I know this person).  I used to work with him  in the Columbus office.” Columbus is another city in Ohio.  There are three cities in Ohio that begin with “C” – at least three: Columbus, Cleveland, and Cinc innati.

Well, Paul used to work with Noel in the Columbus o ffice.  He says Noel “was always dropping the ball on his responsibilities.”  The expression “to drop the ball” means not to do what you are supposed to do, to be unreliable.  The title of this episode is “Working With Unreliable People,” n ot reliable.  “Reliable” means you can trust them, you can trust them to do what they are supposed to do.  Well, Noel is unreliable; he’s always dropping the ball.  Paul says, “I was always having to cover for him.”  “To cover for (someone)”  means to do something so that other people don’t know that this person has m ade a mistake.  You are, perhaps, lying or doing something so that no one el se discovers what your friend or your coworker did wrong.  You’re helping them th at way – at least you think you are.

Jackie says, “You must have had the patience of a s aint!”  “To be patient” means to be able to wait, to tolerate or put up with diff icult situations without getting angry or without losing your temper.  A “saint” is a holy person; someone, here, who represents a perfect person; someone who is ver y holy, someone who is very, very good.  Jackie says, “You must have had the patience of a saint!”  It’s an expression.  She says, “If he’s such a flake, wh y is he still working for this company?”  A “flake” (flake) is an unreliable perso n, someone who doesn’t do what they’re supposed to do.  The State of Californ ia, the City of Los Angeles especially, is full of flakes, people who say they’ re going to do something but don’t.  At least, that’s the reputation that the ci ty and state have with some people.  Jackie wants to know why Noel, if he’s suc h a flake, is still working at the company.  Why didn’t he get fired?

Paul says, “Beats me.”  “Beats me” is an informal w ay of saying I don’t know, I don’t know the answer to that question.  He says, “ Beats me, but I know we’re in for a long wait if he’s in charge.”  “To be in for”  means to be expecting or deserving to have something done.  “We’re in for a cold winter this year,” meaning we can expect a cold winter.  In this case,  Paul says they’re in for a long wait if he, Noel, is in charge.  “To be in charge” means to be responsible for some project or some group; you’re the person who is the boss of that project: you make the decisions, and so forth.  Paul says, “ We have to do something. Get on the phone (call on the telephone) and see if  you can light a fire under him.”  The expression “to light a fire under (someo ne)” means to do or say

something to get that person to work, to do somethi ng, especially if the person is lazy or unreliable.  Usually it means applying some  sort of pressure, doing something to push the person to get their job done.   If you light a fire you will create heat, of course, and that will cause a perso n to get up and move if you actually lit a fire under someone.  Well, that’s wh at you’re trying to do here.  Paul says, “Unless we keep on him (keep on Noel), we’ll never see that report.”  “To keep on (someone)” means to bother them repeatedly until they do what you want them to do.  Another word for this would be “t o nag” (nag).  “Stop nagging me.”  This is something husbands occasionally – not  this husband – says about their wives.  “My wife is always nagging me to do s omething,” always telling me to do something until I actually do it.  Well, that ’s what Paul says they have to do with Noel.

Jackie says, “Okay, I’ll call the Cleveland office right now.”  Paul says, “And Jackie?”  Jackie says, “Yes?”  Actually, probably s ays something like “Yes?” Paul says, “If he gives you a line or some kind of excuse, let me talk to him.” When you say you’re “giving someone a line” (line) you mean you’re giving them an excuse, something that other people might say as  an excuse.  “Oh, I got busy,” or “Oh, my cat died and I had to go home and  bury it,” put it in the ground, give it a funeral, and so forth.  These are excuses , and many people try to give excuses when they don’t do what they’re supposed to  do.  So Paul says, “If he gives you a line (an excuse), let me talk to him.”

Jackie says, “What’ll you do?”  What will you do?  Paul says, “I’ll take him on a trip down memory lane.”  A “lane” (lane) is like a small road.  But the expression “to take a trip down memory lane” means to spend so me time remembering things that have happened in the past.  Normally, the expression means you’re taking a pleasant trip, if you will, you’re remembe ring good things that happened in the past.  But in this case, Paul is making some thing of a joke.  He’s going to remind Noel of bad things that happened in the past .  He says, “When I used to work with him, I wasn’t always so patient – or poli te.”  “To be polite” (polite) means to be kind, to be nice.  It’s the opposite of  “rude” (rude), which means to be mean, not to be nice.  Paul is saying that he’s going to treat Noel the way he used to treat him in the past.  That is, he’s proba bly going to get angry with him.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
