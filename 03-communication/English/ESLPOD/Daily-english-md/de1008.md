This episode is a dialogue between Susanna and Clar k about someone who’s trying to do something illegal with money. Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Susanna: What’s going on in the office next door? I  heard that the police shut down their business.

Clark: You heard right. The cops had long suspected  that the business operating out of that office wasn’t legit.

Susanna: Not legit?

Clark: Yeah, it was a front for money laundering. T he so-called services it offered were a sham. It was a way for people to send them d irty money and for the business to legitimize those funds.

Susanna: But who was involved?

Clark: I’m not sure, but I imagine they’re people w ho want to evade taxes or to circumvent certain laws or regulations. I wouldn’t be surprised if their clients were people with underworld connections.

Susanna: You mean organized crime?

Clark: Yeah, they’re probably drug lords, smugglers , and racketeers.

Susanna: Wow, and the people who helped them were w orking next door to us all that time.

Clark: And we didn’t know a thing about it. How awf ul.

Susanna: How exciting!

Our dialogue begins with Susanna saying to Clark, “ What’s going on in the office next door?” The “office next door” would be the off ice that is right next to your office. We could also talk about the “house next do or” – literally, the next door that you would open if you went over a little bit f rom where you are now. We talk about our “next door neighbor” as the person or the  house that is immediately next to ours. Here, we’re talking about an “office next door.”

Susanna says, “I heard that the police shut down th eir business.” Clark says, “You’re right. The cops had long suspected that the  business operating out of that office wasn’t legit.” Clark says the police “s uspected.” “To suspect” (suspect) is to think that something is true, especially when  we’re talking about someone doing something wrong or committing a crime, althou gh it could be a situation that is not criminal.

You could say, “I suspect that my brother is not ve ry happy living in Minnesota.” I’m not sure. I don’t have proof of that. I don’t h ave a lot of “evidence,” we would say, of that, but I think it’s true. When the polic e suspect someone of something, usually they think that person has done something w rong, has done something against the law.

The “cops,” which is an informal term for the polic e, had “long suspected,” meaning they had suspected for a long time, “that the business operating out of that office was not legit.” “Legit” (legit) is shor t for “legitimate” (legitimate). Something that is legitimate is something that is r eal, something that is valid – in this case, something that is legal. The business wa s doing things that weren’t legal.

Susanna says, “Not legit?” Clark says, “Yeah, it wa s a front for money laundering.” A “front” (front) is a business or org anization that doesn’t do what it says it does. It is established or created or start ed in order to hide some sort of illegal activity. So, you might have someone who op ens up a store, but the store isn’t really for selling food or selling clothing –  whatever the store sells. The store

is really there in order to do something else, some thing illegal. One thing that is illegal is “money laundering.”

“To launder” (launder) means to clean your clothes.  We talk about taking your clothes to a “laundromat,” which is a place that ha s washing machines and drying machines – or, simply, “dryers.” “Money laundering”  is when you take money that you got from doing something illegal and use it in a business that is legal so that the police won’t know where the money really came f rom. It looks like it came from this business, even though it was gotten from some sort of illegal activity.

For example, you may be selling drugs illegally and  making a lot of money selling these drugs. You don’t want the police to find out about where you got all this money, and you want to put the money in a bank or d o something with the money. So, you start a business that sells clothing . You invest the money that you got selling drugs into the clothing store, and then the clothing store makes money, and now suddenly the money has been laundere d.

You can say, “Well, the money came from my clothing  store,” and it looks “clean” – it looks like it came from a legal operation, whe n in fact it came from you selling drugs. That would be an example of money laundering . Clark says, “The so- called services it offered were a sham.” The expres sions “so-called” (called) means presumably. It’s a phrase we use to refer to something that isn’t really true, or where you have a name for something that i sn’t really accurate. So, in this case, the business was selling services, but they weren’t really services, and so Clark uses the term “so-called.”

For example, you could talk about giving money to a  government official in order to get the government official to do something for you. This is illegal. You could call it a gift, however. Someone would then refer to that gift as your “so-called gift,” because it isn’t really a gift. It is, in fa ct, what we would call a “bribe” (bribe) – when you give money to a government official to d o something for you. In most countries, bribes are illegal, which does not mean they’re not common.

The business here offered certain services that wer en’t really services at all. These services are what Clark calls a “sham” (sham) . Something that is a sham is something that is fake, something that is false,  something that is not what it appears to be. Clark says, “It was a way for people  to send them dirty money and for the business to legitimize those funds.” “Dirty  money” would be money that you obtained or got from doing something illegal. “ To legitimize (legitimize) is to make legitimate – to make it seem as though in this  case it were legal.

Susanna asks, “But who was involved?” Clark says, “ I’m not sure, but I imagine” – I’m guessing – “they’re people who want to evade taxes or to circumvent certain laws or regulations.” “To evade” (evade) is  to avoid something. “To evade taxes” is to avoid paying money to the government that you have to pay them.

If you work in the United States, for example, you have to pay taxes to the U.S. government, a certain percentage of your money to the government, so the government has money to waste on other things, No, I’m just joking. The government needs money. It just doesn’t always spen d the money very wisely, but back to our story . . .

Clark says that this front was used by people who wanted to evade taxes or to “circumvent certain laws or regulations.” “To circu mvent” (circumvent) means to go around something, but here it really means the s ame as “to evade.” It means to avoid doing something. Clark says, “I wouldn’t b e surprised if their clients were people with underworld connections.” The term “unde rworld” (underworld) refers to the world of criminals, the world of the illegal  activities by criminals.

Susanna says, “You mean organized crime?” “Organize d crime” refers to groups of criminals who organize, who have an organization  that is used to commit crimes. You may have organized crime involved in se lling drugs. There isn’t just one person who goes and finds drugs and sells them to another person. It’s usually part of an organization, and these organiza tions, as you probably know, can be very dangerous and very powerful.

Clark says, “Yeah, they’re probably drug lords, smu gglers and racketeers.” The term “drug lord” refers to a very powerful person w ho is involved in this organization, in organized crime, selling drugs. A “smuggler” (smuggler) is a person who brings things into a country illegally, against the law. If you are smuggling in drugs to the United States, you are br inging these illegal drugs in here without permission.

A “racketeer” (racketeer) is a person who is involv ed in illegal business activities, often involving some sort of violent crime. The ter m “racketeer” is used in a very broad way to refer to people who are doing things i llegal in terms of running a business. Susanna says, “Wow, and the people who he lped them were working next door to us all that time.” She is amazed that the people that were working in the office next door were part of this illegal acti vity.

Clark says, “And we didn’t know a thing about it. H ow awful.” When we say something is “awful” (awful) nowadays, we mean it’s  terrible. It’s horrible. It’s very

unpleasant. Clark thinks this entire situation is a wful. Susanna says, however, “How exciting!” She thinks that it’s exciting rathe r than awful.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
