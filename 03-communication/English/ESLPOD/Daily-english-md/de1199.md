This episode is a dialogue between Sam and Leticia about eating when you don’t have very much time. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sam: Wait a second. Is this all you’re having for l unch, this microwaved burrito?

Leticia: That’s all I have time for. It’s better th an just eating it out of the package, right?

Sam: That does not look appetizing. I see indigesti on in your future.

Leticia: It’s filling and that’s all I care about. I need to gulp down something before the meeting at 1:00.

Sam: Why don’t you brown bag it? Even if it’s somet hing premade, you won’t have to rely on instant food.

Leticia: Who has the time to prepare a lunch? This burrito is actually more than I eat on most days. Normally, I munch on candy bars o r bags of chips and forgo lunch altogether.

Sam: That’s not very healthy.

Leticia: No, but it keeps me going when I’m on the run on busy days like this. I have a stash in my desk. Do you want to take a look ?

Sam: That collection makes fast food look like haut e cuisine!

Sam says to Leticia, “Wait a second.” We sometimes say this in conversation, informally, when we are surprised by something or d on’t understand something and need to ask someone a question to clarify, to u nderstand better. Sam is apparently confused by something Leticia is doing.

He says, “Wait a second. Is this all you’re having for lunch, this microwaved burrito?” “Microwaved” means something is put into an oven called a “microwave” (microwave). “Microwave” is a verb in E nglish – “to microwave.” A “burrito” (burrito) is a food in the U.S. normally identified with Mexico, even though the burritos you get in the U.S. probably do n’t taste anything like the ones you would get in Mexico.

A “burrito” is a food made with a “tortilla,” which  is a flat, thin piece of dough, that is filled with beans, meat, rice, and cheese. Actua lly, if you go to most parts of Mexico, you won’t really find a burrito, at least in traditional Mexican restaurants. They’re much more popular here in the U.S. You can buy frozen burritos at a grocery store in the U.S. You can take them home an d put them in a microwave to heat them up and eat them. I don’t, but some peo ple do. It’s an easy, quick thing that you can heat up and eat.

Leticia says, “That’s all I have time for,” meaning  she doesn’t have time to prepare any other kind of food. She says, “It’s bet ter than just eating it out of the package, right?” “To eat something out of the packa ge” (package) means to eat something without putting it on a plate first. To b uy something in some sort of container – plastic or cardboard, say – and eating it without putting it on a plate. Some people do that when they are in a hurry. They may eat food right out of the package.

Sam says, “That does not look appetizing.” “Appetiz ing” (appetizing) means it makes you want to eat something because it looks go od or it smells good. Sam says that this microwaved burrito “does not look ap petizing.” He says, instead, “I see indigestion in your future.” “Indigestion” (ind igestion) is pain or discomfort you feel in your stomach after you eat food that is n’t very good, or food that for some reason your body doesn’t like very much. Sam is making a joke here. He says, “I see indigestion in your future,” meaning i f you eat that, you are going to get indigestion. You are going to get some sort of stomach pains or discomfort.

Leticia says, however, “It’s filling and that’s all  I care about.” If you describe food as being “filling” (filling), you mean that it make s you feel full and satisfied so that

you don’t need to eat anything else. Leticia says, “I need to gulp down something before the meeting at one o’clock.” “To gulp” (gulp ) usually means to drink something very quickly. “To gulp down” (down) is a two-word phrasal verb that means to drink or eat something very quickly.

Sam says, “Why don’t you brown bag it?” “To brown b ag” (bag) means to prepare your own lunch at home and bring it with yo u. Traditionally, at least when I was growing up, if you were going to bring your l unch to school or to your job, you would put it in a small paper bag that was brow n in color. Why brown? I don’t know. That’s just what was popular.

We now have a verb “to brown bag,” which means to bring your own lunch from home. When I was in school growing up, we had to br ing our lunch every day to school. The school did not serve lunch. You couldn’ t buy lunch at school. They didn’t give you anything to eat, and since you were  there from eight o’clock in the morning until three or four o’clock in the afternoo n, you had to bring your own food to eat. I had to “brown bag it” every day that  I went to school. I had to bring my own lunch.

Sam asks why Leticia doesn’t bring her own lunch. H e says, “Even if it’s something premade, you won’t have to rely on instan t food.” “Premade” (premade) means that it has already been prepared, usually before you buy it. So, you can buy, say, a salad in the store. We migh t say the salad is “premade.” It’s made for you. You don’t have to do anything. You just have to open up the package and eat it. This way, Sam says, “you won’t have to rely on instant (instant) food.”

“Instant food” is food that is prepared very quickl y, with very little time. A microwave burrito would be an example of instant fo od, I guess. There are also many kinds of soup that you can buy. You just have to add hot water to this little cup and you get a cup of soup. That would be “insta nt soup.” It is made almost instantly, very quickly. Leticia says, “Who has tim e to prepare a lunch? This burrito is actually more than I eat on most days.” “Normally,” she says, “I munch on candy bars or bags of chips and forgo lunch alto gether.”

“To munch (munch) on” something is a two-word phras al verb meaning to eat a small amount of something, but not as part of your meal. If you are, for example, sitting at your desk at work and it’s ten o’clock in the morning, it’s too early for lunch, but you’re hungry. So, you decide to munch o n some potato chips. You open a bag of potato chips and you eat one or two. You are munching on the bag of potato chips. Well, actually you’re munching on the potato chips. If you’re

eating the actual bag that the potato chips are in,  you should probably go and get some real food.

Leticia says she normally munches on candy bars or bags of chips and forgoes lunch altogether. “To forgo” (forgo) means to decid e not to do something that you would normally do. “To forgo a lunch” means not to eat lunch even though normally you would eat lunch. “Altogether” (altoget her) means completely or entirely. Sam says that forgoing lunch altogether is “not very healthy.”

Leticia says, “No” – she agrees – “but it keeps me going when I’m on the run on busy days like this.” “To be on the run” (run) here  means to be doing a lot of different things and going off in different places in a short amount of time. It can just mean to be extremely busy. Usually, though, I think we use this expression when you have to move from one place to another, ei ther within your building where you work or perhaps in the city where you liv e. You have to go to this appointment over here, and then you have another ap pointment in another part of the city, and so forth.

Leticia says, “I have a stash in my desk.” A “stash ” (stash) is a collection of something that you are storing to use in the future . However, usually a stash is put somewhere where other people can’t see it or pe rhaps find it. The word “stash” is often used when we are describing keepin g or storing something illegally, or perhaps for reasons that have to do w ith breaking the law. I have a stash of money that I stole from the bank buried in  my backyard. I’m just kidding. I don’t actually have a stash of money that I stole  from a bank buried in my backyard. It’s somewhere else.

Leticia has a stash of candy bars, I guess, in her desk somewhere – hidden in her desk so no one can find them. “Do you want to t ake a look?” We can guess now that Leticia is at her desk because she is now going to show Sam her stash of food. Sam then says, after looking at it, “That collection makes fast food look like haute cuisine!” “Fast food” is food that is pr epared very quickly that is often not very healthy. A McDonald’s hamburger would be a  good example of “fast food.” We talk about “fast food restaurants” – rest aurants that will give you food very quickly.

The term “haute (haute) cuisine (cuisine)” is origi nally a French one. It refers to high quality food, especially good, French-style fo od. The French, at least in the United States, have the reputation of having excell ent food, as they have that reputation in other countries as well throughout the world. There are actually quite a few French who live in the western part of Los Angeles, in the area where

I live, and there are some apparently excellent Fre nch restaurants here as well. Not as good as in Paris, of course.

Sam is making a joke here. He’s comparing the candy  bars and bags of chips that Leticia is showing him to fast food, saying, “ This is even worse than fast food.” In fact, fast food, compared to that, looks like haute cuisine. It’s much higher in quality than what you are eating, which is worse than fast food.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
