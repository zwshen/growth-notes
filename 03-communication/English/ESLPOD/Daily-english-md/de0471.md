[start of dialogue]

Erin:  So I told Joey that I had no intention of lett ing him use my car again.  Can you believe the nerve of that guy, after what he did?

Curran:  That’s terrible, but I’m going to have to le t you go.  I have an appointment…

Erin:  But I didn’t tell you what else he said.  He sa id that running over my cat was just an accident.  That’s bull.  He said I should be thankful that he took Fifi to a veterinarian!

Curran:  Yeah, I can see why you’re mad.  I think I have  a call on the other line…

Erin:  Well, I’m glad you agree with me.  I said to  him that Fifi may be as good as new now, but that is no thanks to him!  He’s never liked  Fifi and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was gunning for her when he ran her ove r.  He should count himself lucky he’s getting off scot-free for trying to kill my cat.  I said…

Curran:  Sorry to have to cut this short, but I really h ave to get going.

Erin:  Oh, sure, but just let me tell you what I plan to do if he asks me again.

Curran:  I really want to hear all about it, but…but …nature calls!

 Erin:  Oh, okay, call me back.  I haven’t even told you wh at Sam told me about Ben yesterday.  It’s a real shocker!

Curran:  Uh…right.  I can’t wait to hear all about it .

[end of dialogue]

We’re in the middle of a conversation between Erin and  Curran; Erin says, “So I told Joey that I had no intention of letting him use m y car again.”  “Intention” is a plan to do something, what you plan on doing.  Erin sa id she had “no intention,” meaning she wasn’t going to let Joey use her car again.   She says, “Can you believe the nerve of that guy, after what he did?”  the expression “the nerve,” especially “can you believe the nerve” or “that guy has a l ot of nerve,” means your willingness or ability to do something that is inapp ropriate, disrespectful, something that will make someone else angry, something that is not right.  “That guy has a lot of nerve,” meaning he is doing something wrong and he knows it, and it is bothering me.  Erin says, “Can you believe the nerve of that guy (of Joey)?” meaning he’s doing something that he shouldn’t b e doing by asking her to use her car again.

Curran says, “That’s terrible, but I’m going to have to  let you go.”  “To let someone go” means, in this case, to end a phone call or a  personal conversation.  The idea is that you are going to let the  other person continue with what they were doing or what they need to do, althoug h the real intention – the real reason is so that you can go back and do what you wan t to do.  So when someone says, “I’ll let you go,” often they mean “I nee d to go,” but it’s a polite way of saying I don’t want to take up any more of your t ime.  There’s a couple of different meanings of this expression, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Curran says, “I have an appointment.”  Erin, however, d oesn’t want to stop talking.  She says, “But I didn’t tell you what else he sa id.  He (Joey) said that running over my cat was just an accident.”  “To run over” means that your car goes over something; if you run over a cat, you’re probabl y going to kill it – unless it’s a very strong cat!  Erin says, “That’s bull,” spea king of what Joey said. “Bull,” here, means something that is not true, somethi ng that is a lie.  It’s actually a short form for another expression, which is vulgar – a bad expression that begins with the letter “S” and ends with the letter “ T”.  Well, this is an informal expression; you wouldn’t want to use this in your work en vironment.  When you say “that’s bull” or “bull,” that’s an informal way to e xpress that you know that this is wrong.  Erin says, “Joey said I should be thankful that he took Fifi to a

 veterinarian!”  Fifi is Erin’s cat.  A “veterinarian” is a doctor who takes care of animals such as dogs and cats.

Curran says, “Yeah, I can see why you’re mad (I understand  why you are angry). I think I have a call on the other line.”  “To have a  call on the other line” means you have another call – another phone call that you rece ive while you are talking to someone else.  You may have two phones or you may have p hones with the service that allows another person to call and to let you know by a small beep that you hear when you’re talking to someone else.  Curr an, of course, is looking for an excuse to end the conversation, that’s why he says “I think I have a call on the other line.”  Of course, we know that’s probably bu ll!

Erin says, “Well, I’m glad you agree with me,” and of co urse, she continues talking.  She says, “I said to Joey that Fifi may be as goo d as new now, but that is no thanks to him!”  The expression “to be as good as new ” means that something has been damaged or injured but now it is ju st like it were new, just as if nothing had happened to it.  So Fifi, apparently,  is alive.  I thought for sure she would die when the car ran over her, but she’s a strong  cat!  Erin says, though, that Fifi is okay, no thanks to Joey.  “No thanks to (someo ne)” is an informal expression used to emphasize that that person didn’t do an ything to help, that it is not because of what the other person did, that pers on was not responsible for what happened.

Erin says, “He’s never liked Fifi and I wouldn’t be surpr ised if he was gunning for her when he ran her over.”  “To gun for (someone or s omething),” especially if you’re in a car, means to go faster, to increase your sp eed so that you can hit someone.  This, of course, is very dangerous; you don’t want  to do this with a human being, you could hurt them or even kill them.  Joe y, however, I guess doesn’t like Fifi – I can understand why – and he is gunn ing for her, tries to kill her with the car.  Or at least, that’s what Erin thinks.   She says, “He should count himself lucky he’s getting off scot-free for trying to kill my cat.”  The expression “to count yourself lucky” means to realize or recognize that  you have had very good luck, that you are fortunate.  This often is used wh en something almost bad happens to someone, or someone does something wrong and they’re not being punished for it – they should count themselves lucky.  Joey sho uld count himself lucky that he’s getting off scot-free.  This expression, “to get off scot-free,” means not to be punished for something that you have done w rong, not to be criticized for something that you have done wrong.  We usually use t his expression when it is clear or obvious that the person is guilty but, for wha tever reason, does not get punished, for example does not go to jail if they commit  a crime (do something against the law).

 Curran does not want to continue talking to Erin, so fi nally he says, “Sorry to have to cut this short, but I really have to get going.”  Curran is trying to be very polite at the beginning, but as time passes he is more a nd more direct with Erin. He’s still being polite, but he’s trying to be more insi stent – more forceful.  He says, “Sorry to have to cut this short.”  “To cut (something ) short” means to end something before it has finished, usually because you don’t  have any more time. Curran is saying he has to cut this telephone conversation  short, he has to end it, he really has to get going.  When you say, “I have to get  going,” you mean I have to leave, I have to go away, I have to depart.

Erin says, “Oh, sure, but just let me tell you what I pla n to do if he asks me again.”  Erin will still not stop talking.  Curran the n uses another excuse; he says, “I really want to hear all about it, but nature call s!”  The expression “nature calls” is an informal one used to mean that you have to go to the bathroom, so that you cannot stay any longer – you cannot talk any longer, “natu re calls.”  Erin says, “Oh, okay, call me back.  I haven’t even told you what Sa m told me about Ben yesterday.  It’s a real shocker!”  A “shocker” is something th at is very surprising, very unexpected.  Curran says, “Uh…right.  I can’t wait to h ear all about it.”  Of course, he doesn’t want to hear all about it, but he’s being polite.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
