This episode is a dialogue between June and Wally a bout making sure you protect your skin when you are outside and the sun is shining. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

June: Wait! You forgot your sun hat.  

Wally: I’m not wearing that hat. It looks ridiculou s on me.  

June: It’ll protect you from the sun’s rays. You’re  too fair to be outdoors for long without protection. You don’t want to get another s unburn. 

Wally: I’m wearing sunscreen. I’ll be fine. 

June: This ChapStick has an SPF of 100. You’ll need  that, too. 

Wally: All right. Anything else? 

June: Yes, these sunglasses will protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. 

Wally: Okay, I’m leaving now. I’m surprised you did n’t get me some protective clothing. My arms and legs are exposed. 

June: I’m glad you reminded me. Here’s a sun cape. It’s made of a breathable fabric. Make sure you wear it every minute you’re o utside. Promise? 

Wally: [sigh]

Here comes the sun Here comes the sun, and I said It’s alright . . .  

Oh, sorry. On this episode, we listen to June and W ally talking about the fascinating subject of sun protection. Well, it’s n ot fascinating. It’s not really that interesting, but it is important and so we’re going  to talk about it. June says to Wally, “Wait, you forgot your sun hat.” A “sun hat”  is a large hat that sits on your head – where all hats go - but has what we call a l arge “brim” (brim). That’s the part of the hat that sticks straight out, and in th is case would help protect your face from the sun so that you don’t get the sun com ing down directly on your face, if you will.  

Wally says, “I’m not wearing that hat. It looks rid iculous on me.” Wally means it looks funny. It looks stupid. It looks weird. June,  however, says, “It’ll protect you from the sun’s rays.” The “rays” (rays) of the sun are the lines of light, I guess we could call them, that come from the sun. June says,  “You’re too fair to be outdoors for long without protection. You don’t wan t to get another sunburn.” We talk about people’s skin being “fair” when it is, l ike my skin, very white and gets sunburned very easily.  

“Sunburn” (sunburn) is when you are out in the sun too much and your skin turns red, and it can be very painful. June is telling Wa lly that he’s too fair to be outdoors for long without protection. In other word s, his skin is too light. It’s too white. He will get sunburned unless he has some pro tection. The word “outdoors” (outdoors) – one word – refers to the opposite of b eing inside. You are either indoors or outdoors. You’re either in a building or  a house, or you’re outside of a building or a house. I guess you could be in a car,  too.  

Wally is “too fair to be outdoors for long without protection,” June says. “Protection” here would be something that prevents you from getting hurt – in this case, something that prevents you from getting a su nburn. Wally says, “I’m wearing sunscreen. I’ll be fine.” “Sunscreen” (suns creen) – one word – is a cream, lotion, or spray that you apply to your skin  that has special chemicals that will protect your skin, will prevent the skin from getting sunburned even if you are outside in the sun.  

Now, sunscreens have different ratings depending on  how strong they are, how much protection they provide. This rating system is  called the “SPF” – the “Sun Protection Factor,” or indicator. The highest, or o ne of the highest, SPF numbers  

you can get is 100. Someone like me, who has very f air skin, has to use a very high SPF sunscreen. June is worried more than just about Wally’s skin. She’s also worried about his lips, which can get sunburne d as well.  

That’s why she says, “This ChapStick has an SPF of 100. You’ll need that, too.” “ChapStick” (chapstick) is actually the name of a k ind of lip covering, or lip “balm” (balm), to protect your lips from getting dry, or i n this case, from getting sunburned. However, just like the word “Kleenex,” w hich is also the name of a kind of tissue, the word “ChapStick” is now often u sed to refer to any kind of lip balm – the way in some countries people talk about a “coca” when they are referring to any kind of soft drink.  

Wally says, “All right. Anything else?” June says, “Yes, these sunglasses will protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful ultraviole t rays.” “Sunglasses” are special glasses that have dark lenses, dark pieces of glass or plastic that cover your eyes to make sure that you can see more easily  when it is very sunny out and also that protect your eyes – at least, some su nglasses do. The sun has different kinds of light, different kinds of rays. One of them is “ultraviolet rays.” Ultraviolet rays or “ultraviolet light” is a kind o f light that you can’t see – at least, human beings can’t see – but it can damage or hurt your skin and your eyes.  

Wally says, “Okay, I’m leaving now.” He’s not very happy that June, who we guess is his mother, is telling him to do all of th ese things. He just wants to leave. He makes a little joke. He says, “I’m surprised you  didn’t get me some protective clothing.” “Protective clothing” would be special c lothing to protect you from the light of the sun. Wally says, “My arms and legs are  exposed.” “To be exposed” (exposed) means not to be protected or hidden or co vered.  

June, however, responds, “I’m glad you reminded me.  Here’s a sun cape.” A “cape” (cape) is a large piece of fabric that you p ut around your neck and you tie it to your neck. It covers your shoulders. You can think of the famous superhero, Superman. Superman has a cape that he wears, or at least I’m told he wears it. So, June has gotten Wally this special cape, which of course would look ridiculous, especially on a man, unless you’re Supe rman.  

June also says the cape is “made of breathable fabr ic.” “Fabric” (fabric) refers to the material that clothing is made out of. “Breatha ble (breathable) fabric,” would be fabric that allows air to pass through easily so  that you don’t sweat or get too hot. June wants Wally to wear this cape. She says, “Make sure you wear it every minute you’re outside. Promise?” The verb “to promi se” (promise) means to agree that you will do something – to say that you will do it, and if you don’t do it, you will accept some sort of consequence.   

 When June says, “Promise?” she means, “Do you promi se to do these things?” Wally doesn’t respond. He just sighs. He goes [sigh ], which of course means he’s frustrated or angry with his mother.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
