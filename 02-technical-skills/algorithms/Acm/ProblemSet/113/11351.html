k - 1 people are skipped and the k-th man is executed. The elimination proceeds
around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people
are removed), until only the last man remains.</p>

<p>You are given number of people standing in the circle, and number k.
You must find the number of last man, who standing in the circle.</p>
	
<p><h4>INPUT:</h4>
The first line contains integer k (0 &#60 k &#60= 100), it is the number of tests.
On each of next k lines there are 2 integers n (0 &#60 n &#60= 10<sup>5</sup>) and
k (0 &#60 k &#60= 10<sup>9</sup>).</p>
    
<p><h4>OUTPUT:</h4>
For each test case out line formatter like this: "<code>Case i: a</code>". Where "<code>i</code>"
is a test number, and "<code>a</code>" is the last man standing in the circle (see examples).</p>
