This episode is a dialogue between Josephine and Ray tal king about children who behave – who act in a nice way, and sometimes in a no t nice way.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Josephine:  Hello.

Ray:  Hi, Josephine, it’s Ray.  We have a meeting today at  10 a.m. and I was wondering if you would mind if I brought my kids with me.  Their babysitter didn’t show up.

Josephine:  Oh, sure.  That’s no problem.  Your children  are so well-behaved. Even at their age, they have impeccable manners.

Ray:  Well, they’re not always little angels, but they’re  not too much of a handful, thank goodness.

Josephine:  You know what they say: Girls are made of sugar  and spice and everything nice…

Ray:  It is probably a little easier with two girls.  I  feel sorry for my mother who raised six boys.

Josephine:  Six boys!

 Ray:  Yeah, and before we were born, my father though t that children should be seen but not heard.  Was he in for a rude awakening!  We were all very unruly. Imagine six boys only one year apart.  We got yelled at a lot for being naughty.

Josephine:  But that’s how boys are, aren’t they?  Girls a re different.  They’re quiet, sweet, and even-tempered.  What’s that noise?

Ray:  That noise is my daughters creating a ruckus fightin g tooth and nail over a toy.  So much for quiet, sweet, and even-tempered!

Our dialogue begins with Josephine answering the teleph one, “Hello.”  Ray says, “Hi, Josephine, it’s Ray (meaning this is Ray calling you).   We have a meeting today at 10 a.m. (10 o’clock in the morning) and I was w ondering if you would mind if I brought my kids with me.”  “I was wondering ( I wasn’t sure) if you would mind (meaning if you care; if it’s important to you; i f it bothers you) if I brought my kids (my children) with me.  Their babysitter didn’t show up.”  A “babysitter” is someone who watches your children while you go and have a nice dinner and a movie.  The expression “to show up” means to arrive, to go  to some appointment that you have, to be somewhere that you are supposed to be.

Well, the babysitter didn’t show up, didn’t come to Ray’ s house, and so now he needs to bring the children to his business meeting.  Josep hine says, “Oh, sure. That’s no problem.  Your children are so well-behaved.”   To be “well-behaved” (behaved) means that you act in a way that is nice, that follows the rules, that doesn’t bother other people.  Typically, it’s a way that we would describe children, not adults.  But, you can say “That child is ver y well-behaved,” meaning they don’t yell, they don’t scream, they are very polite.  Josephine says that Ray’s children are well-behaved.  “Even at their age,” sh e says, “they have impeccable manners.”  “Even at” in this case means surprisin gly.  Their age is obviously young, and yet they still have good manners.  “M anners” describes the way that you act, the way that you behave.  “Impeccable” m eans perfect, no problems.  Someone with impeccable manners is someone who  always says the right thing, who does the right thing, who’s never rud e, who is always polite.

Ray says, “Well, they’re not always little angels, but they’ re not too much of a handful, thank goodness.”  Ray says his children are not alw ays “little angels,” that would be a child who behaved perfectly.  An “angel ” is a spirit in many religions that is usually described as being good, as being  perfect.  Unless, of course, it’s a bad angel, that would be what we would call a devil.  That’s also

 what we call some of the children who live near my house!   But, back to the story: Ray says his children are not always perfect, “they’re n ot always little angels, but they’re not too much of a handful.”  When  we say something is a “handful” (handful) we mean they are a lot of work or  it is a lot of work, something that is difficult to manage.  They’re not much – or too  much of a handful, thank goodness.  By the way, “handful” has some other meanings that you can find in our Learning Guide.  The expression “thank goodness” is u sed to show your appreciation, your gratitude when you want to thank some one.  Often we use it to express relief, meaning you think something bad is going to happen, and then it doesn’t.  We say you are relieved, you are happy the bad  thing didn’t happen. Well here, Ray says, “thank goodness,” thank goodness that h is children are well-behaved.  He’s appreciating, or he is thankful for that.

Josephine says, “You know what they say: Girls are made of su gar and spice and everything nice.”  “Girls are made of sugar and spice  and everything nice” means that little girls never cause problems.  Ray says, “It  is probably a little easier with two girls.”  Ray obviously has two girls.  He sa ys, “I feel sorry for my mother who raised six boys.”  “To feel sorry for (someone )” means that you are sympathetic; you feel sympathy, you feel sad or bad about  a difficult situation that this other person is in.

Josephine says, “Six boys!”  Ray says, “Yeah, and before we wer e born, my father thought that children should be seen but not heard.”  This is an old expression: “Children should be seen (you can see them) but  not heard (you shouldn’t be able to hear them.”  In other words, the  children should be quiet; they should not talk.  Ray says that his father, unfortunat ely, was in for a rude awakening.  Something that is “rude” is something that is not nice, something that is unpleasant.  An “awakening” is when, literally, you wake up; you’re sleeping and then you wake up.  A “rude awakening,” th en, would be something that surprises you, something very negative.  You thought it was going to be positive, but then suddenly you find out that it is very un pleasant.  It’s an unpleasant surprise, a not nice surprise.

Ray says that he and his brothers were all very unruly.  “To  be unruly” (unruly) means difficult to manage, difficult to keep calm, uncon trollable.  Again, it’s a way you might describe children, but you could also use this ad jective to describe a group of adults who are acting or behaving very badly, yel ling and shouting and so forth.  It’s often used to describe a crowd – a larg e group of people who are behaving badly, kind of like at a British soccer game – som ething like that!  Ray says, “Imagine six boys only one year apart,” meaning that o ne was born, for example, in 1955, the next one was born in 1956, the  next one was born in 1957,

 and so forth.  They’re only one year apart – one-year di fference in their ages.  He says that he and his brothers got yelled at a lot for bei ng naughty.  “To yell (yell) at (someone)” means to shout at them, to say very negative  things to them. “Naughty” (naughty) is a somewhat old-fashioned word in American English; it means to behave badly.  Typically we use this in describing  children – small children who are not well-behaved.

Josephine says, “But that’s how boys are, aren’t they?  Gir ls are different. They’re quiet, sweet, and even-tempered.”  “To be sweet ,” in describing a person, could mean that they are nice, they are kind, th ey are pleasant.  “Sweet” has several other meanings in English, those can be found in the Learning Guide.  “To be even-tempered” means that you are very ca lm, you don’t get very excited.  You’re not very happy, you’re not very sad; you’re sort of very calm and relaxed.  That’s even-tempered (tempered).

Then Josephine says, “What’s that noise?”  Ray says, “That n oise is my daughters creating a ruckus fighting tooth and nail over a toy.”  So the two daughters are making noise; they’re creating a ruckus (rucku s).  A “ruckus” is a noisy, confusing situation.  Often it’s related to an arg ument – a fight that two people are having.  It could be used to describe adults as well as children. “What’s all this ruckus in here?” a father might say to his sons who are in their room fighting about something.  That never happened to me, of course!

Ray says that the girls are fighting tooth and nail (nai l).  This expression, “tooth and nail,” means very strongly, perhaps violently, maybe th ey’re hitting each, but with a lot of strength – a lot of effort.  Usually it ’s used with the verb “to fight.”  It could be used to describe, for example, a company that is fighting tooth and nail to survive.  They’re fighting very hard – they’re working ve ry hard to survive.  Ray finally says, “So much for quiet, sweet, and even-tempere d!”  “So much for (something)” is a phrase that we use jokingly to show that  something that you thought that was true is not true, or that there isn’t  very much of something when you expected there to be a lot of something.  It’s used, we would say, sarcastically.  Ray is saying here that the daughters are not  the way Josephine described girls, they’re not quiet, sweet, and even-tempe red.  Right after they finished talking about how nice girls are, of course, the  girls have a fight.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
