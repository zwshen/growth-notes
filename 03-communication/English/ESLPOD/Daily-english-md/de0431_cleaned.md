This episode is called “Health in Developing Countries,”  countries that are still growing.  It’s a dialogue between Silvia and Hermann about common problems in these countries.  Let’s listen: 

[start of dialogue] 

Silvia:  What are you watching? 

Hermann:  I’m watching a show about the health probl ems in developing countries. 

Silvia:  Don’t we have enough healthcare problems here,  in this country?   

Hermann:  We do, but there are countries that have a l ot more acute problems than we do. 

Silvia:  Oh, those kids are so cute. 

Hermann:  Yeah, but a lot of them are going to die of malnutrition and infectious diseases, things that are preventable.   

Silvia:  I thought the biggest problem was the spread of AIDS and HIV.   

Hermann:  Those are huge problems, no question about it, but a lot of people die of other preventable diseases, too, such as malaria, tube rculosis, and measles. Believe it or not, we’ve had immunizations for measles fo r over 40 years! 

 Silvia:  That’s terrible.  I can see why you’re studying me dicine.  I wish I could be a doctor. 

Hermann:  You could, but first, you’ll need to get over  your fear of blood.

Silvia begins by asking Hermann, “What are you watching?” – what are you watching on TV?  Hermann says, “I’m watching a show abou t the health problems in developing countries.”  Again, a “developing  country” is a country usually that has lower income and often many health pr oblems.  To “develop” means to grow, to become larger; that’s another possible  meaning.  Usually, a developing country is a country that still has some serious e conomic problems. 

Silvia says, “Don’t we have enough healthcare problems he re, in this country?” “Healthcare” (one word) is the system and practice for taki ng care of people who are sick, trying to make them healthier.  Hermann says, “We  do (we do have many problems here in our country), but there are coun tries that have a lot more acute problems than we do.”  “Acute,” here, means very se rious, severe, strong. “Acute” has a couple of different meanings in English; t ake a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Hermann points out that a lot of the children are goi ng to die of malnutrition and infectious diseases, things that are preventable.  “Maln utrition” means poor nutrition.  “Nutrition” is a word that describes, in t his case, food (what people eat). So, “malnutrition” is not having enough good food, he althy food.  Sometimes this causes more health problems when someone doesn’t have enou gh to eat. “Infectious diseases” are diseases that can be passed from on e person to the next.  They are diseases, we say, that you can “catch” from so meone else, meaning you can get them; they can be transmitted from  one person to another. These sorts of problems, Hermann says, “are preventable.”  Something that is “preventable” can be avoided, it’s not certain it can hap pened.  You can prevent it, you can prevent it from happening; you can stop it f rom happening. 

Silvia says, “I thought the biggest problem was the spread  of AIDS and HIV.” “AIDS” stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  It ’s a disease that usually causes death because your body cannot fight against ot her diseases and infections.  “HIV” stands for human immunodeficiency virus; it’s the virus that can cause AIDS.  Hermann says, “Those are huge problems, no question about it,” meaning absolutely, there’s no doubt that these are ser ious problems (AIDS and HIV), “but a lot of people die of other preventable diseases, too, such as malaria,  

 tuberculosis, and measles.”  “Malaria” is an illness that yo u find in many hot, warm, what we would call “tropical” countries.  It is cau sed by a type of mosquito that spreads the disease.  The “mosquito” is a small flyin g insect; it bites a person.  “Tuberculosis,” which we often in English just cal l “TB” – TB or tuberculosis is a serious disease that affects your lungs, your  ability to breathe; it makes people cough.  Tuberculosis was quite common in the United States and in other countries in the 19th century, especially in large cities.  Tuberculosis is a “communicable” disease, meaning that it’s infectious – you can get it from other people.  Many of my relatives who came to the United Sta tes the 19th century died of tuberculosis, living in large, crowded cities.  “M easles” is a disease that causes, usually, a high “fever,” where the body temperatur e goes up.  You often see small, red spots on a person’s skin when they have measle s.   

Hermann says, “Believe it or not, we’ve had immunization s for measles for over 40 years!”  “Immunization” is protection against gettin g a disease.  Usually it’s an “injection,” what we often call simply a “shot,” where the doctor or nurse takes a long, sharp piece of metal, a “needle,” and puts it in  your arm and “injects,” or puts, medicine into your bloodstream.  I went to the do ctor the other day, recently, and I got a flu shot.  This is a type of immun ization.  Young babies and children often receive several shots to “immunize” (the verb ) them against common diseases like measles.  Sometimes we describe these shot s as “vaccinations.” 

Silvia says, “That’s terrible.  I can see why you’re studying medicine.  I wish I could be a doctor,” Silvia says.  Hermann says, “You could ( you could be a doctor), but first, you’ll need to get over your fear of  blood.”  “Blood,” of course, is the red liquid that flows through your body.  I’m like  Silvia; I could never be a real doctor – a medical doctor.  I don’t like the sight of bl ood either! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
