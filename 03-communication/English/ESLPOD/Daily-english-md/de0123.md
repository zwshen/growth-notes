Well, today’s podcast is about listening to differe nt types of music and the vocabulary that we use to talk about that. The dial ogue begins with Abby saying, “Hey, what are you listening to?” Notice that this is an informal conversation and  

the use of “Hey” (hey) is very common, particularly  among the younger people. “Hey, what are you listening to?” And Bill says, “W ell, right now I’m listening to the Foo Fighter’s latest album.” “The Foo Fighters”  are a popular music group in the United States or used to be anyway. “The latest  album” (album) – an “album” is – can also be called a “record” (record). Now, w e often call it a “CD” – a compact disc – those are all – mean the same thing now. An “album” used to be something that was big and black  and made out of a material called “vinyl.” But now, it’s all digital and we st ill, however, use the term “album.” So, when a group releases – and that’s the verb we use – when they first put out an album, when they first sell an album, we say the y “release” an album. We still use that term. 

“There are some good tracks on this CD,” Bill says,  “including their new single.” A “track” on a CD or on an album – (track) – is a son g. So, a song can be called a “track.” A “single” (single) is a song that a popul ar group writes in order to have it played on the radio in order that it will be popula r. And usually, songs or rather albums or CD’s have a number of singles that the mu sician – that the band hopes will become popular and so, they’ll make a vi deo. a music video, for it. And they will send it to the radio stations.  

Well, Abby says, “Let me see your iPod for a minute .” That expression “let me see” is very common to mean give it to me so I can look at it. “Let me see” means that you have to actually give the thing to t he person. They don’t mean just hold it. Usually it means to give something to  someone. So, “let me see your pen” means give me your pen so I can look at it or whatever I’m doing. Well, Abby says, “Let me see your iPod for a moment” – fo r a minute rather. She says, “It looks like you’ve got a ton of good stuff loade d up.” A “ton” (ton) is just an informal expression – informal use here – means a l ot. If you have a lot of something, you can say, “You have a ton” (ton). “To n” (ton) is also a way of measuring weight in English. And a “ton” is the sam e as 2,000 pounds, depending on the kind of ton. There are actually di fferent kinds of tons. But normally we talk about a ton as 2,000 pounds. But h ere it just means a lot – a large number. 

So, you have a ton of good stuff or good things loa ded up. “To load up” (load) up your iPod, or your mp3 player, means to put things on it. So if you go to your iPod and you load up some podcasts, so you can list en to them on your drive to work, for example. Well, Abby likes Gwen Stefani wh o is a female rock singer – rather Bill likes Gwen Stefani because it’s Bill’s iPod. And he also likes Shakira. Shakira is a Colombian singer who is very popular i n the United States. She records in Spanish and in English. Well, Abby says,  “I had no idea you were a fan of Shakira.” “I had no idea” means I didn’t kno w. I had absolutely no idea. I  

didn’t know that you were a “fan.” A “fan,” of cour se, (fan) – someone who likes a particular group here. Bill says, “I think she’s a really talented singer and songwriter.” A “songwriter” is all one word – (song writer) – is, of course who writes songs and that’s the noun – a “songwriter.” Then Bill says, “And well, she’s hot too.” This is an informal – kind of a slang exp ression. When you say a woman is hot or a man is hot, you mean they’re very beaut iful. And usually, you also mean that they are very sexually attracted – that t hey are very good looking, very pretty, very beautiful. To say something is “hot” n ow has become a common slang term to say, “Oh that’s hot” – means that’s r eally great, that’s wonderful. Mostly a rich American girl, woman, by the name of Paris Hilton, has made that expression very popular, but the expression “She’s hot” or “He’s hot” is actually – goes back several years.  

Well, Abby says, after Bill tells her that Shakira is hot, Abby says, “Yeah, I bet.” “I bet” (bet) means I’m sure that’s true. Here it mean s I’m sure that’s true. It actually, when someone says, “Yeah. I bet” – means that yes, I agree. I’m sure that’s true. But there’s also this idea that they d on’t really like the idea that it is true or there’s some negative meaning, some negativ e idea that they are trying to convey. “To convey” (convey) means to tell you. Som etimes, we use that expression “I bet” when you don’t believe someone. Someone says, “I hear it is going to rain tomorrow.” and you say, “Yeah, I bet.” – means you don’t beli eve it’s going to rain tomorrow. So, it can be very confusing. Usually, however, it means that you agree it’s true even though you don’t particularly like the fact th at it is true. 

Well, Abby says to Bill, “You’ve got some great jaz z and blues standards here. “Jazz,” (jazz) of course, is a style of music that began in the 20’s and 30’s that was originally very popular among African American or black musicians. “Blues” (blues) is even older and is also – comes from the African American people who were living in the early 20th century. Of course, t here are still jazz and blues players. “Blues” tends to be a little more – usuall y a little sadder type of music. Jazz – there’s lots of different kinds of jazz with  all different sorts of instruments – musical instruments. A “standard” – when we are tal king about a song. A “standard” (standards) – a “standard” is the same a s a classic. It’s a song that was very popular many years ago. And that it was – the fact that it was very popular means that people still listen to it. So, a  jazz standard or a blues standard would be a song from the past that’s still  very popular today.  

Bill’s iPod has Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington, those are two jazz artists, and Billy Holiday, who was a blues artist. When we say an “artist” (artist) – just like an artist who paints a picture, you can also be a “rec ording artist,” meaning you make – you’re a singer or a musician who makes albu ms. Abby also says that  

Bill has some “Greatest Hits” and some “bootleg stu ff” too. “Greatest Hits” – two words – are the most popular songs of a group and o ften the group after several years, will put out an album. “To put out” means th e same as to release an album, to start selling an album. They’ll put out a n album of “Greatest Hits” – their best, most popular songs. “Bootleg” (bootleg) – all  one word – is an illegal recording, usually at a concert where someone recor ds the band and then sells it even though they do not have permission – they’re n ot supposed to. Abby also says that she didn’t know Bill was such a “jazz buf f.” To be a “jazz buff” (buff) means the same as a jazz fan – someone who likes ja zz music.  

Well, Abby says that she wants to borrow Bill’s iPo d and Bill says, “Yeah, right.” “Yeah (yeah) right” – when someone says, “Yeah, rig ht” they mean no you can’t or I don’t believe that. “It’s going to rain tomorr ow.” “Yeah, right” means no, it’s not going to rain tomorrow. You don’t think it’s go ing to rain tomorrow. Instead Bill says, “Hand it over.” “Hand (hand) it over” means g ive it back to me. “Hand it over” – it’s kind of a – there’s some negative conn otation. Negative idea behind hand it over. You’re demanding, you’re almost forci ng the person to give it back to you- to give something to you. Someone who is go ing to steal your wallet might say, “Hand it over” because you don’t have a choice. Bill says, “Hand it over.” 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
