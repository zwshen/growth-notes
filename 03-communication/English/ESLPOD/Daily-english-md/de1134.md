[start of dialogue]

Selena: Don’t look now, but a big group of mothers are coming to this house to give you a piece of their mind.

Justin: What?! I meant it as a joke. I didn’t mean anything by it.

Selena: You’ll have to tell that to Sally. She’s at  the head of the group and she’s flanked by Maria and Veronica.

Justin: Oh no, not them. I’d rather be confronted b y anyone but those three.

Selena: They’re not the only ones. They’re backed b y a group of at least 15 parents.

Justin: Maybe some of those on the periphery are ju st spectators, waiting to see what the rest of the group will do.

Selena: Don’t count on it. They look determined.

Justin: Who are those in the back?

Selena: Those bringing up the rear? I think those a re a few fathers with a message of their own.

Justin: What should I do now?

Selena: Start by waving a white flag.

 Justin: And then?

Selena: Try a sincere apology, with a healthy dose of groveling.

[end of dialogue]

Our somewhat mysterious dialogue begins with Selena  saying to Justin, “Don’t Look now.” The expression “Don’t look now” is used to warn someone that something bad is happening, or that an unwanted per son is walking toward you or is nearby. “Don’t look now, but I think that’s y our mother-in-law in the car,” speaking of unwanted people. Well, Selena is warnin g Justin not about a mother- in-law, but “a big group of mothers.”

She says, “Don’t look now, but a big group of mothe rs are coming to this house to give you a piece of their mind.” “To give someon e a piece of your mind” means to clearly state your opinion or tell your opinion to someone, usually in anger or with some frustration toward the other person. “I’m  going to give him a piece of my mind” – I’m going to tell him what I think, and I’m going to do it in anger.

Justin says, “What? I meant it as a joke.” We’re no t sure exactly what Justin did that has made these mothers angry at him. That’s wh y it’s something of a mystery, this dialogue. Justin then says, “I didn’t  mean anything by it.” When someone says they “didn’t mean anything by it,” he means he didn’t want to hurt or offend other people by what he has said or what he has done.

After you realize that you’ve done something that s omeone else may consider hurtful, insulting, or harmful, you might say, “Wel l, I didn’t mean anything by it,” meaning you didn’t intend or mean to cause any harm . Of course, some people say that they didn’t mean anything by whatever they  said even though they really did mean to be mean.

You could say to someone for example, “Oh, that’s a  beautiful dress. Are you pregnant?” Well, if the woman isn’t pregnant but ju st is a little overweight, you might be in trouble and you could say, “Oh, I didn’ t mean anything by it,” even though perhaps you meant to be insulting to the wom an. (Something I don’t recommend, whether she’s pregnant or not.)

Selena says, “You’ll have to tell that to Sally. Sh e’s at the head of the group and she’s flanked by Maria and Veronica.” Selena is des cribing where the different women are in this group. She begins by saying that “Sally is at the head (head) of the group.” “To be at the head” of something mea ns to be in front, or it could

also mean to be the leader of a group. “Who’s at the head of the company?” That would mean “Who is the leader of the company?”

In the dialogue, I think Selena is referring to whe re Sally is in the group. She’s the first person. She’s at the front of, or at the head of, the group. Sally is “flanked” (flanked) by Maria and Veronica. “To be f lanked” by someone means to have someone on each side of yourself – to have som eone on your left and to have someone on your right. You are flanked by two people.

Justin says, “Oh no, not them. I’d rather be confro nted by anyone but those three.” “To be confronted” by someone is to have so meone approach you and begin an argument or begin to fight with you. If yo u are confronted by your boss, your boss is going to stop you, perhaps, in the hal lway and argue with you or perhaps ask why you did something wrong. The idea of a “confrontation,” which is the noun that comes from the verb “to confront” is related to an angry situation. It means someone is angry about something, perhaps even wants to fight you over something.

Selena says, “They’re not the only ones. They’re ba cked by a group of at least 15 parents.” “To be backed” (backed) by” someone here I believe means to be followed by someone. There is a group of people tha t are right behind the three women who are in front. “To be backed by” can also mean to be supported by, even financially supported by, a group or a person.  Here in Hollywood, when someone says that he is backing a movie, he means h e is supporting the movie. “The movie is being backed by him.”

Here, it appears these three women are backed by a group of 15 parents. Justin says, “Maybe some of those on the periphery are jus t spectators, waiting to see what the rest of the group will do.” The “periphery ” (periphery) is the outside part of something, or what we might call the “edge” (edg e) of something. It’s not the main part. It’s not the center part of something. W e could talk about suburbs being on the “periphery” of the city. They’re outsi de of the city, on the edge of the city.

A “spectator” (spectator) is someone who watches so mething, who observes something, but does not participate in the activity . If you go to a professional sports game – a soccer game or a baseball game or a n American football game – you’re not actually going down and playing in the  game. You are a spectator. You’re watching it. You’re observing it. There’s ac tually a very well-known, famous magazine in Great Britain called The Spectat or , which I read every week on my iPad. You don’t even have to wait for it to a rrive from London by mail.

Anyway, Justin says that maybe some of the people o n the periphery of this group of parents are just spectators. They’re waiti ng to see what the rest of the group will do. Selena says, however, “Don’t count o n it.” The phrase “Don’t count (count) on it” is used to express doubt that someth ing will happen. “To count on” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to rel y on something or depend on something.

Justin thinks that some of the people approaching h im are just spectators. But Selena says, “Don’t count on it,” meaning you shoul dn’t rely on that fact. Don’t be so sure. She says, “They look determined.” “To be d etermined” means to be committed, to not hesitate or not to be undecided. Justin says, “Who are those in the back?” meaning at the very end of this line of people.

Selena says, “Those bringing up the rear?” “To brin g up the rear” is an expression in English that means to be the last per son, or perhaps in this case the last group of people, in a line of people. This  person or this group is following everyone else. Selena says, “I think those are a fe w fathers with a message of their own.” “A message of their own” means that the se fathers probably are also angry at Justin.

Justin says, “What should I do now?” Selena says, “ Start by waving a white flag.” “To wave (wave) a white flag,” literally means to t ake a piece of white fabric and move it back and forth in the air. The idea is that  you are showing that you do not want to fight anymore. It could also mean that you are surrendering. You are telling the other person or the other group of peop le you are fighting that you don’t want to fight anymore because they have won.

Justin then says, “And then?” meaning, “Then what s hould I do?” Selena says, “Try a sincere apology with a healthy dose of grove ling.” A “sincere (sincere) apology (apology)” is an honest statement that expr esses your regret. It’s when you tell someone that you are sorry and that you fe el badly about whatever it is you did wrong. Selena advises Justin to try a since re apology with these parents and a “healthy dose (dose) of groveling.”

A “healthy dose” of something is a large amount of something. We use the word “dose” normally when we’re talking about medicine. You are given, say, pills by your doctor for some illness. The doctor will tell you what the “dose” is – how many pills you should take each day. A “healthy dos e” of something, however, just means a lot of something. The word “healthy” h ere means a lot of.

“To grovel” (grovel) means to apologize for your bad behavior toward a certain person and to tell the person how great they are. “ To grovel” means to try to

make the person like you by both apologizing and by  telling the person how wonderful he or she is. That’s what Selena recommen ds to Justin – “a healthy dose of groveling.” “Groveling” is the noun form of  the verb “to grovel.” We never find out why these parents are so angry at Justin, but clearly he did something very, very wrong.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
