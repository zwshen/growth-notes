Our story begins with the “principal” of a school, the l eader or head of a school, talking about how one of his “duties,” one of his respon sibilities, is to “hand out,”

 or to give out, awards and scholarships to students.  An “a ward” is something you give a person because they have done something very well.   A “scholarship” is money you give to a person so that he or she can pay for  an education, to go to a school.

“We recently had a ceremony to do just that,” says the man in the story, the principal.  A “ceremony” is a special event that honors a p erson or a group of people.  Usually it’s a somewhat formal event.  “Ceremo ny” has a couple of different meanings in English, however, so take a look at the Learning Guide for this episode for some additional explanations.

The principal says, “We recently had a ceremony to do just that.”  The expression “to do just that” means to do exactly what we were just talking about.  We were talking about handing out awards and scholarships; we had  a ceremony to do just that, to hand out awards and scholarships.

The principal begins first by giving an award to Miguel .  He says, “Miguel, I want to commend (commend) you for your work this year.”  To “co mmend” someone means to praise them, to say publicly that they have done so mething very well. So, he’s commending Miguel for his work, and he congratu lates him for winning the science award.  To “congratulate” means to say you are happy because something good has happened to another person.  If some one gets a new job, you may congratulate them.  If your girlfriend leaves you,  her friends might congratulate her – because they didn’t like you to begin with!

Well, back to the principal.  The principal says the science  award was well deserved.  When we say something is “well deserved,” we me an that something should have happened because this person worked hard for it or did all the things that were necessary.  Something that is well deser ved is something that you have earned.  You have worked for it and now you ge t this reward, and that is only right; that is the correct thing.

The principal then says that the recipient of this year’s co mmunity service award is Monique.  A “recipient” is someone who receives somethi ng, someone to whom something is given.  To be the recipient of an awa rd means that the award was given to you.  This award is for “community service,” for  students who help out in their local community.  The winner is Monique, a nd she won for her outstanding achievements.  Something that is “outstanding ” is something that is very good, something that is very impressive.  An “achievement ” is something that you have done, usually something that’s difficult or  something that is in a specific field.  You may have achievements at work.  You sold  more than anyone

 else, or you did a better project then anyone else; you achieved your goals, you achieved what you wanted to.

So, Monique has had outstanding achievements, she has do ne some very good things.  The principal says, “My heartiest congratulations to you, Monique.” Something that is “hearty” means friendly, happy, someth ing that is sincere, something that you really mean.  So, “heartiest congrat ulations” are my most sincere, my friendliest, my happiest congratulations.

The principal says that he is also proud of one of his oth er students, Yugo, who has been awarded the ESL Podcast award.  To be “awarde d” something means to receive an award, to receive an honor, to receive recog nition.  The Nobel Prizes are among the most important awards in literatu re, science, and so forth. Yugo won the ESL Podcast award, probably for the smart est student since only the smartest people listen to ESL Podcast!

“This prestigious award,” he says, “honors the achievements of outstanding students.”  Something that is “prestigious” is something that is well respected, very important, one of the best.  The Nobel Prizes are p restigious.  If you win one you are considered a very important person.  Now, if you’ re a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and you receive a Nob el Prize, you get your own parking space!  You see, there are very few parking sp aces – good parking spaces – at that university, so if you win a Nobel Prize, we ll, you get a parking space.  In some places, a parking space is as important as winning a prize!

Yugo has won a prestigious award that honors the achievem ents of outstanding students.  The verb “to honor” means to show publicly tha t you have done something very well.  This is something that is usually do ne to someone who is important or someone who has done something that you want other people to know about.  Yugo is told by the principal “a job well done.”  The expression “a job well done” is a phrase used to show that someone has done something very well.  It’s a way of congratulating someone on doing a good job: “a job well done.”

Finally, there is an award given to one of the teachers.   The award is for her dedication to her students and to the school.  “Dedica tion,” here, means commitment, working hard on something.  This teacher ha s worked hard, and so they are recognizing her achievements.  This is Ms. Niehbur winning this award. “I can’t imagine a more deserving teacher,” the princip al says.  Someone who is “deserving” is someone who has earned something for what they have done, someone who should get this award because of all they hav e done.  The

 principal says to Ms. Niehbur, “Please accept my sincere congr atulations.”  This is a somewhat formal expression to congratulate someone: “please accept my sincere congratulations.”  You are telling someone you are very happy or proud of what he or she has done.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. > Part of my job as school principal is to hand out awards a nd scholarships to students.  We recently had a ceremony to do just that. .....
> Principal:  Miguel, I want to commend you for your work this year and congratulate you for winning the science award.  It is we ll deserved.
> The recipient of this year’s community service award is Moni que for her outstanding achievements.  My heartiest congratulations to you, Monique.
> I am also very proud of another one of our students, Yug o, who has been awarded the ESL Podcast award.  This prestigious award h onors the achievements of outstanding students.  Yugo, a job well d one.
> Finally, we are also honoring one of our teachers today.   For her dedication to her students and to the school, we are recognizing the ach ievements of Ms. Niehbur.  I cannot imagine a more deserving teacher.  Please accept my sincere congratulations.
