This episode is a dialogue between Miles and Yuki a bout getting your car fixed when someone has hit it. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Miles: It’s something, isn’t it?

Yuki: Yeah, it’s something all right. Where did you  get this heap?

Miles: My uncle sold it to me. This car has been si tting in his garage for years and he finally said I could have it for a good pric e. I need some auto body work done on it. There’s a little damage and I want to make it look good again.

Yuki: A little damage?! The bumpers are falling off  and the frame is bent. Was this car in an accident? I’m worried about its stru ctural integrity.

Miles: It was in a small accident, but none of thes e cosmetic things affects how it runs.

Yuki: I mean there are dents and dings everywhere, and paint scratches so deep you might need to get a whole new paint job.

Miles: I’m sure you can work your magic on it and make it look new again.

Yuki: Wait a second. There’s rust all over the unde rcarriage.

Miles: When do you think you can have it ready for me to pick up?

Yuki: It’s ready now.

Miles: Now?

Yuki: Yes, this car is ready for you to pick up and  take to a salvage yard!

Miles begins with saying, “It’s something, isn’t it ?” The meaning of this expression depends on how it is said and the contex t or situation in which it is said. It could mean it’s something really good. It’ s something fantastic. It could also mean that it isn’t very good. I think Miles sa ys it in a way that suggests that it is something good. He’s talking about a car that his uncle sold to him. Yuki, however, doesn’t agree. She says, “Yeah, it’s somet hing all right.” The addition of that expression “all right” is used here to indicat e that perhaps what the other person said isn’t correct or perhaps isn’t complete .

Yuki says, “Where did you get this heap (heap)?” “H eap” is usually a large number of objects that are on top of each other, th at aren’t organized in any way. You could have a “heap of papers” – a bunch of or c ollection of papers on your desk that aren’t organized in any way. It looks rat her messy. In this case, however, she’s referring to the car as being a coll ection of pieces that aren’t organized very well. It’s just another way of sayin g “this piece of junk” (junk), which is something you would normally throw away. I f we use the word “heap” to describe a car, we mean it’s not a very good car.

Miles says, “My uncle sold it to me.” This car has been sitting in his garage for years and he finally said I could have it for a goo d price.” Miles says, “I need some auto body work done on it. There’s a little da mage and I want to make it look good again.” “Auto body” refers to the outside  of the car, or more specifically, work done to repair the way a car loo ks. So, if you say you need “auto body work,” you mean you need the outside of your car fixed. We’re not talking about the motor or the engine part of the c ar.

Yuki says, “A little damage?!” She is surprise that  Miles is describing his car as having a “little,” or not very much, damage. She sa ys, “The bumpers are falling off and the frame is bent.” The “bumpers” (bumpers)  of a car are the parts that are in the front and the back that are supposed to protect the car if you get into an accident, if you hit some thing or some other ca r. “The bumpers are falling off,” she says, meaning they are about to come off of the car because they’re not attached properly or because they’re so old.

“The frame is bent” (bent), Yuki says. Something th at is “bent” is something that is not straight the way it should be. The “frame” of a car is the basic structure of

the car. If you can think of the car without any of  the doors or engine or other parts that make the car run, that would be the “fra me” of the car, sort of like your skeleton in your body consists of the bones in your  body, and then you have everything around and on top of your bones. Well, the frame of the car is like the skeleton of the car.

“Was this car in an accident?” Yuki asks. “I’m worr ied about its structural integrity.” The “structure” (structure) of somethin g is similar to the frame or skeleton of an object. It gives it its basic shape.  “Structural integrity” (integrity) refers to how strong that structure is, how well th at structure will survive, say, other damage. The “structural integrity” of a bridg e refers to how strong the bridge is – whether the bridge is going to stay up or not. Yuki is talking about the structural integrity of the car.

Miles says, “It was in a small accident, but none of these cosmetic things affects how it runs.” “Cosmetic” (cosmetic) is an adjective  that describes the way something looks. In this case, we might think of it  as the outside part of the car – not how it functions, not how it works. Miles uses the verb “run” (run) to describe how the car functions. He says, “None of these cosm etic things,” or cosmetic damage, “affects” or has any influence on how the c ar operates, “how it runs.”

Yuki says, “I mean there are dents and dings everyw here, and paint scratches so deep you might need a whole new paint job.” A “dent ” (dent) is created when you take something that is flat and you hit it, say wit h a hammer or another hard object. If you do that to a piece of metal, it will  create a dent in the metal. It’s not a hole – it doesn’t go through the metal – but it b ends the metal, causing a dent in the metal.

A “ding” (ding) is a very small dent in a car. If y ou park your car next to another car and the person in the car next to you opens his  door and it hits the side of your door in a very strong or forceful way, it migh t cause a “ding” in the side of your door, a small dent. Yuki also mentions “paint scratches” (scratches). A “scratch” is a small line in a painted object. So, if you have red paint on the side of your car and there’s a scratch in it, you may se e white – that would be the metal underneath the paint.

The scratches are so deep, Yuki says, that Miles “m ight need a whole new paint job.” A “paint job” is when you have to repaint, or  put new paint on the entire car. A “deep scratch” is one that goes far into the meta l so that it can’t be easily fixed by just putting a little paint on top of that area.  Miles says, “I’m sure you can work your magic on it and make it look new again.” Appar ently Miles is asking Yuki to

do the auto body work. “To work your magic” means to use your skills in such a way as to make something better again or perfect ag ain.

Yuki says, “Wait a second. There’s rust all over the undercarriage.” “Rust” (rust) is another word for what we could also refer to as “oxidation,” in a technical sense. It’s a reddish-orange powder that appears on  metal when it has been damaged by having water on it. Rust is not a good t hing for the metal, of course, because it can make the metal weaker. It can actual ly cause the metal to disintegrate or to break up into small pieces. The “undercarriage” (undercarriage) of a car is the bottom of the car, usually includin g the bottom of the frame and the wheels.

Miles says, “When do you think you can have it read y for me to pick up?” So we learn now that Yuki works at the auto body shop, the place where he is bringing the car to be fixed. He wants to know when Yuki can  finish fixing it. Yuki says, “It’s ready now.” Miles says, “Now?” He’s confused because he just, of course, brought the car to Yuki. Yuki is making something of a joke. She says, “Yes, this car is ready for you to pick up,” meaning to take a way, “and to take to a salvage yard.”

A “salvage (salvage) yard (yard)” is a place where there are a lot of old cars and other machines that no longer work and that are use d only for their “parts” (parts), meaning people take the cars apart, or the  other machines, and they reuse the different parts from those cars or machin es for other things, or for other cars and machines. What Yuki is saying is that it is not possible to fix this old car, that it would be better for Miles simply to take it  and perhaps sell it to the salvage yard since no one would want to drive the car anymo re as it is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Yuki: Yeah, it’s something all right. Where did you  get this heap?

Yuki: Yes, this car is ready for you to pick up and  take to a salvage yard!
