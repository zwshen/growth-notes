[start of dialog]

Eleanor:  Isn’t it a beautiful day?  The sun is shi ning; the birds are singing.  It’s good to be alive!

Porter:  Okay, Pollyanna, go spread good cheer some where else.

Eleanor:  What’s wrong with you?  You must have wok en up on the wrong side of the bed.

Porter:  I’m just having a bad day – no, make that a bad month.  Nothing is going my way.

Eleanor:  Cheer up!  Every cloud has a silver linin g and it’s no use crying over spilled milk.

Porter:  Spare me your platitudes, and let me wallo w in my own misery.

Eleanor:  I can’t do that.  If your work isn’t goin g well, then practice makes perfect.  You’ll just do better next time.

Porter:  It’s not my work.

Eleanor:  Is it your girlfriend?  If your girlfrien d isn’t being nice to you then there are plenty of fish in the sea.  Don’t you see?  Wha tever the problem is, it’s not the end of the world.

Porter:  My biggest problem right now is easy to fi x.

 Eleanor:  How?

Our dialog begins with Eleanor saying to Porter, “I sn't it a beautiful day? The sun is shining” – the sun is out – “the birds are singi ng. It's good to be alive!” Eleanor is very happy, but Porter is not. Porter said, “Oka y Pollyanna, go spread cheer somewhere else.” “Pollyanna” (Pollyanna) is the nam e of a character from a novel back in 1913, called Pollyanna. Pollyanna was  always happy, always cheerful, always optimistic. Now it's used to descr ibe someone who's like that. She's a Pollyanna. It sometimes used as almost an i nsult, however, to someone who's too happy, who’s too cheery, who's too optimi stic.

“Cheer” (cheer) a noun and a verb. As a verb, it me ans to make someone happy who is sad. As a noun, it means happiness. “To spre ad good cheer” means to make other people happy by smiling, by talking to them and so forth. That's spreading good cheer – spreading happiness, giving other people happiness.

Eleanor says, “What's wrong with you? You must have  woken up on the wrong side of the bed.” “To wake up on the wrong side of the bed” means to be in a very bad mood. I'm not sure exactly why we have this expression. Maybe if you wake up and you get out of bed on the wrong side, y ou'll hit a wall or you’ll fall over or I don't know. But that's the expression – “ to wake up on the wrong side of the bed.” The “bed,” of course, is something that y ou sleep in at night.

Porter says, “I'm just having a bad day – no,  make  that a bad month.” The expression “make that” is used when we want to corr ect something we just said, especially if we are talking about numbers.

Porter says that nothing is going his way. “To go y our way” means to go as you have planned it to go, as you want it to go, to be successful at something that you are attempting to do. That's “to go your way.” Don't confuse this with another expression, “to go your own (own) way.” “To go your  own way” means to do something different from everyone else, to do somet hing that is not like anyone else. I think there was actually a song back in the  70’s by Fleetwood Mac.

“You can go your own way. Go your own way.”

I think a woman sang it, though. Anyway…too much co ffee today, Jeff!

 Porter says that nothing is going his way. Eleanor says “Cheer up” – be happy. “To cheer up” is a phrasal verb. Like a lot of phra sal verbs, it is used to add emphasis. Instead of just saying “cheer,” we would say “cheer up.” You’re telling someone to be happy, to get happier. Eleanor says, “Every cloud has a silver lining.” This is an old expression, an old saying, “Every cloud has a silver lining.” A “cloud” is what's up in the sky. That's where rai n comes from. The expression “a silver lining” means something that is good. For  a cloud to have a silver lining means that even if it's a bad thing that is happeni ng, like a cloud where it might rain, there's something good that may come out of it. It's not completely negative. There's always some positive things that you can fi nd when something bad happens. “Every cloud has a silver lining.”

Eleanor is telling Porter that he needs to cheer up  because even though he's having a bad month, something good will come from t his bad month. She then uses another old expression, “It's no use crying ov er spilled milk.” “It's no use” means it's no good, it doesn't help you, “crying ov er spilled milk.” “To cry over something” is to cry because of something. “Milk” is what you get from, say, a cow, that you drink. I have milk every morning with  my cereal. “Spilled” means that the milk was in a glass, for example, and you hit the glass and the milk fell on the ground. That would be “spilled milk.” You sp illed it. The expression, putting all these things together, “It's no use cry ing over spilled milk,” means it doesn't help worrying about something that already happened. You can't go back and change it. You can't go back and do something d ifferent. That's not possible. You can't change history. So, you just have to worr y about the future.

Porter says, “Spare me your platitudes and let me w allow in my own misery.” “Spare (spare) me” means stop doing something, or m ore typically, stop giving me this information. Stop talking to me about what you are talking about. I don't want to hear it anymore. It's uninteresting, or it' s boring, or I disagree with it. Spare me your lecture. Spare me your advice. I don' t want to hear it.

Porter says, “Spare me your platitudes.” A “platitu de” (platitude) is an expression or a statement that is very common, that everyone s ays, and it's no longer very interesting. It's like saying, “Today is the first day of the rest of your life.” Today is the day that you will continue living. Well, yes th at's true, but it's really not very interesting. That would be a platitude. Another wor d for platitude is a “cliché (cliché). A “cliché” is an expression that everyone  uses so that it doesn't really mean anything anymore.

Porter says to Eleanor, “Let me wallow in my own mi sery.” “To wallow” (wallow) means to enjoy being sad, usually because you're tr ying to get sympathy or

attention from other people. “He wallowed in his sa dness.” He sat there looking sad but in a way hoping other people would notice h e was looking sad so they would pay attention to him. Porter says, “Let me wa llow in my own misery.” “Misery (misery) is suffering, sadness, often becau se you are sick or you don't have enough money.

Eleanor says, “I can't do that. If your work isn't going well, then practice makes perfect.” That's another old expression. “Practice makes perfect” means that if you do something enough times, you will get better at it. You will get perfect at it. Eleanor says, “You'll just do better next time.” Po rter then says, “It's not my work.” He’s not sad because of his work. Eleanor sa ys, “Is it your girlfriend? If your girlfriend isn't being nice to you, then there  are plenty of fish in the sea.” The expression, “There are plenty of fish in the sea (s ea)” is used to tell men and women who are single, who perhaps don't have a boyf riend or a girlfriend, or who have one that isn't very good, that there are other  men and women out there, that you don't have to just stay with this person, that there are many different fish in the sea. There are many different men and women tha t you can go out and find and date.

Eleanor says, “Don't you see? Whatever the problem is, it's not the end of the world.” “The end of the world” is a phrase used to mean the worst possible thing that can happen. But Eleanor says, “It's not the en d of the world.” It's a bad thing, but it's not the worst possible thing that can happ en. Porter says, “My biggest problem right now is easy to fix.” “Easy to fix” me ans easy to solve. Eleanor says, “How?” And then we hear the door slam. This is Port er walking away from Eleanor and slamming the door. When you “slam (slam ) the door,” you close it very loudly so that it makes a loud noise. Usually,  we do this when were angry at someone, or when we’re trying to get away from some one, and Porter, I guess, is trying to get away from Eleanor

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
