# War-Related Disabilities

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 6 46: War-Related Disabilities.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 646.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can download a Learning Guide there that will help you improve your English even faster than not downl oading the Learning Guide.

This episode is called “War-Related Disabilities.”  “Abil ities” are things that you are able or can do; “disabilities” are things that you ca nnot do.  War-related disabilities are usually injuries, something that happen s to your body that damages it – that hurts it somehow.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Elena:  How do you like your new job at the Veteran’s H ospital?

Wieland:  I like it a lot.  It’s really rewarding.

Elena:  What do you do there, exactly?

Wieland:  My job is to help returning vets who have bee n physically injured adjust to living with their medical disabilities.

Elena:  You mean people who have lost limbs?

Wieland:  Yes, some of the vets have had one or more li mbs amputated.  But that’s only one of the many disabilities we see at the h ospital.  For instance, this week I’m working with a vet who suffered serious hearing  loss and a woman who has developed a visual impairment.

Elena:  It sounds like a very hard job.

Wieland:  It can be, but it’s also inspiring sometimes.  I’ve seen people who are paralyzed – paraplegics and quadriplegics – overcome their disabilities and lead full and happy lives.  With the help of wheelchairs, pro sthetic limbs, seeing-eye

 dogs, and modified cars, a lot of people with disabilit ies can learn to be independent.  That’s part of my job.

Elena:  Then you’re just the person I need to help my b rother.

Wieland:  Is he disabled?

Elena:  Yes, he has a serious case of paralysis, cause by extr eme laziness.  Is there any help for him?

Elena begins our dialogue by asking Wieland, “How do you  like your new job at the Veteran’s Hospital?”  A “veteran” (veteran) is a per son who has been in the military, usually during a war.  A person who is no long er in the military, in the army or navy for example, but they used to be; they were in military service.  My father was a veteran.  He was in the U.S. Army during W orld War II.  A “veteran” can also be a more general term to refer to someone wh o has been through some difficult experience or in an organization that had  problems and this person has a lot of experience.  Or it can just mean someone wh o’s very experienced in what they do.  “She’s a veteran news reporter,” meaning  she has a lot of experience; she’s been doing it for many years.  Here, ho wever, “veteran” means someone was in the military.  The U.S. government has sp ecial hospitals for veterans, especially those who are coming back from war who are injured, who perhaps have lost their legs or one of their arms.  We ca ll these veteran’s hospitals.  There’s one here in Los Angeles; there’s one in almost every big city in the United States, and they are operated by the U. S. government.

Wieland says, “I like it a lot (I like my job).  It’s real ly rewarding.”  Something that is “rewarding” is something that gives you a sense of sati sfaction, that makes you feel this is worthwhile.  Certainly for me, recording t hese podcasts is very rewarding.  Elena says, “What do you do there, exactly?”  What kind of work do you do at the hospital?  Wieland says, “My job is to help  returning vets who have been physically injured adjust to living with their medica l disabilities.”  Lots of terms there; let’s start with “returning vet.”  A “retu rning vet” is a returning veteran; “vet” is short for veteran.  This is a person who is coming back from a war zone, or from a place where they were stationed – where they were working. They’re coming back to the United States; they’re return ing, and hence – therefore we have the term “returning vets.”  “Vet” (ve t) actually has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.

 These returning vets have been “physically injured.”  “Physica lly” refers to your body, things that you can feel and see.  “Injured” is the same as hurt or broken. If you injured your foot it hurts; you did something to  it that has damaged it somehow.  “To adjust” means to adapt to something, to  go from one situation to another situation – “to adjust to.”  “Medical” refers t o medicine, things that are used to help you get better.  A “disability” is something  that you cannot do.  Here, it means some typically part of your body that isn’t working  the way it should, or perhaps you’ve lost a leg or you’ve lost a finger; you have  a medical disability. Why do we say “medical disability,” since we are talking ab out the body?  Well, it’s possible to have other disabilities.  In school, someti mes we talk about “learning disabilities,” things that are related to the way you learn, things that you perhaps have difficulty with.  Here, it refers to injur ies – physical injuries to the body.

Wieland says, “My job is to help returning vets who have b een physically injured adjust to living with their medical disabilities.”  Elen a says, “You mean people who have lost limbs?”  A “limb” (limb – the “b” is silen t, we don’t pronounce it) is either an arm or a leg.  You have four limbs: two arm s and two legs.  Wieland says, “Yes, some of the vets (some of the veterans) have had  one or more limbs amputated.”  “To amputate” (amputate) means to remove  either an arm or a leg or possibly a finger or toe.  To physically remove it from your body, we would say to remove it surgically.  You have a special doctor called  a “surgeon,” who is responsible for things like “amputations,” which is the n oun.  So yes, some of the vets have had limbs amputate.  We call someone who has a limb amputated an “amputee,” that’s a person who has had a limb amputate d.  Wieland says, “But that’s only one of the many disabilities we see at the h ospital.  For instance, this week I’m working with a vet who suffered serious hearing  loss and a woman who has developed a visual impairment.”  “Hearing loss” is whe n you are unable to hear very well.  There could be a lot of causes for tha t.  “Visual” refers to your eyes, what you can see.  An “impairment” is something simi lar to a disability; it’s something that you cannot do or cannot do very well.  A “visual impairment” is when you can’t see very well.

Elena says, “It sounds like a very hard job (a very difficul t job).”  Wieland says, “It can be, but it’s also inspiring sometimes.”  “Inspiring” m eans motivating, making you believe that anything is possible, making you want to t ry harder.  Wieland says that he’s seen people who are paralyzed – paraplegics and quadriplegics – overcome their disabilities and lead full and happy lives.   “To be paralyzed” means to be unable to move some part of your body, usua lly because there’s some medical problem.  We also have an expression “to be p aralyzed with fear,” meaning you’re so afraid that you can’t move.  But normally, “paralyzed” is a medical condition – a disability.  There are two common types of paralyzed

 conditions.  One of them is to have no ability to use your  legs; from your waist down you can’t move your body.  We call someone who has t hat condition a “paraplegic” (paraplegic).  That’s from the waist down,  the bottom half of your body.  If you can move the top or the bottom half of you r body we would call you a “quadriplegic.”  This is someone paralyzed we would say from the neck down, meaning anything below their neck.  You can move your hea d perhaps, but not anything else.  Unfortunately that happens sometimes whe n people have serious injuries; it could be in war, it could even in a car acci dent.

Wieland says that the patients, the people at the hospit al, often overcome their disabilities.  They are able to go beyond them and lea d, or have, full and happy lives.  “With the help of wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, seeing-eye dogs, and modified cars, a lot of people with disabilities can lea rn to be independent.”  A “wheelchair” (one word) is a special chair that has whee ls on it so that a person who cannot walk can be moved or move him or herself.  “P rosthetic limbs” are man-made or artificial limbs: a leg or an arm for peo ple who have lost their leg or arm.  “Seeing-eye dogs” are specially trained dogs that  help blind people – people who cannot see – in their daily activities.  The y help them walk, move from one place to another.  Finally, a “modified car” is a car that has been changed; we might also say “altered” so that someone who  has a disability can use it.

Elena says, “Then you’re just the person I need to help m y brother.”  Wieland says, “Is he disabled?”  Elena says, “Yes, he has a serious case  of paralysis, cause by extreme laziness.  Is there any help for him?”  Rem ember we talked about being paralyzed with fear.  Well, Elena says that her brother is paralyzed because he’s extremely lazy, he won’t get up and move.  Of  course, she’s making a joke here.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
