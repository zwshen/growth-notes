<P>
You, as a member of a development team for a new spell checking program, are to write a module that will check the
correctness of given words using a known dictionary of all correct words in all their forms.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
If the word is absent in the dictionary then it can be replaced by correct words (from the dictionary) that can be obtained by
one of the following operations:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>deleting of one letter from the word;

<P>
<LI>replacing of one letter in the word with an arbitrary letter;

<P>
<LI>inserting of one arbitrary letter into the word.
</UL>

<P>
Your task is to write the program that will find all possible replacements from the dictionary for every given word.

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

The first line of the input is an integer N, then a blank line followed by N datasets. There is a blank line between datasets.

<p>The first part of each dataset contains all words from the dictionary. Each word occupies its own line. This part is finished by
the single character `<TT>#</TT>' on a separate line. All words are different.
There will be at most 10000 words in the dictionary.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The next part of the dataset contains all words that are to be checked. Each word occupies its own line. This part is also finished by
the single character `<TT>#</TT>' on a separate line. There will be at most 50 words that are to be checked.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
All words in the input file (words from the dictionary and words to be checked) consist only of small alphabetic characters and
each one contains 15 characters at most.

<P>

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For each dataset, write exactly one line for every checked word in the order of their appearance in the second part of the input
file. If the word is correct (i.e. it exists in the dictionary) write the 
message: ``
<!-- MATH: $<checked word>$ -->
&lt;<I>checked word</I>&gt;<TT> is correct</TT>". If the word is not
correct then write this word first, then write the character `<TT>:</TT>' (colon),
and after a single space write all its possible replacements, separated by
spaces. The replacements should be written in the order of their appearance in
the dictionary (in the first part of the input file). If there are no
replacements for this word then the line feed should immediately follow the
colon.

<p>Print a blank line between datasets.
