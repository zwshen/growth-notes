This episode is called “Describing Fabric Patterns.”  “Fabr ic” is what you use to make clothing or to put on a couch.  “Pattern,” here, r efers to the design, so we’re going to be talking about common designs that you would  see on fabric for something such as a chair or a couch.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ruth:  Now that we’ve picked out a new couch, we need to  pick out an upholstery fabric.  What do you think of this checkered one?

Gerry:  That’s an eyesore.  I prefer something a little more subtle.

Ruth:  Subtle?  What’s fun about subtle?  I want some thing bold and that’ll make a statement.  How about this one with the polka dots?

Gerry:  You’ve got to be kidding!  That pattern is so bu sy, if I had to look at that every day, I’d go crazy.

Ruth:  All right, what do you think of this one with t he stripes?

Gerry:  I’m not crazy about it, but it’s not as tacky as the  others ones.

Ruth:  Okay then, you pick one out.

Gerry:  Fine.  Let me see…Now this is a sight for sore eyes!

Ruth:  But that has no pattern at all!  It’s a solid b lue color, and a boring shade of blue to boot.

 Gerry:  That’s right.  That’s what I call a classic.

Ruth:  And that’s what I call dull!

Our dialogue between Ruth and Gerry begins with Ruth saying, “Now that we’ve picked out a new couch, we need to pick out an upholstery fabric.”  “To pick out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to select, to choose.  “I need to go pick out a new shirt at the store,” I need to find a shirt, select  one to buy.  Ruth and Gerry have picked out a new couch (a new sofa).  Now, they need  to pick out an upholstery fabric.  “Fabric” is soft material, usually ma de from cotton, wool, silk, other things, that is used to cover something; it can be u sed to make clothing as well.  In this case, they’re buying fabric for upholstery.  “Upholstery” (upholstery) is specifically the material that is used to cover furnitur e, such as chairs and sofas, couches – that sort of thing.

Ruth says, “What do you think of this checkered one?”  She’ s showing him a sample of this upholstery fabric.  Something that is “check ered” is basically a grid-like pattern, where you have vertical and horizont al lines crossing each other at regular intervals (at regular distances), so that you end up with these little squares.  We talk about the game of checkers; that’s a che ckered pattern on the actual board itself, where you have horizontal and verti cal lines crossing.  There could also be different colors inside of the squares, as is the case on a checkerboard.

Well, Gerry doesn’t like the pattern; he says, “That’s an eyesore (eyesore – one word).”  An “eyesore” means something is very ugly, somethi ng that is painful to look at, something that is very unpleasant.  It’s a very insu lting, negative way of describing something.  Gerry says, “I prefer something a l ittle more subtle.”  “To be subtle” (subtle) means that it’s not as easily noticed; “subtle” can also mean not drawing to attention to yourself, meaning you’re not trying to get other people to look at you.  “Subtle” can be used in many different ways.  Here it’s used as a description of a pattern, a pattern that is visually subtl e, meaning you can see the differences in the pattern but they aren’t as bold – t hey aren’t as strong as, for example, in a checkered pattern, where the pattern is ver y obvious.

Ruth says, “Subtle?  What’s fun about subtle?  I want som ething bold that makes a statement.”  “Bold,” as I mentioned, is strong, brigh t, something that attracts your attention, something you notice easily.  She wants a fabric pattern that makes a statement.  The expression “to make a statement” me ans that you are doing something that is different, that is interesting,  that is unique, but you are

 doing it in such a way that you want other people to n otice.  Maybe you’re trying to communicate some idea, but rather than saying it you d o something to make a statement.  That’s what she’s trying to do with her fabr ic.  I’m not sure to whom she’s making the statement, but she wants to make a stateme nt, Ruth does! Ruth says, “How about this one with the polka dots (polka  dots – two words)?”  A “polka dot” is a design with many small circles.  It’s usual ly, in most cases, considered a very bold, a very dramatic kind of pattern.  Most people kind of make fun of polka dot patterns nowadays; it seems very ol d-fashion to us.  You might wear a polka dot pattern as a joke, for example,  but you don’t see it very often.

Gerry says, “You’ve got to be kidding (meaning you must be joking – you’re joking)!  That pattern is so busy, if I had to look at th at every day, I’d go crazy.” The “pattern,” we’ve already explained, is the design, u sually a repeating design on something.  “Busy,” when we’re talking about a visual pattern (the ways something looks), means that there are a lot of small th ings to look at, so that your eyes don’t quite know what to focus on.  Something that would be “busy” would be something that would have too many small detai ls.  “Busy,” however, has a couple of different meanings in English; you can fi nd those in our Learning Guide.

Gerry thinks that the polka dot pattern is too busy.  He sa ys if he had to look at it every day, he’d go crazy (he’d go mad).  Ruth says, “All rig ht, what do you think of this one with the stripes?”  A “stripe” is a thick line ; it’s a design that has many horizontal lines or vertical lines, but not both.  If it  had both, that would be a checkered pattern.  You often will see businesspeople dre ssed in very nice suits, and sometimes they are what are called “pinstripe.”  The re’s a thin line pattern on the fabric.

Gerry says, “I’m not crazy about that pattern.”  “To be cr azy about (something),” in this case, means to be very excited and interested in some thing, something that you like a lot.  He says he’s not crazy about it, “but  it’s not as tacky as the others ones.”  The adjective “tacky” (tacky) means unattractive,  inappropriate, showing very poor taste, showing that you’re not very good at knowing what is attractive and appropriate for a place.  So, he’s saying this one is not as tacky as the other ones, meaning the other ones are very tacky.  “ Tacky” is a very negative way of describing something.

Ruth says, “Okay then, you pick one out (you select one).”  G erry says, “Fine. Let me see…Now this is a sight for sore eyes!”  He picks up on e of the patterns and says it’s a sight for sore (sore) eyes.  “A sight for so re eyes” is something that is very pretty, very attractive, especially after you’ve be en looking at ugly

 things for a long time.  “Sore” would be hurt, used t oo often.  If you have sore eyes, you’ve been looking at too many things; in this case, too many ugly things. However, this expression is often used sarcastically.  If some one comes in and they’re all dirty, they may be described as “a sight for so re eyes” meaning that as a joke.  Meaning they’re, in fact, not a good sight for  sore eyes because they’re also ugly.  But here, he means it in the original sense of something that is pretty and attractive.

Ruth says, “But that has no pattern at all!  It’s a soli d blue color, with a boring shade of blue to boot.”  Something that is “solid,” wh en it comes to design, is only one color; it has no design or pattern.  You would say, “It’s a solid green,” that implies (that means) there is no pattern to it; it’s ju st the color green.  Ruth says that not only is it a solid blue color, it also has a bor ing shade of blue to boot.  A “shade” of a color is a type of a color.  You can have re d, or dark red, or light red; those are different shades, or “hues” (hue) is another w ord we use.  “To boot,” in this case, means in addition to.  It’s a phrase we use to emphasize the last thing that you said.  I once had a girlfriend who said, “Jeff , you’re ugly, you’re poor, and you’re stupid to boot!”  Oh, no, wait a minute.  That wasn’t me, that was Brad Pitt I think they said that about!  “Boot” has several me anings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Ruth doesn’t like this solid blue color.  Gerry says it may be a boring shade of blue but it’s a “classic,” meaning it’s something that ever yone recognizes as high quality.  Ruth says, “And that’s what I call dull!”  Som ething that is “dull” (dull) is uninteresting, not very exciting – sort of like my life, kin d of dull!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
