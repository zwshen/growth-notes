This episode is about doubting one’s language use, especially when you’re speaking another language, which, of course, most o f you are.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Flora:  Can you help me?  I’m working on this email  to Emil and I’m having trouble coming up with the right words in French.

Andy:  My French isn’t much better than yours, but I’ll give it a shot.

Flora:  Okay, read this sentence for me.  What I wa nt to know is if that is a suitable way to say that I’m sick, but that I’m not  seriously ill.

Andy:  Word choice can be tricky, but I think that’ s the appropriate word, with the right meaning and the right connotations.

Flora:  Okay, now read this sentence.  It doesn’t s ound right to me.  Is this the right usage of the word “ faire ”?  I really doubt it.

Andy:  That’s because you’re using the wrong form o f the verb, I think.  Now if only I can think of the correct form.  My French is  really, really rusty.

Flora:  Now that you’ve pointed out the problem, I can look it up later.  What about this paragraph?  The last sentence sounds awk ward to me.

Andy:  It sounds okay to me, but then again, I’m no t a native speaker.

Flora:  Ugh, this is so frustrating!  It’s such a p roduction every time I write him an email.

Andy:  Maybe Emil will learn English and your troub les will be over.

Flora:  Yes and maybe monkeys will fly out of my bu tt!

Our dialogue begins with Flora saying to Andy, “Can  you help me?  I’m working on this email to Emil and I’m having trouble coming  up with the right words in French.”  “To come up with (something)” is a phrasa l verb meaning to think of something, to have an idea for something or an idea  about something: “I have to come up with a title for this episode.”  I have to invent one; I have to think of one; I have to create one.  Flora is having difficulty c oming up with or thinking of the right or correct words in French for an email she’s  writing in French.

Andy says, “My French isn’t much better than yours, ” meaning my knowledge of French, or my French fluency or proficiency isn’t m uch better than yours.  He says, “I’ll give it a shot.”  “To give (something) a shot” (shot) means you’ll try something even when you don’t think you will be suc cessful, usually because it’s very difficult.  “I’m not very good at fixing cars,  but I’ll give it a shot.”  I’ll try; I don’t expect I will be successful.  Andy is going to give  it a shot, going to give helping Flora in her French email a shot.

Flora says, “Okay, read this sentence for me.  What  I want to know is if that is a suitable way to say that I’m sick, but that I’m not  seriously ill.”  A “suitable” (suitable) way is an appropriate way, an acceptable  way, something that is okay to do in a particular situation.  Flora wants to kn ow if she’s using the right word to say that she’s sick, but not seriously sick.

Andy says, “Word choice can be tricky.”  “Word choi ce” is picking the right word to say exactly what you want to say.  “Tricky” (tri cky) here means difficult or challenging, something that is easy to make a mista ke at.  So, it can be difficult to pick the right word.  Andy says, “Word choice can b e tricky, but I think that’s the appropriate word, with the right meaning and the ri ght connotations.” “Appropriate” here means the same as suitable; it’s  something that is acceptable; it is right for this situation.  Andy thinks she ha s the right word; it has the right “meaning” – the right definition, if you will, and the right connotations.  A “connotation” (connotation) is an additional meanin g to a word or a phrase; it is the ideas that you think of when you hear that word  and phrase even if it isn’t the actual definition that you would find in a dictiona ry.  We have something called

the “denotation,” that’s the definition that you wi ll see in a dictionary.  The “connotation” are all the other meanings that are a ssociated with that word or things that you think of when you hear that word.  For example, the word “stubborn” means the same as “strong-willed.”  It’s  someone who doesn’t change their mind, someone who will do what they want to d o even if other people disagree with them.  However, the connotations of s tubborn are negative.  If you say someone is stubborn, that’s a criticism.  If yo u say someone is strong-willed, that is a compliment usually; it means that they ar e a strong person, a good thing.  So the connotations are different, even tho ugh the denotations are similar.

Andy thinks this word that Flora chose is the right  word.  I’m not sure what word it is.  Je ne sais pas , as we say in French.  That means, I think, I don’ t know.  I’m not sure, I don’t know!  Anyway, Flora then says, “ Okay, now read this sentence. It doesn’t sound right to me.”  When we say somethi ng doesn’t “sound right” we mean that it might be grammatically correct but it isn’t the exact meaning you want or it isn’t what people would normally say in this situation.  Flora says, “Is this the right usage of the word ‘ faire ’?  I really doubt it.”  “Usage” (usage) is the way that a word or phrase is used.  The correct gra mmatical way that you use a word as well as the correct meaning, that’s usage.  Flora is asking about how the verb “ faire ” in French is used.  Flora says that she doubts th at she is using it correctly.  “To doubt” means that you are not sure about something.

Andy says, “That’s because you’re using the wrong f orm of the verb, I think.” “Form” here refers to the correct conjugation of the verb; is it for “I” or “you” or “they,” that sort of thing.  “Form” has many meanin gs in English, of course. Some of those can be found in our Learning Guide for this episode.  Andy says, “Now if only I can think of the correct form.”  He means he doesn’t know what it is, but he’s trying to think of it right now: “If o nly I can think of the correct form.” He says, “My French is really, really rusty (rusty) .”  “Rusty” is a way of saying that it isn’t as strong as it used to be; I haven’t prac ticed it; I haven’t used it.  You can say this about anything; you could say, “Oh, I used  to be a very good tennis player, but now I’m little rusty.”  “Rust” (rust) i s what happens when you have metal changing because of water and air and other t hings that change the outside of the metal; often it becomes a reddish co lor.  But in the sentence, “rusty,” as an adjective, is used to mean something  that you used to do well but don’t do very well anymore.

Flora says, “Now that you’ve pointed out the proble m (now that you’ve told me what’s wrong), I can look it up later.”  “To look ( something) up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to search for it.  We used to search for it in books, dictionaries, grammar books.  Nowadays, people sear ch for it on the Internet, they Google it.  That’s how we look things up nowad ays, how we research, how

we investigate something to find an answer.  Flora says, “What about this paragraph?  The last sentence sounds awkward to me. ”  The verb “to sound” here is normally for something to make a noise, lik e “the bell sounds” or “the alarm sounds.”  But here, it means seems: “The last  sentence seems to me to be awkward.”  It appears to me; that’s the way I’m rea ding it; that’s my interpretation; it seems to me the last sentence sounds awkward.  “ Awkward” (awkward) means that it isn’t quite right.  It’s often used to desc ribe something that’s difficult to do, or someone who is in a tough position or an uncomfo rtable position.  Here, when we say it sounds awkward, we mean it doesn’t sound correct.

Andy says, “It sounds okay to me, but then again, I ’m not a native speaker.” “Then again” means on the other hand: “However, I’m  not a native speaker.”  A “native speaker” is someone who grew up, usually fr om the time they were a small baby, hearing and speaking the language.

Flora says, “Ugh, this is so frustrating!  It’s suc h a production every time I write him an email.”  “Production” here means something t hat requires a lot of work. Andy says, “Maybe Emil will learn English and your troubles will be over.”  When we say someone’s troubles will be over, we mean tha t sometime in the future, we’re not sure when, they will no longer have this problem.  Flora says, “Yes and maybe monkeys will fly out of my butt!”  Well, your  “butt,” you probably know, (butt) is what you sit on.  This is a very informal  phrase that comes from a movie in the 1990s called Wayne’s World  in English.  It was a movie with Mike Myers. Anyway, in the movie they’re talking about somethin g that seems very impossible, something that would be almost impossib le to happen.  For example, you might say, “Well, maybe you will become Preside nt of the United States,” which doesn’t seem very likely, and you can reply, “Well, yeah.  Maybe monkeys will fly out of my butt!”  Of course, monkeys don’t  fly, and they certainly don’t fly out of your butt!  It’s a funny phrase.  The old ph rase was “when pigs fly.”  “When pigs fly” is meant to indicate an impossible condit ion.  Pigs, of course, don’t fly, and so it will never happen.  So, it’s another way of saying that will never happen. Do not use this with your boss!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
