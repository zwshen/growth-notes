This episode is a dialogue between Susan and Jack a bout drinking and driving – never a good idea. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Susan: Hey, Jack, you’re an attorney. Do you know a nything about DUIs? 

Jack: Sure, I’ve handled a few DUI cases.  

Susan: I was just wondering about the penalties for  a DUI.  

Jack: Well, if it’s a first offense, you’ll be fine d and may be placed on probation. You’ll need to attend DUI school, and your license will be restricted, which means you can only drive to and from work and to and from  DUI school. 

Susan: That sounds serious, but what if it’s not yo ur first offense? 

Jack: Then the penalties get even more serious. Wit h your second offense, you’ll probably do mandatory jail time, anywhere from 96 h ours to a year, depending on the circumstances. Your driver’s license will be  suspended, and you’ll be placed on probation for several years. 

Susan: Those are some severe penalties. But what if  you already have two DUIs? 

Jack: Then you’ll get several months in jail, at le ast. Your license will be revoked and you may be required to go into an alcohol treat ment program. Why are you asking me all of these questions? You’re not in tro uble, are you? 

Susan: No, I’m not. I just met a guy and I really l ike him, but I think he just got his third DUI. 

Jack: If that isn’t deterrent enough, you may think  about what kind of relationship you can have with him – from behind bars!

This dialogue is between Susan and Jack. Susan says  to Jack, “Hey Jack, you’re an attorney. Do you know anything about DUIs?” Noti ce, Susan appears to be a friend of Jack, because she says, “Hey.” That would  be a word we would use with a friend or someone we know well.  

Susan says to Jack, “You’re an attorney.” An “attor ney” (attorney) is a lawyer – someone who studies the laws of a particular state or country and often represents other people in legal actions. If you ar e arrested by the police, you will probably want to get an attorney. In the United Sta tes, if you don’t have money for an attorney, the government will pay for an att orney for you, although it won’t necessarily be the best attorney – but you will get  someone.  

In our story, Jack is an attorney, and Susan is ask ing him if he knows anything about DUIs. A “DUI” is when you are arrested for dr iving under the influence. The “I” in DUI stands for “influence,” and that means t hat you are affected by something. What are you affected by? Well, usually alcohol. So, “driving under the influence” means driving under the influence of  alcohol – driving while you have alcohol “in your system,” we would say – in yo ur body – and it is affecting how you drive.  

Obviously, if you drink too much, you get drunk, an d then you aren’t able to drive as well as people who are not drinking, or at least  as well as most people who are not drinking. DUIs, then, are offenses – things  you can get arrested for. In the United States, it’s a very serious offense nowadays . In the last, oh, maybe 30 to 40 years, the laws have become much tougher on peop le who drink and drive at the same time. Definitely not something you want to  do, not just for legal reasons, but for safety reasons as well.  

Jack says to Susan, “Sure, I’ve handled a few DUI c ases.” “To handle” (handle) as a verb means to be responsible for – to take car e of or to manage something.  

Here it means to have participated in and taken car e of or been responsible for something. A “case” (case) here refers to a legal p rocess or legal matter – something involving the law. Jack says he’s “handle d a few DUI cases” – that is, legal matters that involve people who were arrested  for driving under the influence.  

Susan says, “I was just wondering about the penalti es for a DUI.” A “penalty” (penalty) is a punishment for breaking some rule or  some law. Jack says, “Well, if it’s a first offense, you’ll be fined and maybe pla ced on probation.” A “first offense” is the first time that you break a law. An  “offense” (offense) is when you do something wrong, something, in this case, illega l. So, a first offense would be the first time that you broke this law.  

I should mention that the laws regarding DUIs relat e not just to people who are drinking, but also people who are taking any sort o f drug that would affect their ability to drive properly. If you’ve been drinking and driving, the police will measure your blood alcohol level – the amount of al cohol in your body – and if it is more than the acceptable amount, you will almost  certainly be arrested (taken in by the police) or at the very least you will be given a ticket – a notification that you have broken the law – and have to pay some sort  of penalty or be punished somehow. 

One way that you can be punished is to be fined. “T o be fined” (fined) means to have to pay money to the government or some officia l organization for something you did wrong. The fines, which is the amount of mo ney you have to pay for a DUI, can be quite high – hundreds or perhaps even t housands of dollars.  

Jack says, “You may also be placed on probation” (p robation). “To be placed on probation” means to be told that you can’t commit a ny more crimes or any similar crime for a certain amount of time. The reason peop le are placed on probation is to prevent them from committing the crime again, an d if they do, then they will be punished even more. So, if you are on probation for  six months or one year and you are arrested again for a DUI, your punishment w ill be much more severe. It will be much greater than if you were not on probat ion.  

Usually when someone is arrested for something seri ous, after they are released from prison they are on probation – they have to ba sically not break any laws for a certain amount of time, and if they do, they can sometimes be sent back to prison. Jack says, “You’ll need to attend DUI schoo l, and your license will be restricted, which means you can only drive to and f rom work and to and from DUI school.” “DUI school” is basically an educational p rogram you have to undertake, you have to participate in, that reminds you of the  laws of driving.   

 “To have your license” – your driver’s license or p ermission – “restricted” means that you can only drive certain places or under cer tain circumstances. So, you can’t drive around the city just because you want t o. You can only drive from your house to your work, for example. That would be one possible restriction on your driving privileges or driving abilities.  

Susan says, “That sounds serious, but what if it’s not your first offense?” Susan wants to know what if you have broken the law more than once. Jack explains, “Then the penalties get even more serious. With you r second offense, you’ll probably do mandatory jail time.” A “jail” (jail) i s the same as a prison. “Jail time” means spending time in prison. “Mandatory” (mandato ry) means it’s required. It’s not voluntary or optional. You have to do it.  

How much time will you have to spend in prison? Wel l, it depends on the state in which you live. In our dialogue, Jack says it can b e anywhere from 96 hours to a year, depending on the circumstances. “Your driver’ s license will be suspended,” Jack says, “and you’ll be placed on probation for s everal years.” Your “driver’s license,” as we explained, is your permission to dr ive. If your license is “suspended,” you can no longer drive. You have to w ait until your period of punishment is over, which could be several years.  

Susan says, “Those are some severe penalties.” “Sev ere” (severe) means very strict or very serious. “Severe” refers to a situat ion that is very extreme in some negative way. Susan says, “But what if you already have two DUIs?” What if you been arrested twice for drunk driving or driving un der the influence? Jack says, “Then you’ll get several months in jail, at least,”  meaning at minimum. “Your license will be revoked and you may be required to go into an alcohol treatment program.”  

If your license is “revoked” (revoked), it is taken  away from you completely. Notice that you can have your license “suspended,” which means you can’t use it for a certain amount of time, or you could have you r license “revoked,” which means you lose your license completely, and often y ou won’t be able to get another license. An “alcohol treatment program” is a program that helps you get over your problems with drinking. You could also go  into a “drug treatment program” if your problem is with some other sort of  drug.  

Jack says, “Why are you asking me all of these ques tions? You’re not in trouble, are you?” Susan says, “No, I’m not. I just met a gu y and I really like him, but I think he just got his third DUI.” So, Susan has met  some gentleman in whom she’s interested romantically, but this gentleman h as three DUIs.   

 Jack says, “If that isn’t deterrent enough, you may  think about what kind of relationship you can have with him from behind bars .” A “deterrent” (deterrent) is something that discourages you from doing something  – something that would prevent you from doing something or give you a good  reason not to do something. Jack is saying that the fact that this m an that Susan is interested in has three DUIs should be a deterrent to her. It sho uld prevent her or discourage her from forming a romantic relationship with him.  

The reason Jack says this is because it would be, f or one thing, difficult to have such a relationship if a man is in prison. The expr ession “from behind bars” (bars) refers to being in prison. The “bar” here isn’t a p lace where you go to drink. The “bars” are metal rods or sticks that are placed on the windows of a prison to prevent people from leaving the prison.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
