Walt:  It’s the off-season, so I can understand him  wanting to blow off some steam. But doesn’t he realize what he’s doing to hi s image and reputation?

Connie:  They don’t call him the bad boy of basketb all for nothing. I guess it’s our job to do some damage control.

Walt:  Not as long as Ron’s.

Our dialogue begins with Connie saying, “I just got  a call,” meaning I just received a telephone call, “from Ron’s agent.” An “ agent” (agent) is a representative, a person whose job it is to represe nt usually an athlete (that is, a sports player), a musician, a model, an actor, a wr iter. Many of these people have agents. They're sort of business people who re present them, who take care of their business negotiations and business contrac ts for them. Connie says, “He’s in hot water again,” meaning Ron is in hot wa ter. “To be in hot water” means to be in trouble, to have a lot of difficulti es, to have done something wrong and now you have problems.

Walt says, “Not again! What did he get up to now?” The expression “to get up to something” is a phrasal verb meaning to become invo lved in something, usually something bad, something that you should not be doi ng. “What did he get up to now?” Well, Connie says that he, Ron, got into anot her fight outside of a bar. A “fight” is when you hit someone else. A bar, of cou rse, is a place where people drink alcohol, so it's not surprising that there are fights outside of bars and that’s what happened to Ron. Now Connie says, “He’s in pol ice custody.” To be in “police custody” (custody) means that the police ca me and they arrested you. They are holding you. They won't let you go. Usuall y, they take you to a jail or to what we would call a “police station.” If you get i n trouble, that can happen to you. And that’s what happened to Ron.

Connie says, “He’s in police custody right now cool ing his heels.” This expression to “cool (cool) your heels” (heels) means to spend time calming down. When you're very angry or very emotional, someone might say to you, “You need to cool your heels.” Your “heel” is the part of your f oot, the bottom, back part of your foot, but the expression “to cool your heels” perha ps means that you need to be running around less. In any case, it means that you  need to calm down. You need to be less angry, less emotional. Connie says,  “I don’t know what he was thinking,” meaning I'm not sure why he did this.

Walt says, “It’s the off-season.” The “off-season” is when a sport is not being played. For example, baseball is played between, sa y, April and October. That means that November, December, January, February, t he first part of March, that’s the off-season. That’s when there isn't any professional baseball games or there aren't any professional baseball games. That’ s the off-season. Walt says, “It's the off-season, so I can understand him wanti ng to blow off some steam.” The expression “to blow off some steam” (steam) mea ns to release negative emotions or extra energy or stress in some way. Let 's say you come home from work and you had a bad day, a very stressful day, s o you decide to go for a run. You're going to jog around your neighborhood in ord er to relax, to blow off some steam. That’s the idea.

 Walt says, “Doesn’t he, Ron, realize that what he’s  doing to his image and reputation?” Walt is asking why Ron is doing these crazy things like getting involved in a fight outside of a bar and then getti ng arrested or taken by the police. He asked whether Ron realizes what all of t his is doing to his image. Your “image” (image) is the way other people look at you . It's the way other people see you. Reputation is very closely related to that. Th at’s what other people think about you. Your reputation is what other people thi nk. You may have a reputation for being a funny person. That means other people, when they think of you, think, “Oh yeah, he’s funny.” We want to have a good reput ation, of course, and not a bad reputation, but Ron is getting a bad reputation  by doing all of these stupid things. But sometimes professional athletes do stup id things.

Connie says, “They call him the bad boy of basketba ll for nothing.” This phrase “they don’t call someone something for nothing” is used to emphasize that someone has earned or deserves the image and reputa tion that they have. So, for example, someone may be a very good singer and they stand up and they sing a wonderful song, and you say to your friend, “They don’t call him the best singer in the world for nothing,” meaning there's a  reason why people think he’s a good singer and he just demonstrated it. So, when s omebody does something that shows that whatever their image or reputation is, is true, that is when we would use this expression. So, Ron is known, he has  the reputation, for being the bad boy of basketball. Basketball of course is the sport. To be a “bad boy” means to be a boy or a man who’s actions are often breaki ng the rules, somebody who doesn’t care what other people think of him, somebo dy who does things that are wrong or that are bad.

Connie says, “I guess it's our job to do some damag e control.” “Damage” is when you hurt something. “Damage control” is when there' s a problem or a negative situation and somebody tries to make it so that it isn't as bad as it might be, someone who tries to stop the problem from getting any bigger or any worse. So, let's say we have a famous singer or a famous actor  and they have a drug problem or they get arrested for doing something bad, something wrong, their agents, their representatives will try to do some d amage control. They’ll try to talk to the newspapers and magazines and say, “Well, he was having a bad day” or he’s really sorry about what happened. That’s damag e control. That’s trying to protect and save this person’s reputation from gett ing any worse.

Walt says, “Yeah, and fast,” meaning we need to do some damage control quickly. “Once the press gets a hold of this, they’ ll have a field day.” The expression “to get a hold of something” means to ge t information, to find out about something, to obtain information that might b e difficult to get. The “press”

refers to the media: newspapers, magazines, televis ion reporters, etc. “To have a field day” is an expression meaning to have a lot of fun doing something without any limits or any restrictions. We're going to have  a field day at Starbucks by drinking all the coffee we possibly can. We're goin g to the café and we're going to have a field day. This expression is often used,  as it is in this dialogue, to talk about what will happen if somebody finds out about some secret negative or damaging information. When the television stations find out that Ron had a fight, they’ll have a field day, meaning they’ll really ma ke fun of him. It will be a very damaging time because they found out this informati on.

Connie says, “It's going to be a long night,” meani ng we're going to have to stay up late in order to do this damage control, making phone calls and so forth.

Walt says, “Not as long as Ron’s,” meaning Ron will  have an even more difficult night because of course, he is being held by the po lice.

Connie then says, “Serves him right!” The expressio n “serves him right” or “serves them right” or “serves her right” is used w hen you are expressing your opinion that when something bad happened to someone , they deserved it. It was because they did something wrong that they are gett ing a negative consequence for their behavior or for their actions. So, somebo dy starts drinking and they start driving and then the police stop them and arrest th em. You might say, “Well, serves them right!” meaning, they deserve that beca use they did something bad. They did something wrong.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
