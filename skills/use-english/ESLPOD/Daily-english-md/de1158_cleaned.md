This episode is a dialogue between Boris and Kay ab out being in cold weather and complaining about it – telling people what you don’t like about it. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Boris: Come on, keep climbing! This is the best exe rcise you’ll get all winter. 

Kay: My face hurts and I can’t stop shivering. 

Boris: If we pick up the pace, you’ll warm up. 

Kay: I doubt it. I can feel my core body temperatur e dipping. I feel hypothermia coming on. 

Boris: Don’t be silly. You’re dressed in layers, wi th fabric that wicks moisture away from your skin and insulates your body from th e cold. The worst you’re going to get are dry skin and cracked lips. 

Kay: Then why do I feel pins and needles in my hand s and numbness in my feet? 

Boris: Maybe you’re just getting used to the cold. You’ll feel warmer in a minute. 

Kay: But what if they’re signs of frostbite? I thin k I’ll turn back before I freeze. 

Boris: And miss out on these awe-inspiring winter v iews? 

Kay: I prefer the awe-inspiring views of a blazing fire!

We begin our dialogue with Boris telling Kay, “Come  on, keep climbing!” “To climb” (climb) means to go up, usually a hill or a mountain. Boris says, “This is the best exercise you’ll get all winter.” Boris is telling Kay that climbing – whatever it is they’re climbing, a hill or a rock o r a mountain – is going to be good exercise. Kay says, “My face hurts and I can’t stop  shivering.”  

Kay says her “face hurts.” It’s painful probably be cause it’s so cold out. She says she “can’t stop shivering.” “To shiver” (shiver) me ans to have your body move – or we would say “shake” (shake) – uncontrollably be cause you’re so cold. If you’re really, really cold, sometimes your arms wil l start moving, your body will start moving, because you are so cold. That’s calle d “to shiver.”  

Boris says, “If we pick up the pace, you’ll warm up .” “To pick up the pace” (pace) is an expression meaning to increase your speed, es pecially when you are talking about walking – to walk more quickly. Boris  is telling Kay that if she moves more quickly, she will warm up. She won’t be as col d. “To warm up” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to become warmer.  

Kay doesn’t believe it. She says, “I doubt it,” mea ning I don’t think so. “I can feel my core body temperature dipping.” Your “core (core ) body temperature” refers to how warm or cold the center of your body is. You ’re not talking about how cold your arms and legs are, but rather the middle part of your body, what we might call your “torso” (torso). “To dip” (dip) means to go down. So, if your core body temperature is “dipping,” the temperature is decrea sing. We might also say it’s “dropping.”  

Kay says, “I feel hypothermia coming on.” “Hypother mia” (hypothermia) is when your body is too cold. It gets so cold that you cou ld even die. It’s a condition of the body having too low of a temperature. “To come on” here is another way of saying it is beginning to happen. Kay says she feel s “hypothermia coming on.” Boris says, “Don’t be silly,” meaning you’re wrong;  you’re exaggerating; you’re not being rational.  

He says, “You’re dressed in layers with fabric that  wicks moisture away from your skin and insulates your body from the cold.” If you  are “dressed in layers” (layers), you have different pieces of clothing on,  one over the other, so that you keep warmer. If you live in a cold area, you know t hat a good way of keeping warm is to put different pieces of clothing on your  body – one shirt, and then  

another shirt over that, and then a sweater over th at. This is called “dressing in layers.” A “layer” is a different section of someth ing, one on top of another.  

“To wick (wick) moisture (moisture)” means for a pi ece of clothing to take the wetness – that’s what “moisture” is – from your ski n and move it away from your skin in order to keep your skin dry. It’s not a ver y common expression, “to wick moisture.” I don’t think I’ve ever used it before i n my life, but it is the technical way of describing what clothing can do to keep your  skin warm. Certain kinds of clothing, certain kinds of “fabric” (fabric) – the material from which clothing is made – can help remove the moisture from your skin,  preventing you from getting even colder.  

“To insulate” (insulate) something is to prevent so mething from getting too hot or too cold. In many houses in the United States, ther e is insulation in the walls. It’s a material that helps the house retain or keep the heat inside. In houses in the northern part of the United States this is very com mon, to have your house insulated. Well, your body can also be insulated in  such a way that the warmth of your body, the heat of your body, doesn’t escape an d therefore make you cold.  

That’s what Boris means when he says that the cloth ing that Kay is wearing is “insulating” her body from the cold. It’s also keep ing the cold air out so that the body doesn’t become cold. “The worst you’re going t o get,” Boris explains, “are dry skin and cracked lips.” “Dry skin” is when your  skin doesn’t have enough moisture, that can sometimes cause you to have itch y skin – where you want to scratch your skin because it is so dry. It can also  cause what is called “peeling” (peeling), where the outer layer of your skin begin s to come off.  

“Cracked (cracked) lips (lips)” is when your lips, which are the two things that are the outer part of your mouth, become so dry that th ey have little tears in them. The skin might even begin to “bleed” (bleed), which  is when blood comes out. To have “cracked lips” is to have lips that are so dry  that the skin begins to crack. It begins to open up, and that’s what causes the bleed ing and can also be quite painful. If you live in a cold area, you often have  to put something on your lips so that they don’t become too dry. The thing you put o n your lips to prevent them from becoming too dry is called “lip balm” (balm).  

Anyway, Boris is telling Kay that her situation is not going to become serious in terms of getting too cold. Kay says, “Then why do I  feel pins and needles in my hands and numbness in my feet?” The expression “pin s (pins) and needles (needles)” refers to a sensation or a feeling that part of your skin is perhaps being pierced or stuck with a pin or a needle. A “p in” is a small, thin piece of metal that can be used for a number of different pu rposes. The important thing to  

know is that both “pins” and “needles” have sharp p oints that, if you were to put it against your skin, would hurt.  

Kay is describing a feeling of pain that she is get ting on her skin – or if not pain, at least a weird feeling on her skin because she’s getting cold. She also describes “numbness” (numbness) in her feet. If you  are “numb” in some part of your body, you are unable to feel any heat, cold, o r touch to that part of your body, typically. We would say you “lack any sensati on” in that part of your body; your body isn’t able to feel the things it would no rmally feel, such as heat and cold.  

If you go to the dentist, the dentist will usually put something into your mouth. The dentist will inject something with a needle int o your mouth in order to make part of your mouth “numb” (numb) so that you won’t feel the dentist doing his or her work. Kay thinks that she has numbness in her f eet due to the cold. Boris says, “Maybe you’re just getting used to the cold,”  meaning maybe you just need a little more time and your body will adapt to the cold. “You’ll feel warmer in a minute,” he says.  

Kay responds, “But what if they’re signs of frostbi te?” She’s worried that this numbness, for example, is a sign of a very serious medical condition called “frostbite” (frostbite). “Frostbite” is a medical c ondition where part of your skin begins to die, in effect, because it’s too cold. It  can be very dangerous. Kay says, “I think I’ll turn back before I freeze.” “To turn back” is a two-word phrasal verb that here means to return to the place you left, to  go back to where you came from.  

Kay wants to go back to where she came from before she freezes. “To freeze” (freeze) means for a liquid to become a solid. Howe ver, Kay isn’t referring to the more scientific definition of freeze. She just mean s getting very, very cold. You may walk into a room that is very cold and say, “It ’s freezing in here.” You don’t mean it’s actually below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, whi ch is the freezing point for water. You mean it’s really, really cold, and that’ s what Kay means here.  

Boris says, “And miss out on these awe-inspiring wi nter views?” He’s saying that if Kay returns, she will “miss out” – that is, she will not be able to benefit from or appreciate these “awe-inspiring winter views.” A “v iew” (view) refers to something you can see, usually something that’s nice to look at. If you have a hotel room near the ocean, you may have an ocean view. You may  be able to see the ocean from your window, the window of your hotel room.  

Boris is saying to Kay that if she returns back hom e, or back to wherever she came from, she will miss out on some “awe-inspiring  (awe-inspiring) winter views.” Something that is “awe-inspiring” is someth ing that is very beautiful, something that is very powerful that affects you in  a good way. “Awe-inspiring” could be used to describe a view. It could be used to describe a piece of art or a piece of music, even.  

Kay says, “I prefer the awe-inspiring views of a bl azing fire.” “Blazing” (blazing) means burning brightly and warmly. If you have a fi re that you make from, say, several pieces of wood, and the fire is large or st rong, it might be described as being “blazing” – burning brightly and creating a l ot of heat so that if you stand near it, you will become warm. Kay says she would r ather be in front of a fire than in front of the “awe-inspiring winter views” t hat Boris wants her to see. I think if I were Kay, I would do the same thing.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Boris: Come on, keep climbing! This is the best exe rcise you’ll get all winter. 

Kay: My face hurts and I can’t stop shivering. 

Boris: If we pick up the pace, you’ll warm up. 

Kay: I doubt it. I can feel my core body temperatur e dipping. I feel hypothermia coming on. 

Boris: Don’t be silly. You’re dressed in layers, wi th fabric that wicks moisture away from your skin and insulates your body from th e cold. The worst you’re going to get are dry skin and cracked lips.

Boris: And miss out on these awe-inspiring winter v iews? 

Kay: I prefer the awe-inspiring views of a blazing fire!
