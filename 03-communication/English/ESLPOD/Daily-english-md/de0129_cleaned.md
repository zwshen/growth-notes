Rick: My friend Steve was supposed to come by here after work to give me a ride home. I lent him my car so he could take his girlfr iend out for the day. I've been waiting 45 minutes and he's a no-show. I should hav e known better than to count on a flake like him.  

Shawn: Maybe something came up. Have you tried call ing him on his cell phone? 

Rick: Yeah, I have and there's no answer. I can't b elieve he's left me high and dry.

Rick: Really? That would be great.  

Shawn: It's no big deal. But, I definitely don't wa nt to be there when you find Steve.

 The title of this episode is “A Flaky (flaky) Frien d.” The adjective “flaky” means unreliable, someone who doesn’t do what they tell y ou they will do. This is particularly true in a social obligation. Someone s ays they are going to meet you at the café at 2 o’clock and they don’t go on time or they don’t go at all. In fact, there is a noun which is a “flake” (flake) and that  is a person who is not reliable and there’s also a verb “to flake” or “to flake out ” – means that you do something – that you’re not reliable, that you don’t do what you’re supposed to do. Usually, it means that you don’t go somewhere where you are supposed to go. 

In this particular dialog, we begin with Shawn, who  asks her friend Rick, “What’s the matter?” meaning what is the problem. “You look  like you’re about to blow your lid. “To blow (blow) your lid (lid)” means you  are about to get angry. “To blow your lid” means to get very, very angry. You c an think of a pot of water that’s boiling. And there’s a top on it, because a “lid” (lid) is a top and if it boils too much, the lid may come off, because there’s so much  pressure. Well, here we use it just to mean to get very angry. And Rick say s, “Yeah, let’s just say I’m not happy.” The expression “Let’s just say” is used bef ore an expression of how we are feeling or what we are thinking, but we don’t w ant the other person to know completely. We want to make it more relaxed or more  mild. So, if I’m really angry, for example, but I don’t want to say it to the othe r person, I’m really angry, I might say, “Let’s just say I’m somewhat upset. I’m a litt le mad at you.” And the other person knows that, of course, the truth is much gre ater and much more serious and usually, we – well, often we use this expressio n when we’re angry or there’s a problem with something. And rather than give the complete truth, we say more politely and more nicely than what we are thinking.   

Well, when Rick says, “I’m not happy,” Shawn replie s, “That’s putting it lightly.” “To put something lightly (lightly)” means, once ag ain, it’s like the expression, “Let’s just say.” “To put something lightly” means that you’re being very polite that you’re angry or you’re upset but you’re not express ing that, you’re not saying that to the other person. Shawn then asks Rick, “What’s up?” meaning what’s going on. Tell me what is happening. And Rick says that h is friend Steve was supposed to come by here after work. When you say someone is  going to “come by (by)” that’s one of those two word verbs in English. It m eans that they are going to go to that place. So, “Someone is going to come by my house,” means someone is going to come to my house. Usually, it means to mak e a visit, for example, or to pick someone up, to give someone a ride. I’ll come by at 7:30 and we will then go to dinner. So, I’m going to go to your house, you’r e going to get into my car and then we will go to dinner together. Well, I’m not p aying but, you know, I’ll give you the ride.  

Well, Rick’s friend Steve was supposed to give him a “ride home.” And to give someone a “ride (ride) home” means that they go wit h you in your car and you are driving. So, I give you a ride to the restauran t. Rick says that he “lent” Steve his car, meaning he let him use his car so that he could take his girlfriend out for the day. And he waits for 45 minutes and says that Steve is a “no-show.” A “no (no-show)” – a “no-show” is someone who doesn’t sho w up, someone who doesn’t arrive, who doesn’t come to the place where  they are supposed to. Rick then says, “I should have known better than to coun t on a flake like him.” The expression “I should have known better” means I was  stupid, I didn’t think, I should have – I wish I would have thought. And “sho uld” has that sense of obligation. So, when we say, “I should have done so mething” that means that it was desirable or necessary that something be done, but it didn’t happen. Well, Steve says that he should have known better than to  “count on a flake.” Well, we already know what “flake” means – that’s a person w ho is flaky, who is unreliable. “To count on someone” means that we dep end on them, that we rely on them. “I’m counting on you to help me with my ho mework” would be a use of that verb. “I’m counting on winning the lottery so that I don’t have to work.” Well, good luck. 

Shawn then says, “Maybe something came up” with Ric k’s friend Steve. The expression “Something came up” means that you were supposed to do something, you were supposed to, for example, go to  the restaurant at 7 P.M., but then your mother calls and tells you to come ov er and help her with something. Well, you call your friend and you say, “I’m sorry, I can’t go to the restaurant. Something came up,” meaning something e lse – there’s something else that I have to do that’s very important. Rick says that it’s possible. 

 He did try calling his friend Steve on his cell ph one and then he says, “I can’t believe he’s left me high and dry.” “To leave someo ne high (high) and dry (dry)” means that you leave them without any other possibl e options. Usually, we use this expression when, for example, you are supposed  to give someone a ride, and you don’t show up, you don’t go. And that perso n doesn’t have any other way of getting where they want to go. “You leave th em high and dry,” meaning they’re stranded – would be another way of saying t hat. “To be stranded” (stranded) means that you are somewhere, but you ca n’t leave that place because you have no way of leaving. 

Shawn then says, “Tell you what. I’m almost done wi th my report.” The expression “Tell you what” means I am going to offe r something to you. I’m going to give you something or offer to give you somethin g – that’s how it is used here. You could also say, “Tell you what. I’ll go to the store and buy the food if you cook it.” So, when you are making – it’s sometimes used when you are making  

an agreement between two people. Well, Shawn offers  to give her friend Rick a “lift home.” A “lift” (lift) is the same as a ride home. Rick says, Wow, that’s great! And Shawn says, “It’s no big deal,” meaning it’s no t really anything difficult for me or it is not anything you need to thank me very muc h for.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
