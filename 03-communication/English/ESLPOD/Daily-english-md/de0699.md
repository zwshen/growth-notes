[start of dialogue]

Fredo:  I feel like a prisoner in my own home!  I c an’t step outside without the paparazzi snapping pictures of me.  They stake out my house 24 hours a day.

Amanda:  I suppose that’s the price of fame.  You d o have the most popular podcast in the world.

Fredo:  But they’re such a pain in the neck!  They don’t just take pictures.  They chase me in my car and follow me into restrooms, tr ying to corner me.  It’s an invasion of privacy.

Amanda:  You’re right, but look on the bright side.   The paparazzi give you plenty of exposure.  They keep your name – and your face –  in the spotlight.

Fredo:  It would be fine if they just took a few ca ndid shots while I’m at dinner or at the store, but they try to take photos when I’m out of town, trying to catch me doing something I shouldn’t.

Amanda:  At least, that’s good news for your wife.  She can call off that private detective she hired to follow you from city to city !

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Fredo saying to Amanda, “I  feel like a prisoner in my own home!”  A “prisoner” is someone who is in priso n, which is the same as jail, when the government – the police arrest you and kee p you in a building that’s

called the “prison,” and you are a prisoner.  Fredo  says he feels like a prisoner in his own home.  “I can’t step outside (meaning I can ’t go outside my house) without the paparazzi snapping pictures of me.”  the “paparazzi” (paparazzi) are photographers who try to take pictures of famous pe ople and sell them to newspapers and magazines.  The paparazzi are snappi ng pictures of Fredo.  “To snap” (snap) here means to take a photograph, to us e a camera to take a picture.  You can say “I’m going to take a picture, ” or you could say “I’m going to snap a picture,” they mean the same thing.  “Snap” also is the sound that you make with your fingers when you put them together q uickly, like this [Jeff snaps his fingers], that’s also “to snap.”  Fredo said, “ They stake out my house 24 hours a day.”  “To stake (stake) out” is a two-word phras al verb meaning to watch some place or some person in a hidden, secret way.  You’ re trying to observe what this person is doing without the person knowing that you  are watching.

Amanda says, “I suppose that’s the price of fame.”  “The price of fame” or “being famous” are the disadvantages or negative consequen ces of being famous.  You have a lot of advantages, but you also have disadva ntages.  The disadvantages constitute or make up the price of fame.  Amanda sa ys, “You do have the most popular podcast in the world.”  Fredo says, “But th ey’re,” meaning the paparazzi, “they’re such a pain in the neck!”  “To be a pain i n the neck” means someone or something is bothering you, is annoying you, is mak ing you very uncomfortable. “My boss is a pain in the neck.”  That means he ann oys me, he makes me mad, he upsets me, he gives me a lot of trouble.  “Pain in the neck” is the nice way of saying it; some people might also say “pain in the butt” (butt).  Your “butt,” of course, is what you sit on, and other people use ot her words for “butt” that we won’t mention here on the podcast.  “Pain in the ne ck,” then, is an informal expression, meaning someone or something that is an noying.

Fredo says, “They don’t just take pictures (these p aparazzi).  They chase me in my car and follow me into restrooms.”  “To chase” ( chase) means to follow someone, usually in their car, but it could be ridi ng a bicycle or running after you. The person is usually moving very fast trying to ca tch you, trying to get you before you leave.  Fredo says that the paparazzi ch ase him in his car and follow him into “restrooms,” or bathrooms, trying to corne r him.  “To corner (someone)” means to put someone in a position where that perso n can’t leave because there’s nowhere else to go.  You could do that phys ically, you could corner someone, make sure that they can’t leave.  Usually you do that when you want to talk to them or do something they don’t want to do.   You can also corner someone in a more general sense of not giving them very many options, limiting their ability to do other things that you don’t wan t them to do.

Fredo says, “It’s an invasion of privacy.”  “Privac y” is related to the word “private,” which means secret, hidden, other people don’t know  about what you want to keep secret or keep hidden.  Sometimes people say, “I’m a very private person,” meaning they don’t like to talk about their persona l life with other people.  The word “invasion” (invasion) is usually when some gro up of soldiers, people in the military – the army, the navy – go into some place and take it over.  But here, “invasion of privacy” means someone is going into y our private life, is finding out about things that they have no right to know.

Amanda says, “You’re right, but look on the bright side.”  “To look on the bright side” is an expression meaning to see the advantage s of what may seem like a bad situation, to be positive, to be optimistic.  I f you lose your girlfriend or your boyfriend, you should always look on the bright sid e; there are other men and women out there in the world for you.  Or, if someo ne steals your car, you have to look on the bright side; you will now get more e xercise by walking!  See, there’s always a positive thing that can be said of  a negative situation.

Amanda says, “The paparazzi give you plenty of expo sure.  They keep your name – and your face – in the spotlight.”  “To be i n the spotlight” means to get a lot of attention from other people, the newspapers and the television programs for example.  That’s to be in the spotlight, to get  a lot of attention.

Fredo says, “It would be fine (it would be okay) if  they just took a few candid shots while I’m at dinner or at the store.”  “Candi d” (candid) can mean very honest, but when we’re talking about photography it ’s a picture of someone who isn’t posing for the picture; they’re not looking a  certain way or smiling a certain way.  A candid photograph is one where typically yo u don’t even know that you’re being photographed, or you don’t act any different because you are being photographed.  A “shot” is another word for a pictu re, so “candid shots” would be pictures of someone who doesn’t know they’re being photographed or doesn’t care – doesn’t act any differently.

Fredo says that the paparazzi try to take photograp hs of him when he’s “out of town,” meaning visiting another city, “trying to ca tch me doing something I shouldn’t.”  “To catch (someone)” means to watch th em and find out what they’re doing that might be wrong, usually something they’r e trying to hide or keep secret.  “The teacher caught one of her students ch eating.”  “Caught” is the past tense of “catch.”  Or you could say, “The father ca ught his daughter talking on the phone late at night,” she wasn’t supposed to, she w as supposed be sleeping. The father caught her.  Fredo says that the paparaz zi are trying to catch him doing something wrong, doing something he shouldn’t  do.

Amanda says, “At least, that’s good news for your w ife.  She can call off that private detective she hired to follow you from city  to city!”  “To call off” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to end something, to canc el, to abandon, to tell someone you don’t need them to continue doing what they were doing.  If you have dogs to protect you in your house and they sta rt to chase someone who is coming to your house – they start to go after them – the person may yell, “Call off your dogs,” meaning tell your dogs to stop attackin g me.  “Call off” is often used for investigations or searches.  “The police called  off their search for the missing dog,” they stopped looking for the dog.  Why were t hey looking for the dog?  I don’t know.  Or you could say, “The baseball game w as called off last night because of rain,” it was canceled.  Or, “The man ca lled off his wedding,” he decided he wasn’t going to marry the woman he said he was going to marry. That’s not very nice!

Amanda says that the wife of Fredo can call off tha t private detective she hired. A “private detective” is someone whose job it is to  find out secret information about you, usually by taking pictures of what you a re doing.  This is something a wife might do if she thinks her husband is going wi th another woman; she may hire, or employ, a private detective to follow him.   Amanda is making a joke, of course, saying that because the paparazzi are alway s taking pictures of Fredo, his wife doesn’t have to worry about him going with  another woman, we would say “cheating on her,” because they will find out i f he does.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
