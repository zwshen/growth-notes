# Describing Chance and Probability

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 921 – Describing Chance and Probability.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 920. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide. You can download it at ESLPod.com.

This episode is a dialogue that’s going to give us some of the vocabulary we use in talking about taking a chance or how likely some thing is – what we call “probability.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Raul: What are the chances that Rob will be here on  time?

Tiffany: I’d say it’s fifty-fifty. You never know. He might surprise us and be early.

Raul: Fat chance of that happening. I’ve known him for three years, and if I had to stake my life on whether he’ll arrive early or n ot, I’d be in big trouble.

Tiffany: Don’t exaggerate. Rob isn’t completely irr esponsible. I’d say there’s a pretty good probability that he’ll be here when he said he would, especially after he promised.

Raul: His intentions are good, but he loses track of time and doesn’t know what day it is half the time.

Tiffany: He told me that he’s trying to change.

Raul: Well, as I said, his intentions are good. He just needs to work on his follow- through.

Tiffany: Come on, he could be on his way right now.

Raul: Don’t hold your breath. I’ll believe his prom ises when hell freezes over.

Tiffany: Aren’t you being just a wee bit cynical?

 Raul: And aren’t you just indulging in wishful thin king?

Tiffany: Hey, I think that’s him coming down the ro ad! I think you’d better eat your words.

Raul: And I think you’d better get glasses.

Raul says to Tiffany, “What are the chances that Ro b will be here on time?” “What are the chances” means “How likely is it?” What is the probability that Rob will be here on time? Normally, when we talk about the chances or the probability, people give a percentage – how likely something is to happen. For example, the people who try to forecast the weather , who try to say whether it’s going to rain tomorrow or not, usually give the cha nce of rain in a percentage. “There’s a 50 percent chance it will rain tomorrow, ” or “There’s an 80 percent chance that it will rain tomorrow.” Tiffany says – in talking about the chances of Rob being here on time, she says – “I’d say it’s 50 -50.” “50-50” means it could be that he shows up on time or not. There’s an equal p robability.

Tiffany says, “You never know. He might surprise us  and be early.” Raul doesn’t believe this, however. He says, “Fat chance of that  happening.” The expression “fat (fat) chance” is an informal one which means s omething is very unlikely, almost impossible. It’s a very informal expression.  It has nothing to do with someone being fat, someone being overweight. It jus t means that there is not a very good chance. In fact, it’s almost impossible. If my friend says to me, “I’m going to walk over to that woman and ask for her ph one number.” And I say to him, “Fat chance,” which means she is not going to give you her phone number, maybe her email address. I guess people give out em ail addresses now. I don’t know.

Anyway, Raul says, “I’ve known him” – I’ve known Ro b” – “for three years, and if I had to stake my life on whether he’ll arrive earl y or not, I’d be in big trouble.” The expression “to stake (stake) your life on somet hing” means to be completely sure of something, so sure that you would die if yo u were wrong. That’s how sure you are. You’re saying, “You can kill me if I’m not  correct,” in a way. “I’ll stake my life on something” means “I’m absolutely sure that this is true.” Raul, however, is saying that “If I had to stake my life on this fact  – that Rob will arrive early – I would be in big trouble. If that situation were tru e, I would be in a lot of trouble. I would be in big trouble. I would have a lot of prob lems.”

 Tiffany says, “Don’t exaggerate.” “To exaggerate” m eans to make something seem more important, or larger, or worse than it re ally is. Raul is saying that there is no chance that Rob will arrive early. Tiff any says, “Don’t exaggerate. Rob isn’t completely irresponsible.” “To be irresponsib le” means to be not responsible, to not worry about the negative consequences of you r actions. That would be “irresponsible.” “Rob is not completely irresponsib le,” Tiffany says. “I’d say there’s a pretty good probability” – a pretty good chance – “that he’ll be here when he said he would, especially after he promised ,” or especially because he promised to be here on time.

Raul says, “His intentions are good.” Rob’s “intent ions” are the things that he plans on doing. Your “intentions” are your plans – what you want to do, what you are planning on doing. Raul says, “His intentions a re good.” He wants to do the right thing. “But he loses track of time and doesn’ t know what day it is half the time.” The expression “to lose track (track) of” so mething means to not be paying attention and then not to know where something is. Normally we use this expression with time, to mean to not know what time  it is, to be so involved in some activity that you don’t realize what the time is and often are late for things that you should not be late for. “To lose track of time,” then, means not to know what time it is because you’re so busy doing other things.

Raul says that’s what happens to Rob. “He loses tra ck of time and doesn’t know what day it is.” He doesn’t know if today is Monday  or Tuesday or Wednesday. He “doesn’t know what day it is half the time.” The  expression “half the time” doesn’t really refer specifically to what time it i s. It’s a general expression meaning “usually,” or at least 50 percent of the ti me. Half the time, I don’t know where my dog is. That means I usually don’t know wh ere he is. Fifty percent of the time, I don’t know where he is. Of course, it w ould be very difficult for me to lose track of my dog because I don’t own a dog, but  if I did own a dog, I probably wouldn’t know where he was half the time.

Tiffany says, “He told me that he’s trying to chang e.” Raul said, “Well, as I said,” – as I already mentioned – “his intentions are good . He just needs to work on” – to work harder on – “his follow-through.” “Follow-t hrough” (through) means doing what you promised to do. Tiffany says, “Come on. He  could be on his way right now.” The expression “come on” here is used to indi cate that Tiffany disagrees with Raul. Tiffany thinks Raul is being unreasonabl e or is exaggerating. Tiffany says, “Rob could be on his way right now.” “To be o n your way,” means you are moving in a certain direction. You are travelling in a certain direction.

Raul doesn’t believe, however, that Rob is on his w ay. He says, “Don’t hold your breath.” This expression, “don’t hold your breath,”  means don’t wait for something to happen, because it probably won’t happ en. We use this expression, “don’t hold your breath,” when we are saying to som eone, “I don’t think you should expect that. I don’t think you should get yo ur hopes up. I don’t think you should be anticipating that happening, because it p robably won’t happen.” “To hold your breath,” of course, means not to breathe.  So, if you hold your breath for a long time, you will possibly die. So, “don’t hold  your breath” means don’t hold your breath until this happens, because it will be a very long time before it does, and then you’ll be dead.

Raul doesn’t believe Rob will be here on time. In f act, he says, “I’ll believe his promises when hell freezes over.” This is an old ex pression, “when hell freezes over,” that is used to show that you don’t believe this will ever happen. “Hell” is, according to some traditions, a place where you go after you die if you have been evil or bad during your life. “Hell” is very hot. S o, for hell to freeze over – for water to freeze in hell – would be basically impossible, because hell is supposed to be a very hot place full of fire and that sort of thin g.

There’s a related expression, “a snowball’s chance in hell.” A “snowball” is a round ball made of snow. “A snowball’s chance in he ll” would not be very good. In other words, because hell is so hot, the snowbal l will melt. It doesn’t have a chance. It won’t survive. That’s what it means. Bot h of these expressions are very informal. You wouldn’t use them in a formal bu siness situation.

Tiffany says, “Aren’t you being just a wee bit cyni cal?” A “wee (wee) bit (bit)” is an old expression that means a little bit, a tiny a mount. It’s often used sarcastically. It’s often used jokingly when someon e is actually doing something in a much larger amount or in a much larger way. Ti ffany is saying that Raul is being a “wee bit cynical.” What she really means is  he’s being very cynical. “To be cynical” (cynical) means not to believe somethin g, especially not to believe that other people are good or have good intentions.

Raul says, “And aren’t you just indulging in wishfu l thinking?” “To indulge (indulge) in wishful thinking” means to pretend tha t everything is good, that everything is happy, even when it is not. We do this sometimes so that we don’t get depressed – so that we don’t feel unhappy – but  it’s not realistic. It’s not what is actually happening in the world.

Tiffany says, “Hey, I think that’s him coming down the road!” Tiffany thinks she sees Rob walking down the street. Tiffany says, “I think you’d better eat your words.” “To eat your words” is a somewhat odd expre ssion. It means to be forced

to admit that you are wrong. This is often used whe n it’s an embarrassing situation for the person to admit that they’ve made  a mistake, that they’re wrong.

Raul, however, at the end of the dialogue still doe sn’t believe he’s wrong. He says, “I think you’d better get glasses,” meaning T iffany is not seeing what she thinks she sees. She needs glasses so that she can see better, and if she had glasses, she would see that it was not Rob who is w alking down the road.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Raul: What are the chances that Rob will be here on  time?

Tiffany: I’d say it’s fifty-fifty. You never know. He might surprise us and be early.

Raul: Fat chance of that happening. I’ve known him for three years, and if I had to stake my life on whether he’ll arrive early or n ot, I’d be in big trouble.

Tiffany: Don’t exaggerate. Rob isn’t completely irr esponsible. I’d say there’s a pretty good probability that he’ll be here when he said he would, especially after he promised.

Tiffany: Aren’t you being just a wee bit cynical?

Raul: And aren’t you just indulging in wishful thin king?

Tiffany: Hey, I think that’s him coming down the ro ad! I think you’d better eat your words.

 Raul: And I think you’d better get glasses.
