This episode is a dialogue between Kiko and Rafael about getting a mortgage loan –  getting money to buy a house. Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Kiko: Figuring out how to fill out this mortgage lo an application is like trying to read a foreign language. I don’t know what all thes e terms mean.

Rafael: Let’s see if we can figure it out together.  I think we want a fixed-rate mortgage, not an adjustable-rate mortgage. We want to lock in a good annual percentage rate and not worry about the rate going up.

Kiko: All right, I think that’s what we want. We wa nt the principal and interest payments to be predictable.

Rafael: That’s right.

Kiko: And what are points?

Rafael: I think that has to do with fees for gettin g the loan.

Kiko: It looks like we have to get an appraisal of the house we want to buy.

Rafael: Yes, that’s standard, I think.

Kiko: Do we have to pay for private mortgage insura nce?

Rafael: Not if we have a down payment of more than 20 percent of the price of the house.

Kiko: Okay, so we don’t need to worry about that ex pense, but what about all these others?

Rafael: Like what?

Kiko: Like homeowners insurance and title insurance ?

Rafael: I’m not sure.

Kiko: And what are balloon payments and prepayment penalties?

Rafael: You got me.

Kiko: And what’s included in the closing costs?

Rafael: I’m really out of my depth here.

Kiko: Me, too. What should we do now?

Rafael: Continue to rent?

Our dialogue begins with Kiko saying to Rafael, “Fi guring out how to fill out this mortgage loan application is like reading a foreign  language.” Kiko and Rafael are filling out or completing – putting information  into – a mortgage loan application. A “mortgage (mortgage) loan (loan)” is  money that you get from a bank, that you borrow from a bank to buy a home, to  buy a house or a condominium.

Kiko says that “filling out the application is like  trying to read a foreign language,” meaning it’s very difficult. She can’t understand w hat it is saying. She says, “I don’t know what all these terms,” or words, “mean.”  Rafael says, “Let’s see if we can figure it out together” – let’s see if we can u nderstand it together. He says, “I think we want a fixed-rate mortgage, not an adjusta ble-rate mortgage.” The “rate” (rate) on a loan is the percentage of money that yo u have to pay on the loan.

So, for example, if you have a loan of $100, and the rate – we would call it the “interest rate” – is 10 percent, that means you hav e to pay $10 on that loan. Here we’re talking about different kinds of rates, two d ifferent kinds of rates for a mortgage. One is a fixed-rate. A “fixed-rate” is wh en the bank tells you, “Okay, we’re going to give you $100,000, or $500,000, and you have to pay every year 5

percent interest, and that will not change. It will  always be 5 percent. It’s “fixed” (fixed).

Another kind of mortgage loan you can get from a ba nk is called an “adjustable- rate mortgage.” The word “adjustable” comes from the verb “to adjust” (adjust). “To adjust” means to change, and an adjustable-rate  mortgage is a mortgage that has a changing rate. So, this year it might be  5 percent, but next year, depending on how the economy is doing, it might be 7 percent. An adjustable- rate mortgage is usually easier to get, however, it ’s unpredictable. You don’t know what your interest rate is going to be 10 year s from now.

Rafael is saying that he thinks they want to get a fixed-rate mortgage. He says, “We want to lock in a good annual percentage rate a nd not worry about the rate going up.” “To lock in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to agree with someone – in this case, the bank – on a specific nu mber or amount so that it can’t be changed in the future. If the bank says, “ We’re going to charge you 5 percent interest on your loan,” and you say, “Okay,  I want to lock in that rate,” you’re saying you want that rate to be fixed. You d on’t want it to move. You don’t want it to change.

That’s what Rafael is talking about. He wants to “l ock in a good annual percentage rate.” The “annual percentage rate” is the interest rate for a given year, for each year that you to pay the bank to hav e the money, to borrow the money. Kiko agrees. She says, “All right, I think t hat’s what we want. We want the principle and interest payments to be predictab le.”

When you borrow money from a bank, there are two ki nds of payments that you are making back to the bank. The first is the “prin cipal” (principal). The principal of a loan is the actual money that the bank is givi ng you. So, if the bank is giving you $100, your principal on the loan is $100. But of course, the bank isn’t giving you the money for free. You have to pay the bank to  use its money. The money that you pay the bank – the price of the loan, if y ou will – is the interest.

The interest is the money you pay to get the loan, or the money you pay that the bank gets for giving you the loan. Usually when you  have a mortgage loan in the United States, or a car loan, you are giving the ba nk part of the principal back each time you send in money, but you are also givin g them part of the interest. Kiko says, “We want the principal and interest paym ents to be predictable.” “To be predictable” means you know what they’re going to be in the future. “Predictable” comes from the verb “to predict” (pre dict), which means to guess or estimate what will happen in the future.

Rafael agrees with her. He says, “That’s right.” Ki ko then asks Rafael to explain to her the meaning of the word “points” (points). W ell, the word “points” can mean a couple of different things, but here, when we’re talking about mortgage loans, it refers to an additional price that you have to pay in order to get the loan. It’s an additional price that you pay besides the interest for the loan. Usually it’s money that you have to give the bank before you even get the loan. “Points” refers to a percentage of the loan that you have to pay as a fe e to the bank.

So, on our $100 loan, we might have to pay 10 perce nt interest, which would be $10 every year that we have the loan, but in additi on, when we get the loan, we have to give the bank perhaps a dollar or two dolla rs. Those payments would be called “points,” and they have to be, usually, paid  when you first get the loan. Rafael says, “I think that has to do with fees for getting the loan,” and Rafael is correct.

Kiko then says, “It looks like we have to get an ap praisal of the house we want to buy.” An “appraisal” (appraisal) is an official est imate – when someone comes in and says, “This is how much your house is really wo rth.” You get an expert, someone who knows a lot about houses, to come and l ook at the house and say, “Well, this house is worth $200,000,” or “This cond ominium is worth $150,000.” Most banks will ask an expert to go and look at you r house and give it an appraisal.

The bank doesn’t want to give you more money for the house than it’s worth. So, the loan amount has to be less than the appraisal a mount. So if you want to borrow, say, $100,000 on a condominium, and the ban k sends a person out, an expert whom we would call an “appraiser,” to look a t the condominium and the appraiser decides it’s only worth $50,000, the bank  isn’t going to give you a $100,000 loan, because the appraisal wasn’t high en ough to justify a loan of that size.

Rafael says, “Yes, that’s standard, I think.” The e xpression here, “That’s standard,” means that’s normal – that’s what you no rmally have to do when you get a mortgage loan; and again, Rafael is correct. Kiko then asks, “Do we have to pay for private mortgage insurance?” “Private mortg age insurance,” sometimes abbreviated “PMI,” is basically insurance that you get in case for some reason you can’t pay off your loan. The bank wants to be s ure it is going to get its money back.

So, private mortgage insurance is money that you, the borrower, the person getting the money, has to pay in order to make sure  that in case there are any problems with your payments, the bank gets its mone y – from an insurance

company, in this case. Rafael says, “Not if we have  a down payment of more than 20 percent of the price of the house.” A “down  payment” is money that you have to give the bank in order to get the loan to b egin with.

Usually the down payment is a certain percentage of  the price of the house. It may be 10 percent. It may be 20 percent. That means  if you’re buying a $200,000 house, and the bank says you have to make a 20 percent down payment, the bank is saying you have to give the ba nk $40,000 before the bank will give you money to buy the rest of the house, o r to pay for the rest of the house. So, the $40,000 is part of the price of the house, but the money goes to the bank.

The bank wants to be sure that you are going to giv e them the rest of their money that they are loaning you. Sometimes, if you have a big down payment – if you put a large percentage of the cost of the ho use in as your down payment – you don’t have to buy the private mortgage insuranc e.

Kiko then says, “Okay, so we don’t need to worry ab out that expense” – that cost – “but what about all these others?” Rafael says, “ Like what?” Kiko says, “Like homeowners insurance and title insurance.” “Homeown ers insurance” is insurance you buy in case something bad happens to your house – in case you have a fire or there is an earthquake, perhaps, whi ch is not uncommon here in California. Homeowners insurance is insurance that will help you rebuild your house or fix your house in case it’s damaged.

“Title insurance” refers to special insurance that you buy in case there’s some problem with the legal documents related to the own ership of your house. The “title” of a house or the “title” of a car is not the name of the house or the car. It refers to the legal document, the legal agreement, that says who owns this house or this car.

Kiko asks about “balloon payments and prepayment pe nalties.” A “balloon (balloon) payment,” in the context of a mortgage lo an, refers to a large amount of money that you have to pay at the very end of your loan period. Let’s say you have a loan for 10 years. At the end of that 10 yea rs, usually, when you have a balloon payment, you have to give a large amount of  money at the very end to pay off the loan.

Kiko also asks about “prepayment penalties.” For so me loans, you actually get a penalty if you pay the loan early. That’s the meani ng of “prepayment” – to give the bank more money than you are supposed to accord ing to your agreement. A “penalty” is a punishment – something you have to p ay, usually, in the case of a

 prepayment penalty. It’s extra money that you have to give the bank if you are paying your loan off – that is, giving the bank bac k all of its money – early.

Why does a bank charge prepayment penalties on mort gage loans? Well, because they make more money if you continue to pay  the interest on the loan every year. So, some banks have a prepayment penalt y, but not all of them. Rafael doesn’t understand these terms, the ones abo ut balloon payments and prepayment penalties. That’s why he responds to Kik o by saying, “You got me.” “You got me” in this context means “I don’t underst and either.” I don’t know the answer to that question either.

Then Kiko asks, “And what’s included in the closing  costs?” The closing costs are the expenses, the money that you have to pay when the loan is approved. In order to get your money from the bank to buy the ho use, you have to make sure all of the fees and costs of the loan are taken care of, or paid for, and that’s what is referred to here as “closing costs.” Closing cos ts are separate from the actual price of the home.

Once again, Rafael does not know the answer to this  question. He says, “I’m really out of my depth (depth) here.” If you are “o ut of your depth,” you don’t understand something. You are in a situation that is too complicated for you. You’re in a situation where you don’t know how to g et out of it. You don’t know what you are doing, basically.

Kiko says, “Me, too. What should we do now?” Rafael  asks, “Continue to rent?” In other words, instead of buying a house, they’ll just continue renting because getting a mortgage loan is too complicated for them .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
