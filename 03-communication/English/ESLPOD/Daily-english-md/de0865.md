This episode is a dialog between Armond and Patrici a about believing in people who say they can predict the future. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialog]

Armond:  I hope that this new year will bring me be tter luck.

Patricia:  You can find that out easily enough.  My  astrologer says...

Armond:  Hold on.  You consult an astrologer?  You really believe in that nonsense?

Patricia:  It’s not nonsense and, yes, I believe in  it.  I like getting predictions about the future and knowing what is in the stars for me.

Armond:  Astrologers are charlatans and what they t ell their customers is phony. They make it all up and tell people what they want to hear.

Patricia:  I don’t know how you can say that.  The horoscope for my sign each day gives me warnings and helps me avoid mistakes.  And when I have big decisions to make, I go for a reading.  The guidanc e I get is invaluable.

Armond:  You’re too smart to be taken in by con art ists who style themselves as mystics.  It’s all smoke and mirrors.

Patricia:  You’re wrong.  I’ll give you an example.   My horoscope today said that an unpleasant person will try to shake my beliefs.  It said I should just walk away.

Armond:  Hey, where are you going?

Armond begins our dialog by saying “I hope that thi s new year will bring me better luck.” He hopes that good things will happen  to him this year. Patricia says, “You can find that out easily enough,” meanin g it’s very simple. It’s very easy to get that answer. “You can find that out eas ily enough,” she says. “My astrologer says…” An “astrologer” (astrologer) is a  person who studies the movements of the planets and the stars in the belie f that somehow that will help him understand people and be able to predict events  in the future.

Astrology has been around for thousands of years. P eople have always believed somehow that what is up in the sky somehow controls  what happens here on earth and apparently, there are still people today who believe such a thing. Armond says, “Hold on. You consult an astrologer?” “To consult” (consult) here means to get someone’s advice about something, to s eek someone’s guidance, to get their suggestions. In this case, it means to  talk to an astrologer and ask that person what the future will bring you – what w ill happen in your future.

Armond says, “You really believe in that nonsense?”  “Nonsense” is something that isn’t logical. It is not rational. You shouldn ’t take it seriously. It makes no sense. Patricia says, “It’s not nonsense and yes, I  believe in it. I like getting predictions about the future.” A “prediction” is a guess about what will happen in the future. Tomorrow it will rain. I predict that i t will rain tomorrow. That’s what I think will happen.

Patricia likes getting predictions about the future  which – in a way, you don’t really need to say about the “future” because a pre diction is always about something that will happen in the future. But she s ays she likes getting predictions about the future and “knowing what is i n the starts for me.” “In the stars” here means what is meant to happen in the fu ture. Once again, the idea is somehow that the stars and the planets are controll ing our lives.

Armond says, “Astrologers are charlatans and what t hey tell their customers is phony.” A “charlatan” (charlatan) is someone who pr etends to be very intelligent, who says they know a lot about something but is act ually not. A charlatan is someone who lies in order to make you think that th ey know something. There are lots of charlatans on the Internet, for example , about almost every topic.

Armond says that astrologers are charlatans and wha t they tell their customers – the people who pay them money – is “phony” (phony).  “Phony” is fake, not real, false, not true. “They make it all up.” “To make so mething all up” is to invent it, to

say something as if it were true when you really do n’t have any idea whether it is true or not. The astrologers make it all up and tel l people what they want to hear. Patricia says, “I don’t know how you can say that,”  meaning I don’t understand why you are talking that way or saying those things .

“The horoscope for my sign each day gives me warnin gs and helps me avoid mistakes.” A “horoscope” (horoscope) is a predictio n or a description of what will happen to someone on a particular day and what they  should do about it. Horoscopes are based on or are determined, accordin g to astrologers, by when your birthday is and what the position of the stars  and the planets are. It’s a type of astrology. A lot of people like to read their ho roscope for their particular sign. Your “sign” refers to the 12 parts of what is calle d the “zodiac” (zodiac). Supposedly, this is an area where the stars and the  planets travel and they’re associated with a name and a symbol.

The calendar is divided up into 12 signs. Most peop le know their astrological sign even if they don’t believe in it. I was born in Sep tember and so I’m – late September – and so I’m a Libra. And then if you wer e born in a different month, you would be something else, one of the other 12 si gns of the zodiac. This again is part of this whole belief that somehow the stars  and the planets control us. Some people read their horoscopes just for fun. Mos t horoscopes are written so generally that they could probably be applied or it  would probably be true for almost anyone.

Patricia says, “When I have big decisions to make, I go for a reading.” A “reading” here means you go to this person, this as trologer, in this case, who will then predict what your future will be. Maybe they’l l look at your hands, your palms. Maybe they’ll look at some special cards. Ma ybe they’ll look at something else that’s supposed to help them predict what your  future will be. Patricia says when she has a big decision to make, she goes for a  reading. She goes to her astrologer. “The guidance I get” – the suggestions that she receives – “is invaluable,” meaning it’s worth a lot. It’s extreme ly valuable. It’s impossible to say how much because it is so valuable to you, so worth while to you.

Armond says, “You’re too smart” – you’re too intell igent – “to be taken in by con artists who style themselves as mystics.” Couple of  different expressions there – “to be taken in” means to be tricked or to be foole d by someone, for someone to lie to you and for you to believe it. That’s to be taken in. A “con artist” is a person who does something to trick you out of your money, to fool you into giving him your money. “Con” is short for “confidence,” basica lly, trust that you have in that person, that that person is able to get you to give  them. That’s what a con artist does.

 Armond says that Patricia is too smart to be taken in by con artists who style themselves as mystics. “To style (style) yourself a s something” means to present yourself in a certain way, to pretend that you are something that you really aren’t. In this case, the con artists are styling themselve s as mystics. A “mystic” (mystic) is a person who is very spiritual, who seems to hav e a close relationship with God and is somehow closer to the truth than other p eople. Armond says, “It’s all smoke and mirrors.” The phrase “smoke (smoke) and m irrors (mirrors)” is used to describe a situation where what appears to be happe ning is not actually happening. The idea is that you are being fooled. Y ou are being tricked. You are being lied to. A person is doing something to make you believe something that isn’t true. “It’s all smoke and mirrors,” Armond sa ys.

Patricia says, “You’re wrong. I’ll give you an exam ple. My horoscope today says that an unpleasant person” – someone who’s not very  nice – “will try to shake my beliefs” – to shake my confidence in my beliefs. “T o shake (shake) someone’s confidence in their beliefs,” or “to shake someone’ s beliefs,” we might say, means to make another person doubt what they previo usly had believed, to make them less certain about something. Patricia sa ys that her horoscope told her that she should “walk away,” meaning she should  leave when she finds or meets this unpleasant person. Of course, what does she do? She turns around and leaves. Armond says, “Hey, where are you going? ” – indicating to us that Patricia is walking away from Armond because that’s  what her horoscope told her to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
