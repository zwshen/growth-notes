This episode is a dialogue between Lucinda and Thom as about expressing disapproval – when you don’t like something. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lucinda: Maggie and Gerry are moving in together. T hey want to start a family.

Thomas: I don’t approve of that. They’re not marrie d and it’s a disgrace. Shame on them!

Lucinda: I understand your objections, but they love each other and need our support, not our condemnation.

Thomas: If I were their parents, I’d give them an e arful. Someone should take them to task for making such irresponsible decision s.

Lucinda: They know what they’re doing and it’s not our place to criticize their decision.

Thomas: But I don’t have to like it. I’m not sendin g them a housewarming gift, that’s for sure.

Lucinda: Too late. I sent one and signed both our n ames.

Thomas: You did what?! How will they know I disappr ove of what they’re doing when you go behind my back and do that?

 Lucinda: I think your reproach will come through lo ud and clear.

Lucinda begins the dialogue by saying to Thomas, “M aggie and Gerry are moving in together. They want to start a family.” M aggie and her boyfriend Gerry are going to move in together – that means they’re going to live in the same place, the same house, the same apartment. They wan t to start a family.

Thomas says he doesn’t approve of that. “To approve ” (approve) is to agree that something is correct or, really, that something is good or acceptable – to accept what someone is doing. If I “approve of your decisi on,” I agree with your decision, or I say your decision is okay. “Approve” can mean both to say something is good or acceptable, as well as to give permission f or someone to do something. Your boss approves your plan for a new project. Her e the verb “to approve” means that you agree with it, that you agree it is correct.

Thomas doesn’t think the fact that Maggie and Gerry  are moving in together is a good thing. He points out that “they’re not married  and it’s a disgrace.” A “disgrace” (disgrace) is something that you should not be proud of, something that is considered what we would call “shameful” or  “dishonorable” – something that is perhaps immoral or unethical to do.

Thomas says, “Shame on them.” This expression “sham e (shame) on” someone is used to show how very much you disapprove of som ething – how you do not approve of what another person is doing and in fact  think that the person doing what you don’t agree with should be embarrassed by his or her actions. You think this person should feel bad about what he or she is doing.

Lucinda says, “I understand your objections.” An “o bjection” (objection) is when you say that you disagree with something. It’s a st atement to show that you think someone is wrong – usually it’s a reason why you th ink someone is wrong, although it could just be a statement showing that you oppose or disagree with another person. Someone may say, “I have objections  to this,” meaning I have reasons why I think this is wrong. Lucinda says, ho wever, that “they love each other and need our support, not our condemnation.”

“Condemnation” (condemnation) is when you disagree with another person and criticize them for their actions, especially when y ou think their actions are immoral or unethical, or simply wrong and harmful e ither to themselves or to others. Lucinda thinks that Maggie and Gerry need L ucinda and Thomas’s

support. She’s saying that Lucinda and Thomas shoul d help Maggie and Gerry, not condemn them, not criticize them, though I’m no t exactly sure why. I guess it’s because they love each other.

Thomas says, “If I were their parents, I’d give the m an earful.” “To give someone an earful,” (earful) means to tell someone that you  are very angry with that person, to perhaps yell at someone, to tell someone  why you think he or she is wrong, but to do so in an angry way. Thomas is sayi ng that if he were Maggie and or Gerry’s parents, he’d “give them an earful.”  He’d yell at them. He’d tell them in an angry way why they were wrong.

He says, “Someone should take them to task for maki ng such irresponsible decisions.” “To take someone to task” (task) means to criticize someone for something he has done wrong or to hold someone resp onsible for his mistakes. To say, “Well, you did this wrong, and therefore yo u have to take responsibility for being wrong.” “To take someone to task” is to t ell the person why he or she is wrong.

Thomas thinks this decision to move in together wit hout being married and to start a family is “irresponsible” (irresponsible). “To be irresponsible” is to be not responsible – that is, to not behave in a way that is necessary according to some rules or simply is a good idea. “To be irresponsibl e” means not to do what you are supposed to do.

Lucinda says, however, that “they know what they’re  doing and it’s not our place to criticize their decision.” To say something is “ not your place” to do something means it’s not your responsibility. It’s not for yo u to do. It’s not your duty. It’s not your role. Lucinda says it’s not Thomas and Lucinda ’s place to criticize Maggie and Gerry’s decision. “To criticize” means to show why someone is wrong, to show why someone has problems with something.

Thomas says, “But I don’t have to like it. I’m not sending them a housewarming gift, that’s for sure.” A “housewarming gift” is a present you give to someone who has moved into a new home or apartment. It’s sort of a way of congratulating someone, perhaps, of giving someone something he wi ll need in his new place. Lucinda says, “Too late,” meaning it’s too late not  to send them a housewarming gift because Lucinda just sent one “and signed both  our names,” meaning she said the gift was from both Thomas and Lucinda.

Thomas is not happy about this. He says, “You did w hat?! How will they know I disapprove of what they’re doing when you go behind  my back and do that?” “To disapprove,” of course, is the opposite of “to appr ove.” “To go behind someone’s

back” is to do something secretly without another p erson knowing. In this case, Lucinda went behind Thomas’s back. She didn’t tell Thomas what she was doing.

We often use this expression when it affects the pe rson you didn’t tell. So here, Lucinda sent a gift and signed both her and Thomas’ s name. She did this without telling Thomas. She “did it behind his back.” Thoma s wonders how Maggie and Gerry will know that he disapproves of what they ha ve done after she sent this gift with his signature on it.

Lucinda says, “I think your reproach will come thro ugh loud and clear.” A “reproach” (reproach) is a statement of disapproval , criticism, and disappointment in another person. It’s a somewhat formal word desc ribing when someone criticizes you, disapproves of what you did, often because of some ethical or moral failing on your part, meaning the person beli eves you did something wrong morally or ethically, not just because you broke a rule.

Lucinda thinks that Thomas’s reproach “will come th rough loud and clear.” The phrase “to come through loud and clear” means to be  easily understood by others. In this case, Lucinda thinks that Maggie an d Gerry will know that he disapproves of their actions despite the fact that Lucinda sent them a gift with Thomas’s signature on the card.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Thomas: I don’t approve of that. They’re not marrie d and it’s a disgrace. Shame on them!

Lucinda: I understand your objections, but they love each other and need our support, not our condemnation.

Lucinda: They know what they’re doing and it’s not our place to criticize their decision.

Thomas: But I don’t have to like it. I’m not sendin g them a housewarming gift, that’s for sure.

 Lucinda: Too late. I sent one and signed both our n ames.

Thomas: You did what?! How will they know I disappr ove of what they’re doing when you go behind my back and do that?

Lucinda: I think your reproach will come through lo ud and clear.
