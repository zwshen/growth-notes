This episode is a dialogue between Petra and Ken ab out trying to pay for something using different payment systems. Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Petra: Damn! That didn’t work either.

Ken: What are you doing?

Petra: I’m trying to pay for a new service I ordere d, but the website won’t accept my credit card as payment. I even tried my debit ca rd, but it’s been rejected, too.

Ken: Why don’t you just write a check and mail it i n?

Petra: I don’t have any checks. In this day and age , I should be able to use one of the many electronic funds transfer options.

Ken: What are going to do now?

Petra: I might try sending a wire, but my bank char ges a large fee for wires.

Ken: How about signing up for direct deposit?

Petra: If this were an ongoing service I would, but  this is a one-time thing. Do you think I could try your credit card?

Ken: I don’t know about that . . .

Petra: All right, if you feel funny about doing tha t then could you buy me a gift card for this website and then I can turn around an d use the balance?

Ken: That seems kind of involved. Would you pay me back in cash?

Petra: Of course. I will write you an IOU right now  and then go to the bank tomorrow.

Ken: How about if you go to the bank now. I’ll even  give you a ride.

Petra: Is that really necessary? We don’t even know  if it’s going to work.

Ken: When it comes to money, I always say “better s afe than sorry.”

[end of dialogue]

Petra begins our dialogue a little angry, so angry he uses a “swear (swear) word.” A “swear word” is a word you use when you ar e angry that is not a very nice word, not a word you should use in front of ch ildren or your boss. Petra says, “Damn! That didn’t work either.” The swear wo rd here, of course, is “damn” (damn). It’s a word some people use when they are f rustrated or angry. Petra seems to be angry because something didn’t work.

Petra explains, “I’m trying to pay for a new servic e I ordered, but the website won’t accept my credit card as payment.” Petra is b uying something on the web, on the internet, but the website she is using won’t  accept her credit card as payment. A “credit card,” you probably know, is a s mall plastic card that you can use to pay for things. There are a couple of large companies that have credit cards you can use, including MasterCard and Visa as  well as several others. You can use your credit card on the internet as well by  putting the numbers of your card into the website.

Petra says this website won’t accept her credit car d as “payment” – that is, money that you give to someone from whom you are bu ying something. Petra says, “I even tried my debit (debit) card.” A “debi t card” is a card that takes money directly out of your bank account. A “credit card” is when you buy something and a company, a bank, lends you money, b asically, until you pay it back. If you pay it back within 30 days, usually the bank will not charge you any money. When you use a credit card, you are essentia lly making a series of loans from the bank, and these are loans that you have to  pay back.

If you don’t pay them back, the bank will charge yo u interest. That’s what we call a “finance (finance) charge.” Some people have to p ay lots of money every month in “finance charges” because they don’t have enough money to pay for the loans that they took out that month from their cred it card company. We don’t usually call them “loans.” We call them “charges” ( charges). When you call them “charges,” people don’t think of them as loans anym ore. This is a very smart way that credit card companies get you to spend more mo ney.

Anyway, Petra is angry because she hasn’t been able  to use either her credit card or her debit card. She says, “The debit card h as been rejected” (rejected). When your credit card is “rejected,” you are not al lowed to use it. Another word here would be “denied” (denied). If your credit car d is “denied,” you are not able to use it. The bank is saying, “No, you can’t use i t.” Ken says, “Why don’t you just write a check and mail it in?” A “check” (check) is  a small piece of paper that you can use to take money out of your bank account.

Remember, a “debit card” is a way of electronically  taking money directly out of your bank account. A “check” is another way of taki ng money out of your bank account in order to give it to another person. The problem is that Petra doesn’t have any checks. This isn’t that unusual nowadays. Many people don’t have paper checks anymore because they pay for everythin g either with a credit card or a debit card or some other way of paying electro nically.

In fact, that’s exactly what Petra says. “In this d ay and age,” she says, “I should be able to use one of the many electronic funds tra nsfer options.” The expression “in this day and age” means nowadays or in modern t imes, I guess you might say. She’s saying she should be able to use an elec tronic funds transfer option. “Electronic Funds Transfer” is moving money between  two bank accounts or two different financial accounts without using any pape r money or any paper checks.

Ken says, “What are you going to do now?” Petra say s, “I might try sending a wire, but my bank charges a large fee for wires.” A  “wire” (wire) is when you send money electronically between two banks. It’s a part icular way of sending especially large amounts of money between two banks . This can be more expensive because banks often charge or make you pa y a large fee, a large amount of money, for wires.

Ken says, “How about signing up for direct deposit? ” “Direct deposit” is another way of electronically transferring money from one b ank account to another. Usually “direct deposit” is the term we use when yo ur company pays you by giving you money not with a paper check, but by dep ositing or putting that money directly into your bank account. In other words, the money is transferred from

your company’s bank account to your bank account. H owever, sometimes this term is used to describe the way people pay their b ills electronically.

For example, every month I have to pay the gas comp any the money that I owe them. But I don’t send them a check. I have that mo ney directly withdrawn, or taken from my bank account, and put into their bank  account. That arrangement can also be called sometimes a “direct deposit paym ent.” I’m not sending the company, the gas company, money through the mail. I ’m paying them electronically from my bank account to their bank a ccount.

Petra says, “If this were an ongoing service, I wou ld. But this is a one-time thing.” An “ongoing (ongoing) service” is one that continue s over a long period of time, one that repeats every month or every six months or  every week, even. Petra doesn’t want to use a direct deposit system because  “this is a one-time thing.” “One-time” means it is only going to happen a singl e time. It is only happening once. “Do you think I could try your credit card?” Petra asks. Ken says, “I don’t know about that.” Ken doesn’t want Petra using his credit card to buy this thing over the internet.

Petra says, “All right. If you feel funny about doi ng that,” meaning if you don’t think it’s a good idea, you think it’s strange, or you feel uncomfortable about it, “then could you buy me a gift card for this website  and then I can turn around and use the balance?” A “gift card” is usually a small plastic card like a credit card that you buy for someone else so that that person c an use it to buy things at a certain store. So, you go to a big store and you bu y a $50 gift card for someone. That person can then buy something at that store, b ut only at that store, using that $50 gift card.

Gift cards now can also be used electronically. Tha t’s what Petra is suggesting that Ken do for her. She will then use this gift ca rd that Ken buys her to buy something on that website. That’s what she means by  the expression “use the balance” (balance). The “balance” refers to the amo unt of money on the gift card, in this case. “Balance” can also refer to the amoun t of money you have in your bank account.

Ken says, “That seems kind of involved,” meaning th is seems a little complicated – too complicated. He then asks, “Would you pay me back in cash?” “To pay someone back” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to  return the money that you borrowed from someone else. If I loan you $100, I e xpect you to pay me back – to give that money back to me in the future. Ken as ks if Petra is going to pay him back “in cash” – that is, in paper money.

Petra says, “Of course. I will write you an IOU rig ht now and then go to the bank tomorrow.” An “IOU” is a piece of paper, usually, w ith the three letters I, O, and U. “IOU” means “I owe (owe) you (you)” money. It’s a way of indicating that you have borrowed money from someone and that you are p romising to pay it back. That’s not the same, of course, as getting the mone y back in cash, which is what Ken wants.

Ken says, “How about if you go to the bank now. I’l l even give you a ride.” Ken says to Petra, “I will drive you to the bank so you  can get this money for me and give it to me right now instead of waiting until to morrow.” Petra says, “Is that really necessary? We don’t even know if it’s going to work.” Petra doesn’t think it’s necessary that they go and get the money right  away. Ken says, “When it comes to money,” meaning when we’re talking about o r dealing with money, “I always say ‘better safe than sorry.’”

This is an old expression, “better safe (safe) than  sorry (sorry).” This expression means that it is better to spend some extra time an d do something so that you don’t hurt yourself or take any unnecessary risks, because if you don’t take that extra time – if you are not safe – then later you c ould be sorry. You could get hurt, and therefore you will be not very happy. So,  it’s better to be cautious. It’s better to be safe – to move slowly, to do things ve ry carefully – rather than moving quickly or carelessly and getting hurt or ge tting injured.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
