This episode is a dialogue between Paul and Della a bout vocabulary related to crimes, especially old crimes. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paul: What are you watching?

Della: I’m watching a really good show about cold c ases. They take unsolved crimes from decades ago and reconstruct them, tryin g to solve them once and for all.

Paul: But after all this time, isn’t the trail cold ? How do they solve the crimes with no new leads?

Della: They go over the witness testimony and use s cientific methods that didn’t exist many years ago.

Paul: Isn’t there a statute of limitations for most  crimes?

Della: Yes, but not for murder.

Paul: I really doubt a TV show can solve crimes tha t the police couldn’t crack. Are any crimes really ever solved on the show?

Della: Yes, of course.

Paul: How? Through crack investigative methods or a  keen eye for detail?

Della: Deathbed confessions.

Paul: Ah.

Paul begins our dialogue by asking Della, “What are  you watching?” Presumably – we can guess, that is, that Della is watching tel evision. Della says, “I’m watching a really good show about cold cases.” A “c old case” is a criminal investigation that has not been solved and is not, at this time, trying to be solved by the police department. The police may investigat e a crime for many months, sometimes even many years, and then they say, “Okay , there’s no sense trying to find out who did this because we haven’t been ab le to find out so far.” This crime then becomes a “cold case” – a cold investiga tion. It’s “cold” because it’s so old. Maybe that’s why I feel cold more often now  than I used to.

Well, Della is watching a television show about cri me, about cold cases. She says, “They take unsolved crimes from decades ago a nd reconstruct them.” “To solve (solve) a crime” is to figure out who is resp onsible for the crime – who “committed” the crime, we would say. “To solve a cr ime” is to find the person who is guilty of the crime. An “unsolved case” or an “u nsolved crime” is one where the police have not figured out who the guilty person i s. “Cold cases” are always unsolved crimes. Della says these that are being di scussed on the television show are “from decades ago.”

A “decade” (decade) is a period of 10 years. So, “s everal decades ago” would mean 20, 30, 40, maybe even 50 years ago – a long t ime ago. “To reconstruct” something is to build it again. “To construct” is t o build something, to assemble something. “To reconstruct” would be to take someth ing that has perhaps fallen apart and build it again. However, here the verb re ally means to try to figure out everything that happened that is related to the cri me. “To reconstruct a crime” would be to try to figure out exactly who committed  the crime and all the different circumstances surrounding the crime.

The television show tries to solve these unsolved c rimes “once and for all.” “Once and for all” is a phrase meaning that once you do it, you won’t have to do it again. It’s the last time you’ll have to look at this issu e or try to do this thing. It will be completed. It will be finished.

Paul says, “But after all this time, isn’t the trai l cold?” A “trail” (trail), in this case, leads to a series of clues that are used to try to solve a crime. A “clue” (clue) is evidence that indicates the answer to a problem or the solution to a problem. Paul is saying that the trail is cold on these cold  cases, meaning it’s very difficult to try to follow the clues to figure out where the evidence is leading you.

 He says, “How do they solve the crimes with no new leads?” A “lead” (lead) is the same as a clue. It’s a piece of information that gi ves you some idea about what happened, that helps you solve the mystery or the c rime. Della says, “They go over the witness testimony and use scientific metho ds that didn’t exist many years ago.” A “witness” (witness) is someone who se es something, often something that is criminal or something that has go ne wrong.

You could also have a witness, however, to – for ex ample – your marriage. In the United States, in most places, if you get married, you have to sign an official government document, and there needs to be at least  two people who witness you sign the document who say, “Yes, this person si gned the document.” That’s also, of course, something that can go wrong – that  is to say, getting married. But normally, a “witness” is someone who sees a crime o r sees something bad happen.

“Testimony” (testimony) is a statement or statement s that someone makes about what happened, about what they know about a certain  topic. “Witness testimony” would be information that was provided by witnesses  to some crime, about what they saw or what they heard or what they know.

Della also says the television show uses “scientifi c methods.” “Scientific methods” would be techniques, or ways of doing some thing, that would help you figure out who committed the crime – using, perhaps , some special analysis. Perhaps chemicals or some sort of laboratory analys is that would help you figure out who the criminal was. A lot of times, especiall y nowadays, there is DNA evidence, genetic evidence that is left at the plac e where the crime was committed – what we call the “scene (scene) of the crime.” Sometimes those kinds of methods can be used to solve old criminal cases as well.

Paul says, “Isn’t there a statute of limitations for most crimes?” A “statute” (statute) is the same as a law. “Statute of limitat ions” refers to a law that says that if you are not caught for a crime – if the pol ice do not catch you for crime after a certain number of years – then you cannot b e arrested. So, if you do something wrong that isn’t very serious, and the po lice don’t find out about it until many years later, usually they can’t do anything ab out it because the statute of limitations says the police have only so many years  to find people guilty of these kinds of crimes.

“Murder,” however – when you kill someone – typical ly does not have any statute of limitations placed on it. That is, it doesn’t ma tter how long ago it was, the police can still arrest you and put you in prison. That’s what Della says here –

that for murder there is not a statute of limitatio ns. Paul says, “I really doubt a TV show can solve crimes that the police couldn’t crac k.” Paul doesn’t think the TV shows can figure out who the criminal was if the po lice couldn’t figure it out. The verb “to crack” (crack) means to solve a difficult problem – especially, to solve a crime.

Paul then asked Della, “Are any crimes really ever solved on the show?” Della says, “Yes, of course.” Paul asks, “How? “Through c rack investigative methods or a keen eye to detail?” “Investigative methods” w ould be ways that you try to get information about something – in this case, abo ut who committed the crime. “Crack” (crack) here is used as an adjective. Just a second ago, we used it as a verb meaning to solve a crime.

As an adjective, “crack” can mean very sharp, very smart, very good at what you are doing. “I am a crack basketball player.” I can play basketball better than anyone else in my house – better than my wife, that  is. That is one possible way of using “crack” as an adjective. “Crack investigat ive methods” would be very intelligent or smart ways of investigating a crime.  “A keen eye for detail” means the ability to notice small things that other peopl e perhaps would not notice. “A keen eye for detail” is the ability to see things t hat others cannot see.

Paul is asking if these are the ways that the telev ision show solves crimes. However, Della says that that’s not how they solve the crimes when they do solve crimes. They do it, according to Della, by us ing “deathbed confessions.” A “confession” is a statement admitting that you did something wrong. Sometimes, when the police catch a person who committed the cr ime, the person will just confess. They will say, “Okay, yes, I did it.” “Con fession” comes from the verb “to confess” (confess).

A “deathbed confession” is when you admit to doing something wrong as you are dying. Your “deathbed” is literally the place, the bed, where you are lying as you are dying, and right before you die, you say, “Oh, yes. I murdered this person,” or “I did this terrible thing many years ago.” Of cour se, it doesn’t take any investigative work by the police if someone confess es to a crime, and Della is saying here that this television show doesn’t reall y solve any crimes unless someone has confessed to them.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
