This episode is a dialogue between Colleen and Jerr y about predicting the weather. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Colleen:  Shh! I want to hear the weather forecast for this week.

Jerry:  What’s so important about this week?

Colleen:  Shh!

Radio Announcer:  Tomorrow, this warm front will mo ve out and a cold front will move in, bringing with it windy conditions with a c hance of thunderstorms.

Colleen:  Yeah!

Radio Announcer:  On Tuesday, things will clear up in the morning and we’ll have sunny skies...

Colleen:  Uh!

Radio Announcer:  But it will be chilly in the afte rnoon and the skies will be overcast. There’ll be a chance of precipitation in the evening, with very high levels of humidity.

Colleen:  Yeah!

 Radio Announcer:  On Friday, the temperature will d rop sharply and we’ll be lucky if we reach 20 degrees.

Colleen:  Oh, yeah!

Jerry:  What was all that about?

Colleen:  If the weather is nice this weekend, my i n-laws plan to drive up to spend a few days at our house.

Jerry:  [laughs] Oh, I see.

Colleen and Jerry are listening to the radio. Colle en says to Jerry, “Shh!” This is when you want someone to be quiet, of course. You g o “Shh!” “I want to hear the weather forecast for this week.” The “weather forec ast” is a prediction about what the weather will be like tomorrow, the day after to morrow, the day after that, the entire week, usually for (maybe) five to seven days  in advance.

Jerry says, “What's so important about this week?” But Colleen doesn’t answer him. She just says, “Shh, ” telling him to be quiet , to stop talking. My wife does that to me a lot, too. Maybe I'm talking too much –  no, no, it can't be possible.

The radio announcer says, “Tomorrow, this warm fron t will move out and a cold front will move in.” A warm “front” (front) is a la rge area of warm air that moves toward another area with cold air. So, when we're t alking about the weather, a warm front would bring warmer temperatures to where  you are living. A cold front is the opposite. A cold front is a large amount of cold air that moves into a certain area or place. The radio announcer says that the cold front is “moving in.” In other words, that’s what's coming in the future. the warm front is “moving out” – it’s going away. This means the temperatures will b e colder. It also means, the radio announcer says, that there will be windy cond itions with a chance of thunderstorms. “Windy” (windy) is when the air move s very quickly, when the air moves at very high speeds. “Thunderstorms” is a wea ther event where there are lots of dark clouds and rain and lightning (which a re flashes of light) in the sky and thunder. “Thunder” is that low noise that you h ear after you see the lightning – that’s a thunderstorm. Where I grew up in Minneso ta, there are lots of thunderstorms in the summertime. In fact, I was bac k visiting not too long ago and there was a thunderstorm the first day I came. Maybe they were trying to tell something, like I shouldn’t go back to Minnesota to  visit? I don’t know.

 Colleen, after hearing the radio announcer’s foreca st, says, “Yeah!” She’s happy, which is kind of strange that you're happy if there 's going to be thunderstorms. The radio announcer continues, “On Tuesday, things will clear up in the morning and we'll have sunny skies.” To “clear up” is a two -word phrasal verb that here means for the clouds to go away. So, instead of hav ing clouds in the sky, it becomes sunny. Normally that would be a good thing.  Sunny is when you have lots of sunshine, when you can see the sun.

But Colleen says, “Uh!” She seems disappointed at t his news, again, a little strange. The radio announcer continues, “But it wil l be chilly in the afternoon and the skies will be overcast. “Chilly” (chilly) is an  adjective meaning cool or cold, not warm. “It's a little chilly outside” usually means it's not cold. It's not so cold you're going to freeze, but you might need a jacket or a s weater, something to keep you warm. “Chile” (Chile) is – well, it's a country in South America, and “chili” (chili) is a food that you can eat. You can eat chilly chili i n Chile. We used to say stuff like that when we were kids, same pronunciation, three d ifferent spellings. Isn't English wonderful?

The radio announcer continues that the skies will b e overcast. “Overcast” (overcast) means there are lots of clouds in the sk y, usually gray clouds. It's not sunny. It's not thunderstorms. It's not raining usu ally, but when we say it's overcast, we mean it's cloudy. There isn't a lot of  sunshine. The announcer says, “There’ll be a chance of precipitation in the eveni ng with very high levels of humidity.” “Precipitation” is just another word for  liquid coming from the sky, either rain or snow or some sort of liquid that is falling out of the clouds. That’s precipitation. In the United States, when you are l istening to a weather forecast, they may talk about how much precipitation there wa s and that will be measured in inches. So, they might say, “We had an inch of r ain last night.” That means that if you put a little glass outside and you let the water fall in it, there would have been one, approximately one inch of water that  would have fallen. That’s how we measure precipitation in English – well, in the United States we use inches, of course.

The announcer also says there's going to be high le vels or a lot of humidity. “Humidity” (humidity) is a way of measuring the wat er that’s in the air before it comes to the ground. It's really an expression of w hat we call “water vapor” in the air. If it's very humid out, for example you're in Florida in the summertime or in the Caribbean or by the ocean and it's very hot, th ere's often a lot of humidity. It feels like there's water in the air even when it's not raining. Colleen is happy with the forecast of precipitation and high humidity.

The radio announcer then continues, “On Friday, the  temperature will drop sharply and we'll be lucky if we reach 20 degrees.”  The “temperature,” of course, is a measurement of how hot or cold something is. I n the United States, we use the Fahrenheit scale. In most other places in the w orld, the Celsius scale is used. When we say something will “drop,” we mean it will decrease. “Sharply” means suddenly and dramatically – a long way. When we say  the “temperature will drop sharply,” we mean maybe 50 degrees this morning and  then this afternoon it will be only 30 degrees or 20 degrees. That would be to drop sharply. Sharply has a couple of other meanings in English; take a look at  our Learning Guide for those. The announcer says, “We’ll be lucky if we reach 20 degrees.” “To reach” means for the temperature to get up to a certain point, i n this case 20 degrees. Degrees, of course, is the way that we measure, the unit tha t we measure and express temperature, both in Fahrenheit and Celsius. Collee n again is happy. She says, “Oh, yeah!”

Jerry says, “What was all that about?” Why were you  getting happy, basically, when the weather was going to be bad or the forecas t said it was going to be bad? Colleen says, “If the weather is nice this wee kend, my in-laws plan to drive up to spend a few days at our house.” My “in-laws” are either your father-in-law or your mother-in-law, usually both of them. They'r e the father and mother of your husband or your wife, the parents of your spouse. S o, if you're married, you have in-laws. You have a father-in-law and a mother-in-l aw. I have a father-in-law and a mother-in-law. My wife has a father-in-law and a mother-in-law. Those are my parents. And of course, my in-laws are her parents.  I can make a lot of joke about in-laws at this point, but I won't.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
