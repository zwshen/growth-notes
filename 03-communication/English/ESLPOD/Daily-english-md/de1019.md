On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Nina and Serge about losing your passport while you are traveling.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nina: Oh, my God! I can’t find my passport. I never  should have put it in my purse. I’m sure a pickpocket took it.

Serge: Calm down. Maybe you just misplaced it. Let’ s turn out all of your pockets and search for it before we panic.

Nina: I know it’s gone. I know it! Flag down the po lice. We have to file a police report.

Serge: If your passport has been stolen, we need to  find the U.S. embassy.

Nina: We’re supposed to continue on to the next cou ntry on our tour tomorrow. We’re going to get left behind!

Serge: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. If we need  to find a U.S. embassy and apply for a temporary passport, we’ll do that.

Nina: It’s Saturday! We won’t get any help at the e mbassy until Monday. We’ll be stuck here.

Serge: It’ll take as long as it takes. Now, let’s s earch through all of your belongings before we do anything else.

Nina: I just thought of something.

 Serge: What?

Nina: I think I may have left it in the hotel room.

Serge: You think you may have left it in the hotel room.

Nina: Isn’t that good news? All that worry for noth ing.

Serge: Let’s not count our chickens. You might have  another inspiration.

Our dialogue begins with Nina saying to Serge, “Oh,  my God! I can’t find my passport.” Your “passport” (passport) is your offic ial identifying document that is given to you by the country in which you are a citi zen. Typically, you have to be a citizen or an official member of the country in ord er to get a passport. Sometimes, in some countries, you can have more tha n one passport if you are a citizen of more than one country.

Nina says that she can’t find her passport. She say s, “I never should have put it in my purse.” She’s regretting putting it in her pu rse. She’s saying, “I wish I had not done that.” She continues, “I’m sure a pickpock et took it.” A “pickpocket” (pickpocket) is a person who steals your money or y our wallet from either your pants or shirt or a bag that you are carrying. Pick pockets are common in almost every city in the world, certainly cities that have  a lot of tourists. These are thieves that are able to take things from people.

Sometimes they’re very good. They’re very sophistic ated in what they do. You don’t even realize that they have stolen something from you. The reason we call them “pickpockets” is because a “pocket” is a pouch  or a internal bag, if you will, inside of either a shirt or your pants where you ke ep things, where you hold things. “To pick” here means to take, to take out o f, or really, to steal. Interestingly, we also use that same verb “to pick”  when we are talking about someone who opens a lock without the key, something  a thief would also do.

Serge says, “Calm down. Maybe you just misplaced it .” “To misplace” something is to accidentally put something somewhere without realizing or remembering where you put it. This happens to me all the time. Maybe I’m just getting old. Serge says, “Let’s turn out all of your pockets and  search for it before we panic.” “To turn out your pockets” means to take the pocket , the material of which the pocket is made, and pull it out of your pants – to basically turn it inside out, to

take the inner part and bring it to the exterior. T hat’s “to turn out,” in this case, “your pockets.”

My mother used to tell me before I gave her my dirt y clothes to wash to turn out the pockets. In other words, take my hand and put i t inside of the pocket and pull it out. She, of course, didn’t want any paper or co ins in there when she put it into the clothes washer. And you can imagine, with a fam ily of 13, we had a lot of clothes to wash.

Anyway, Serge doesn’t want to panic. “To panic” (pa nic) means to get very worried and perhaps fearful about something. Usuall y this happens quite suddenly, and it causes you often not to think very  clearly or very logically. Nina says, “I know it’s gone. I know it! Flag down the p olice,” she says. “To flag down” someone is to get someone’s attention, usually by r aising your arm and moving it back and forth, moving your hand back and forth, so  that you get the attention of someone. We usually use this two-word phrasal verb when talking about getting the attention of a police officer or perhaps a taxi  driver.

Serge is trying to help Nina, but Nina thinks that she has definitely lost her passport and wants him to get the police. She says,  “We have to file a police report.” “To file (file) a police report” is to off icially report a crime, to go to the police and say, “Someone has committed a crime” – s omeone has done something wrong and I want you to know about it. the police then usually take your information, writing it down on a piece of pap er or putting it into their computers, and then when you leave, they go back an d have coffee and donuts and forget all about you. No, I’m kidding, of cours e, mostly.

Serge says, “If your passport has been stolen, we n eed to find the U.S. Embassy.” We’re assuming of course that Nina and Se rge are in another country. That’s usually the only time you would tak e your passport with you. An “embassy” (embassy) is the official building where the official representative from a country, called the “ambassador,” would work. Acc ording to international law, embassies are really property of the country which they represent, although that doesn’t always work out so well.

If you are traveling in another country and you los e your passport, you do in fact have to go to an embassy. Sometimes, if it’s a big country, the embassy will have smaller offices in different parts of that country.  These are called “consulates.” Nina says, “We’re supposed to continue on to the ne xt country on our tour tomorrow.” So, Serge and Nina are traveling on a to ur, and they’re supposed to leave the country they are in now tomorrow. “We’re going to get left behind,” Nina says. “To be left behind” means to be unable to go with the rest of the group as it

advances or progresses or moves forward, in this ca se, as it goes to another country.

“To leave behind” is it common phrasal verb. There was a law a few years ago called “No Child Left Behind.” The idea was that yo u wouldn’t want to leave schoolchildren, some schoolchildren, behind others in terms of their academic achievement, and this was a program that was suppos ed to help American students. I’m not sure if it did, but that was the idea. They spent a lot of money on it, though. I can I can tell you that.

Anyway, Serge says, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselv es.” “To get ahead of yourself” is to do something sooner than you should  or sooner than you need to do it. Often we use this expression when someone is  worrying about something that might happen in the future even though it’s to o soon, really, to think about that particular event. Nina is already worrying abo ut being left behind on their tour even before they’ve had a chance to look prope rly for the passport. That’s why Serge says, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. If we need to find a U.S. embassy and apply for a temporary passport, we’ll d o that.” “Temporary” means for a short time – not permanent.

Nina says, “It’s Saturday. We won’t get any help at  the embassy until Monday. We’ll be stuck here.” “To be stuck” (stuck) somewhe re is to be unable to move – not to be able to leave a place. Sometimes we use t his expression when we are having difficulty with some task, and we can’t seem  to move forward or to progress on it. “I’m stuck on this math problem” – I need to find the answer before I can go on to the next problem.

Serge says, “It takes as long as it takes.” This is  a common expression nowadays also. “It takes as long as it takes” is a phrase that we use when you don’t really know how long something is going to ta ke, but you just have to accept it. There’s nothing you can do about it. A v ariation on this expression is, “It is what it is,” which means “This is the situation. ” You can’t change it. That’s just the way it’s going to be, so we’re going to have to  accept it and do what we can under these perhaps difficult circumstances.

Serge says, “Let’s search through all of your belon gings before we do anything else.” Serge once again is trying to get Nina to lo ok again for her passport in her belongings. Your “belongings” (belongings) – always  plural – are your possessions, things that you own: your suitcase, yo ur clothing, your purse, and so forth. Nina says, “I just thought of something.”  Serge says, “What?” “I think I may have left it in the hotel room,” Nina says. Ser ge says, “You think you may have left it in the hotel room.” He’s, I don’t know , relieved or upset.

 Nina says, “Isn’t that good news? All that worrying  for nothing.” The expression “for nothing” means for no purpose, without any goo d reason. Serge says, “Let’s not count our chickens.” “To count your chickens” i s actually a shortened form of a longer expression, which is “to count your chicke ns before they’re hatched (hatched).”

When a chicken lays an egg – when the egg comes out  of her body – the chicken inside of the egg (the embryo) will develop, and wh en it’s ready to come out of the egg, it will break out of the shell. We call th at process “hatching,” when the chicken is now outside of the eggshell and able to walk around and do whatever chickens do. The expression means that you shouldn’ t depend on something before it actually happens. You shouldn’t count on something. “To count on” something means to rely on it, to depend on it.

The expression, however, is using another version o f, or another meaning of, the verb “to count,” which means actually to put a numb er on something: one, two, three, four, five, six – that’s to count. You don’t  want to count your chickens before they’re hatched because you don’t know if so me of the eggs will actually hatch, and therefore you shouldn’t say, “Oh, yeah, I have 10 chickens” until all 10 eggs have hatched and you can actually count the li ve chickens. That’s the idea.

Serge finally says, “You might have another inspira tion.” An “inspiration” is an idea – usually a new idea, a creative idea, about s omething. Nina’s inspiration is that she left the passport in her hotel room, but S erge isn’t so sure, so confident, and that’s why he says, “Let’s not count our chicke ns.” Let’s not think that the problem has been solved before we actually solve it .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
