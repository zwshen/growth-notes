# Describing Poor Audio Quality

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,280 – Describing Poor Audio Quality.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,280. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Young and Silvia  about listening to something that is not recorded very well – that has  poor audio quality. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Young: We have a major problem. The audio on the ne w presentation is really awful.

Silvia: Really? Let me listen to it. Oh, the volume  fluctuates and keeps cutting out. We even have long periods of dead air!

Young: That’s only one of the many problems. Keep l istening and you’ll hear lots of static in the background. Sometimes it’s so loud  that it drowns out all other sounds.

Silvia: Oh no, the voices are distorted, too. Some speakers sound garbled and others sound muffled.

Young: And when you can make out what the speakers are saying, their voices are tinny.

Silvia: What are we going to do?

Young: I guess we can try to remaster it and see if  we can make any improvements.

Silvia: What if we can’t?

Young: Worse comes to worst? We’ll use captions!

Young begins our dialogue by saying to Silvia, “We have a major problem.” “Major” (major) means a big or important problem. Y oung says, “The audio on the new presentation is really awful” – is really b ad, or terrible. “Audio” (audio) is sound that you hear that is recorded or copied. Usu ally it is recorded on some sort of electronic device. Most movies have “video”  (video) as well as “audio.” “Video” is what you can see, what is recorded visua lly. “Audio” is what you can hear.

A “presentation” (presentation) is usually some inf ormation that is given to someone that includes both sound and visual informa tion. A presentation at your office, where you work, might be someone standing u p in front of you and talking about information, giving you information and showi ng you things. That’s a “presentation.” “The audio on the new presentation, ” according to Young, “is really awful.” Silvia says, “Really?” She’s surpris ed. She then says, “Let me listen to it.” “Oh,” she says, “the volume fluctuates and keeps cutting out.” The “volume” (volume) of something is how loud it is. It is a me asure of how much sound is being produced, we could say.

We talk about a “high volume” and a “low volume.” S omething that is on “low volume” is not very loud. If you want to increase t he volume, we would use the phrasal verb “turn it up” or “turn up the volume.” “To turn up the volume” means to increase the volume, to make something louder. T he opposite would be “to turn down (down) the volume.” Here, the volume “flu ctuates” (fluctuates). “To fluctuate” means to vary – to increase and then dec rease, but not in a constant or steady way, to go up and down unpredictably.

The phrasal verb “to cut (cut) out” can mean simply  to stop, but here it means for the sound to stop temporarily and then to begin aga in. If someone says the audio is “cutting out,” he means you can hear it and then  suddenly you can’t hear it, and then you can hear it again. You know, what happ ens sometimes when you are listening to your music through your headphones  or your earbuds on your phone, and suddenly you can’t hear the music, and t hen you can hear the music. That’s usually because you have a bad connection, p erhaps. The wire is bad. That’s what we mean by audio “cutting out.”

Silvia says, “We even have long periods,” or long a mounts of time, “of dead (dead) air (air).” “Dead air” is usually a phrase w e associate with television or radio, when there is suddenly no sound. You can’t h ear anything. That is usually because there is some technical problem at the radi o station. Well, in this presentation, which was recorded electronically, th ere are times when there is dead air – and that of course is not good.

Young says, “That’s only one of the many problems. Keep listening and you’ll hear lots of static in the background.” “Static” (s tatic) is noise in a recording that you don’t want there. Here’s an example of static t hat, if you’re old enough to remember, you might have heard on what we used to c all a “record player,” something that played old vinyl albums. Listen. [st atic] That’s an example of static. There is static, Young says, “in the backgr ound” (background).

The “background” is what you hear in addition to the person talking on the audio. It’s the other noise in the room, or other noise th at is present in addition to the person talking, or perhaps the music that is being played. Young says, “Sometimes it” – meaning the static – “is so loud t hat it drowns out the other sounds.” “To drown (drown) out” is a two-word phras al verb meaning for the noise or the sound to be louder than something else  so that you can’t hear what you want to hear.

If I’m talking to you and suddenly there’s a big mo torcycle that drives by and makes a lot of noise, if that noise is very loud, i t might drown me out. You won’t be able to hear me because the noise of the motorcy cle is too loud. My neighbor likes to sing to himself sometimes, very loudly, an d that sometimes drowns out my television that I am listening to, so I have to turn my television volume up, and then he sings louder, and then I turn my television  up even louder. You get the idea.

Silvia says, “Oh no, the voices are distorted, too. ” “To be distorted” (distorted) means to be difficult to hear or to understand, usu ally because there is some problem with the recording or because the device yo u are listening to has a problem. A voice that is “distorted” might be one t hat is suddenly very high or very low. This would be an example of a distorted v oice. That’s really bad distortion. I apologize for that.

Silvia continues, “Some speakers,” meaning some of the people who are talking, “sound garbled and others sound muffled.” If someon e sounds “garbled” (garbled), he is difficult to understand. It’s simi lar to “distorted.” “Muffled” (muffled) is when sound is not loud enough, perhaps  because someone is covering the microphone or someone is not speaking very clearly. Young says, “And when you can make out what the speakers are sa ying, their voices are tinny.”

“To make (make) out what someone is saying” means t o be able to understand what the other person is saying. We also use this p hrasal verb when we are trying to read something that is very difficult bec ause it isn’t written very clearly – maybe it was written with a pencil and it’s hard to  read. “I can’t make out what

this says.” I can’t understand it. Young also compl ains that some of the people in the recording have voices that sound “tinny” (tinny ). If you have a “tinny” voice, it’s very high-pitched or difficult to understand. Well, that’s even more than tinny.

Silvia then says, “What are we going to do?” Young says, “I guess we can try to remaster it and see if we can make any improvements .” “To remaster” (remaster) is to use technology to improve the quality of soun d that was recorded before, or often many years ago. Sometimes movie studios here in Los Angeles, movie companies, will “remaster” old movies, trying to im prove the sound and the way they look. We usually use this term, however, to re fer to improving the audio quality of something.

Silvia asks, “What if we can’t?” meaning what if we  cannot remaster the audio to make it sound better. Young says, “Worse comes to w orst? We’ll use captions.” The expression “worse (worse) comes to worst (worst )” is used to mean or describe a bad situation that gets even worse, that  becomes as bad as possible. Young says in the worst situation, “We’ll use capti ons” (captions). “Captions” are when you have the words to what you are watching on  the screen.

Captions are used in television and sometimes in mo vies when a person is difficult to understand, and so you put the words o f what that person is saying on the bottom of the screen so that you can read them as well as listen to them. Watching programs, television shows, that are “capt ioned” in the language of the show – that is, not translated, but actually the sa me words that are being spoken by the person on the show or in the movie – is actu ally a very good way of improving your English. There’s some good scientifi c research about that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
