This episode is an episode about listening to motiv ational speakers – people who try to motivate you or to get you to do something t hat perhaps you don't want to do, like listening to motivational speakers. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Jamal: I really dread these annual management meeti ngs. We usually have to sit through the most boring motivational speakers givin g us pep talks. 

Cindy: I think you’ll be surprised by the person th ey’ve hired to kick off our meeting. She’s supposed to be a guru on crisis mana gement. 

Jamal: Oh no, not another one. 

Cindy: This one has a lot of real-world experience.  She was a fighter pilot who has apparently survived some very difficult mission s. 

Jamal: What does a fighter pilot know about busines s? I can’t believe our company is shelling out thousands of dollars on spe aking fees for someone like her to tell us how to do our jobs better. 

Cindy: I think that the idea is to understand how o ther organizations and professions handle crises, which may shed some ligh t on how we can do things better. 

Jamal: Well, I don’t have high hopes. 

Cindy: Don’t you think she can teach us anything?  

 Jamal: Sure, in fact our speaker has inspired me to  try to get on the lecture circuit myself. 

Cindy: What would you speak about? 

Jamal: Avoiding corporate waste! 

[end of dialogue] 

Jamal begins our dialogue by saying to Cindy, “I re ally dread these annual management meetings.” “To dread” (dread) means to n ot be excited about something. It's the opposite of “looking forward to ” something. “To dread” something is not to look forward to it. “Management  meetings” are meetings that are attended by, or that have as their participants , people who are managers, executives, bosses in a company. The “management” o f a company refers to the people who run the company – the bosses and executi ves.  

Jamal says, “We usually have to sit through the mos t boring motivational speakers giving us pep talks.” “To sit through” som ething is a phrasal verb meaning to go somewhere where you have to stay, but  it isn't very pleasant. We might also use the verb, here, “to endure” (endure) . “To endure” or “to sit through” something is to go somewhere and have to l isten to things that you, perhaps, are not very interested in. You might have  to sit through a really bad movie if your husband or wife wants you to go, and you really don't want to go, but you say, “Okay, I’ll go,” and then you have to sit through this terrible movie about people dying and, well, that’s just an exampl e – not something from my own life. 

“Pep talks” (pep talks) – two words – are informal speeches that are given to people to make them happier, to make them more moti vated to want to do something. The people who often come to these large  meetings of managers and try to help people get motivated are called “motiva tional speakers.” “Motivational” comes from the verb “to motivate,” which as I've me ntioned means to get you to do something that you perhaps don't otherwise want to do. “Motivational speakers” became very popular in the middle part of  the twentieth century, at least in the United States, especially for these so rts of large business meetings where bosses were coming together to try to plan th e future of the company.  

Cindy says, “I think you'll be surprised by the per son they've hired to kick off our meeting.” Cindy is not as negative as Jamal is. She ’s saying that he'll be surprised by the person the company hired, or paid,  to come and “kick off our  

meeting.” “To kick off” something means to start or  to begin something, especially a long project or a large task that has to be accomplished. Cindy says, “She's supposed to be a guru on crisis management.”  A “guru” (guru) is someone who knows a lot about a certain topic, who is consi dered an expert. A “guru” is also a wise, spiritual person in certain religious traditions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. But here, it just means an expert – someo ne who knows a lot about a certain topic.  

This motivational speaker knows a lot about crisis management. A “crisis” (crisis) is a serious situation, maybe even a dangerous situ ation, that requires some immediate attention or immediate action. The word “ management” in the term “crisis management” doesn't refer to the people who  run a company, but rather to the process of taking care of and solving whatever problem is causing, in this case, a crisis. Jamal says, “Oh no, not another one .” He still isn't very happy about this motivational speaker.  

Cindy says, “This one” – this speaker – “has a lot of real-world experience.” The term “real- (real) world (world)” refers to things that people actually do – that people do “in real life,” we might say. The term is  used to contrast with learning or experience that comes from reading, or comes fro m not actually participating in a certain activity, but perhaps from simply obse rving it. You can learn things from books, and you can learn things from “real-lif e experiences” or “real-world experiences” – things that you actually have experi enced or participated in yourself. Cindy says that the motivational speaker “was a fighter pilot who has apparently survived some very difficult missions.”  

A “pilot” (pilot) is a person who flies a plane; a “fighter pilot” would be someone in the military who flies planes that shoot bullets or  drop bombs in some sort of military activity – a war, for example. This motiva tional speaker “was a fighter pilot who apparently survived some very difficult m issions.” A “mission” (mission), when referring to military activities, is a task th at has to be accomplished. For a fighter pilot, a mission might involve flying a hun dred miles and dropping a bomb and then coming back to the ship or the place where  the plane took off from. That might be a mission. The word “mission” can also mea n, more generally, the purpose for doing something – your reason for doing  something. 

Jamal says, “What does a fighter pilot know about b usiness? I can't believe our company is shelling out thousands of dollars on spe aking fees for someone like her to tell us how to do our jobs better.” Jamal is  not happy. He says he can't believe that the company “is shelling out thousands  of dollars.” “To shell (shell) out” money means to pay a lot of money for somethin g. This is a two-word phrasal verb that is often used when you think the money is being wasted, when  

you think the price is too high. “I don't want to s hell out $50,000 for a new car. That's too much money.” “Speaking fees” refer to th e money that you have to pay someone to come in and give a talk or a speech to y our group.  

So, Jamal is not happy the company is spending, or shelling out, “thousands of dollars on speaking fees.” Cindy says, “I think tha t the idea is to understand how other organizations and professions handle crises, which may shed some light on how we can do things better.” Cindy is saying that although this woman may not know anything about business, she understands how t o handle or manage a crisis. And “crises” happen in many different situa tions and in many different organizations.  

Cindy says that the fighter pilot’s experience migh t shed some light on how they do things in their company. “To shed (shed) light o n” something or “to shed some light on” something means to provide insight on a t opic, to help someone understand something better, to see it in a differe nt way. Jamal says, “Well, I don't have high hopes.” “High hopes” are high expec tations – when you think something is going to be really great. Jamal does n ot have high hopes.  

Cindy says, “Don't you think she can teach us anyth ing?” Jamal says, “Sure. In fact, our speaker has inspired me to try to get on the lecture circuit myself.” Jamal is saying that this woman is inspiring him or  giving him the idea – and, I guess, the motivation – to try to get on the lectur e circuit. The term “lecture” (lecture) refers to a speech when you go out and ed ucate someone or give a speech to a group of people to try to provide new i nformation to them. We also use this word at the university when a professor gi ves information to the students. We call that “giving a lecture,” or we ca n use it as a verb: “to lecture.”  

The “lecture circuit” (circuit) refers to a typical  schedule that you would have for a person who goes and gives lectures or presentations  at many different places, in many different organizations. In education, for exa mple, there are people who go around and give presentations to teachers in differ ent cities. Now, they don't all go to the same cities or to the same schools, but w e could refer to this activity of going around and giving presentations and talks to different groups of people in different parts of the country as being a “lecture circuit.”  

I was on the lecture circuit for a couple of years.  I would go around and give speeches and give presentations to English teachers  all around the United States. I did that for about three years. I would f ly to different cities and give presentations, sometimes 30 or 40 cities in a year.  So, I did a lot of traveling when I was younger. I'm glad I don't have to do tha t anymore. I travel now just via the Internet.   

 To finish our dialogue, Cindy says, “What would you  speak about?” She's asking Jamal what he would go and present on if he were to  be on the lecture circuit. Jamal says, “Avoiding corporate waste.” “Corporate”  (corporate) refers to a large company. “Waste” (waste) refers to money that is no t spent well, money that is lost on things that are not very productive or usef ul. “Corporate waste” will refer to money that a company spends that doesn't really give them very much benefit.  

Jamal thinks motivational speakers are a waste of m oney. So, he's going to go around to other companies as a motivational speaker  to tell them how much money they're wasting on motivational speakers. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
