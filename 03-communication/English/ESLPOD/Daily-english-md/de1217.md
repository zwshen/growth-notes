[start of dialogue]

Xavier: What crazy new creams are you trying this w eek?

Aaliyah: I’ll have you know I only use anti-aging p roducts that are scientifically proven.

Xavier: Yeah, like that cream that promised to rest ore your youthful appearance in just two weeks. When are you going to realize be auty products are sold using false claims and promises?

Aaliyah: What about you? You jump on the bandwagon of every health fad. Aren’t you eating a bunch of so-called superfoods?

Xavier: That’s based on science. The goal is longev ity.

Aaliyah: And this expensive new computer program?

Xavier: It’s to ward off dementia and Alzheimer’s. I’m keeping my mind active.

Aaliyah: So we’re both trying to fight the effects of aging.

Xavier: I guess that’s true, but I’m going to outli ve you.

Aaliyah: Yes, but before I kick the bucket, I’m going to look marvelous!

[end of dialogue]

Xavier says to Aaliyah, “What crazy new creams are you trying this week?” “Cream” (cream) is another word for “lotion” (lotio n). “Cream” or “lotion” is a very thick liquid that you put on your skin, either as m edicine because you have some problem with your skin, or to make your skin look m ore beautiful. Xavier is asking Aaliyah “what crazy new creams” she’s trying this w eek. The word “crazy” here probably just means unusual or strange or different .

Aaliyah responds, “I’ll have you know I only use an ti-aging products that are scientifically proven.” The phrase “I’ll have you k now” is used to present information to another person when you think that o ther person doubts you, or perhaps is attacking you, and you want the other pe rson to know the truth. You want to tell the other person that he is wrong to a ttack you.

Aaliyah believes that Xavier is criticizing her. Th at’s because he uses that word “crazy” new creams. Aaliyah says, “I’ll have you kn ow I only use anti-aging products that are scientifically proven.” “Anti-agi ng” refers to efforts to slow down or prevent the effects of getting older. Some compa nies sell certain creams or lotions that people can put on their skin that are supposed to prevent your skin from looking old, from looking as though you are ge tting old.

“Anti-aging” has become a popular commercial idea i n the U.S. as people are getting older, especially people my age who have mo ney to buy things that will, they think, prevent them from looking as old as the y really are. I don’t buy these products myself, but other people do and Aaliyah is  one of them. She only buys products that are “scientifically proven” – that is , for which there is some scientific research or scientific studies that show that this particular thing will actually help you.

Xavier doesn’t believe Aaliyah. He says, “Yeah, lik e that cream that promised to restore your youthful appearance in just two weeks. ” “To restore” (restore) is to return something to the way it was before, to retur n something to its previous condition. Xavier refers to a cream that Aaliyah bo ught that was supposed to restore her “youthful appearance.” “Youthful” (yout hful) refers to looking or feeling younger than you actually are.

Xavier says, “When are you going to realize beauty products are sold under false claims and promises.” Something that is “false” (fa lse) is something that is not true, a lie. A “claim” (claim) is when someone make s a statement about

something, when someone says something is true abou t a certain product or thing or person. A “false claim,” then, is the same  thing as a lie, a “false statement” – an untrue statement about something. X avier is saying that beauty products are sold using false claims, meaning the c ompanies say things that aren’t true.

Aaliyah says to Xavier, “What about you?” meaning y ou are doing some of the same things that you are telling me not to do. She continues, “You jump on the bandwagon of every health fad.” The expression “to jump on the bandwagon” (bandwagon) means to begin doing something that is popular among a lot of other people or to start doing something just becau se a lot of other people are doing it. A “fad” (fad) is something that becomes p opular very quickly, but lasts only a short period of time.

A common example of this would be certain popular d ances. Everyone starts doing this dance, and then six months later, nobody  is doing it. Here in the U.S. there are always dance fads. The “Macarena” from the 1990s would be an example of a “dance fad” – where everyone was danci ng it, and then two or three months later, no one was dancing it – or at least h ere in the U.S. So there are “dance fads.” There are “clothing fads.” There are all sorts of “fads” – things that become popular very quickly, but are only popular f or a short period of time.

Aaliyah says, “Aren’t you eating a bunch of so-call ed superfoods?” Aaliyah is criticizing Xavier for “jumping on the bandwagon” of a health fad. This health fad refers to eating “so-called superfoods.” A “superfo od” (superfood) is a food that is supposed to be very good for you, very healthy. You  may read in the paper about how blueberries are a “superfood.” They are suppose d to do all sorts of wonderful things for you if you eat them. Aaliyah c alls them not “superfoods” but “so-called super foods.”

The phrase “so-called” (called) is used to refer to  something when you don’t really approve of or like that name or term, or you  think it is somehow inappropriate or even wrong. “His so-called friend hit him on the head.” The term “so-called” is used there because your friend doesn ’t normally hit you on the head, so you would be sort of odd describing that p erson as a real friend. So you would say “his so-called friend.” Perhaps he though t that person was his friend. Aaliyah is referring to these foods as “so-called s uperfoods,” meaning she doesn’t really believe they are superfoods.

Xavier disagrees. He says, “That’s based on science . The goal is longevity.” “Longevity” (longevity) refers to the ability to li ve for a long time. So we find out that Xavier has been eating things so he can live f or a long time, and Aaliyah has

been putting things on her skin so it will look lik e she is not old. Remember, this episode is all about fighting the effects and signs  of aging – the things that will happen because you get old and indications that you  are getting old.

Aaliyah says to Xavier, “And this expensive new com puter program?” She’s asking about some new piece of software that Xavier  bought. Xavier says that the computer program is “to ward off dementia and A lzheimer’s.” “To ward (ward) off” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning t o prevent something so that it doesn’t cause damage, or to stop something from having negative effects on you.

The computer program is supposed to “ward off demen tia” (dementia). “Dementia” is when people have difficulty rememberi ng things. They may even have changes in their personality. These are condit ions that are sometimes associated with people getting very old, although n ot everyone who gets old has dementia. It’s when your mind begins to lose its me mory and perhaps change your behavior. “Alzheimer’s” is a disease that caus es a person’s brain to weaken over time. It also makes it more difficult to remem ber people, to remember facts, even to recognize people in your life.

Xavier thinks that this computer program will help “ward off” the effects of dementia and Alzheimer’s. He says, “I’m keeping my mind active.” “Active” (active) has a couple of different meanings. Here, it refers to someone actually doing something either with his body or with his mi nd. Xavier believes that if he keeps his mind active, if he keeps thinking about t hings and analyzing things, doing things with his brain, he will somehow be abl e to ward off the effects of old age.

Aaliyah then says, “So we’re both trying to fight t he effects of aging” – that is, we’re trying to stop the bad things that might happ en to us as we get older, both to our bodies and to our minds. Xavier says, “I gue ss that’s true, but I’m going to outlive you.” “To outlive” (outlive) someone is to live longer than another person. Women typically outlive men of the same age or who were born at the same time. We’re not sure if Xavier and Aaliyah are marr ied to each other, but from the way they talk to each other, it certainly sounds li ke it.

Aaliyah says, “Yes, but before I kick the bucket, I ’m going to look marvelous.” The phrase “to kick (kick) the bucket (bucket)” mea ns to die. It’s an informal expression meaning to die. If someone “kicks the bu cket,” someone has died. It’s sort of a funny phrase. You wouldn’t want to use it  to describe the death of someone close to you.

Aaliyah’s kind of making a joke. She’s saying that before she dies, before she kicks the bucket, she’s going to look “marvelous” ( marvelous). “Marvelous” means wonderful, very good. Aaliyah says she may di e before Xavier, but she’s going to look wonderful when she does, because of c ourse, she’s using all of this anti-aging cream on her skin.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
