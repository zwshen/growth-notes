This episode is a dialogue between George and Louis e.  It’s about having problems in your apartment and calling the person w ho’s responsible for fixing things in an apartment building, the super.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

George:  Did you call the super about fixing the le aky faucet? 

Louise:  I called him on Monday, but I haven’t hear d back yet.   

George:  Well, call him again.  This window is stuc k and it won’t close. 

Louise:  I’ll call him, but I think he’s avoiding o ur calls. 

George:  He’s the worst super we’ve ever had.  He’s  in charge of the maintenance around this place, but instead, he hide s out in his apartment. Whenever there’s a problem, he tells us he’s too bu sy to get to it right away.  Too busy doing what, I’d like to know. 

Louise:  Maybe he is overworked.  There are 25 unit s in this building, so it’s conceivable that he’s busy making repairs – somewhe re. 

George:  That’s what he’s counting on, people like you who give him the benefit of the doubt.  All the while he’s drinking coffee a nd reading the newspaper somewhere.  Mark my words. 

Louise:  I’ll call him again.  Maybe we’ll catch hi m in his apartment. 

George:  Save your energies.   

Louise:  Where are you going and what are you doing  with that baseball bat? 

George:  I’m going to track down that super and bri ng him back here.  Come hell or high water, he’s making those repairs – today! 

[end of dialogue] 

George begins our dialogue by asking Louise, “Did y ou call the super about fixing the leaky faucet?”  The word “super” is short for “ superintendent.”  A “superintendent,” in this case, is a person who is responsible for fixing any problems that you have in an apartment building.  S o if you have, as does George and Louise, a leaky faucet, you would call t his person and they would be responsible for fixing it or bringing someone in to  fix it.  A “faucet” is where the water comes out in a sink.  If it’s “leaky,” that m eans water is coming out slowly even when it’s not supposed to. 

Louise says that she called the super on Monday, bu t that she hasn’t heard back yet.  “To hear back from (someone)” means to receiv e a message back from someone that you have tried to contact.  Either you  sent an email, or you’ve written a letter, or you called someone.  They were  supposed to call you back, or write you back, and you have not yet gotten a respo nse.  You haven’t heard back yet.   

George says, “Well, call him again.  The window is stuck and it won’t close.”  The window won’t close down all the way, and that’s wha t George means when he says it’s stuck.  It could be stuck (stuck) open, m eaning you can’t close it, or it could be stuck closed, meaning you can’t open the w indow.  Louise says, “I’ll call him, but I think he’s avoiding our calls,” meaning he’s not answering his phone on purpose.  He’s doing it intentionally, we might say , because he doesn’t want to talk to us. 

George says, “He’s the worst super we’ve ever had.  He’s in charge of the maintenance around this place, but instead, he hide s out in his apartment.” “Maintenance” is the work that you need to keep som ething in good condition, or to make sure it doesn’t get worse than it is right now.  So in an apartment building, you might need to paint the walls every f ew years, or clean the carpets. You need to make sure the plumbing is working prope rly, the heating and/or air conditioning is working okay.  All of these things may require maintenance; you may have to do something to make sure they’re worki ng correctly.  George says that the super hides out in his apartment.  “To hid e (hide) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to spend your time where no on e else can see you.  It can mean, also, to be quiet, to remain hidden so that n o one can find you.  In this  

case, the super is hiding out in his apartment.  He ’s there and he doesn’t want anyone to know he’s there perhaps.  George says, “W henever there’s a problem, he tells us he’s too busy to get to it right away.”   If there’s a problem the super says, “Oh, no.  I’m sorry.  I’m busy.  I can’t do i t right now.  I can’t get to it,” meaning I can’t do what I need to do right now for that problem.  George says, “Too busy doing what, I’d like to know,” meaning wh at is he doing that makes him so busy.   

Louise says, “Maybe he is overworked.”  “Overworked ” means that you have too many things to do at your job; the boss has given y ou too much to do.  That’s how I feel; I feel overworked!  Louise says, “There  are 25 units in this building, so it’s conceivable he’s busy making repairs – somewhe re.”  A “unit” (unit) in this situation means an apartment or a condominium in a large building.  If there are 25 apartments in your building, we’d say there are 25 units; it’s the same thing. Louise says, “it’s conceivable (meaning it’s possib le, it’s not likely but it could be) that he’s busy making repairs (he’s busy fixing thi ngs) somewhere else.” 

George says, “That’s what he’s counting on.”  That’ s what he’s depending on, that’s what he’s relying on.  “He’s counting on peo ple like you who give him the benefit of the doubt.”  The expression “to give (so meone) the benefit of the doubt” means to assume the most positive thing when  you don’t have all the information about what is happening, especially whe n there’s a problem or you think there might be a problem.  So you call a plum ber to come over and fix something in your bathroom, and the plumber doesn’t  call you and they’re late. They’re supposed to be there at 9:00; it’s 10:00, 1 1:00, still no plumber.  The plumber doesn’t come; the plumber doesn’t call.  No w you could get angry, saying, “Oh, that terrible plumber.  He’s lazy,” or , “He’s not a very good business person.”  But, if you were to give him the benefit of the doubt you would think of another reason – a better excuse.  Maybe he got int o a car accident.  Maybe there was a lot of traffic on the freeway, and he f orgot his cell phone at home. Maybe he was appointed ambassador to Zimbabwe and i s busy in Washington meeting with the president.  You see there are all sorts of reasons why the plumber might not come on time.  That’s giving some one the benefit of the doubt. 

George says, “All the while (meaning at this time, while he is saying the same thing) he’s drinking coffee and reading the newspap er somewhere.”  So he’s not really busy; he’s just relaxing somewhere reading t he newspaper.  Then George says, “Mark my words.”  The expression “mark (mark)  my words” is used to emphasize that what you have just said – what you h ave just told another person will come true, to remember that in the future.  “M ark my words, the plumber went to a bar and got drunk.”  That’s what happened .  You’re saying that you  

don’t know that, probably, but that’s sort of your prediction.  You want the person that you’re talking to to remember what you’re sayi ng. 

Louise says, “I’ll call him again.  Maybe we’ll cat ch him in his apartment.”  “To catch (someone)” in this case means to find someone  before they leave, calling someone before they leave their apartment or before  they leave their office. “Catch” has a couple of different meanings in Engli sh; take a look at our Learning Guide for some of those.  George, however, says, “S ave your energies.”  “Save your energies” or “save your energy” is an informal  phrase used to tell someone not to do something because it won’t be necessary o r because it won’t really help the situation.   

Louise says, “Where are you going and what are you going to do with that baseball bat?”  A “baseball bat” is used in the gam e of baseball, of course, to hit the ball.  Some people keep baseball bats in their houses as a form of defense, as a weapon to protect themselves, to hit someone w ho may come in and try to steal something from your house.  It’s cheaper and less dangerous than a gun. 

Well, George says that he’s going to track down the  super and bring him back here.  “To track (track) (someone) down” means to f ind them, especially if it is difficult to find them.  Perhaps they’re hiding or they’re lost.  George says, “Come hell or high water, he’s making those repairs – tod ay!”  The expression “come hell or high water” is an old one, which means no m atter what happens, no matter how difficult the situation is I’m going to do this, or, in this case, I’m going to get the super to come back and fix the problems in the apartment no matter what – no matter what happens, come hell or high wa ter.  George, of course, is potentially going to use violence here; we might ha ve to have another dialogue called getting out of jail or prison after beating someone with a baseball bat!  I hope not. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

George:  Did you call the super about fixing the le aky faucet? 

Louise:  I called him on Monday, but I haven’t hear d back yet.
