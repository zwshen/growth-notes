This episode is a dialogue between Vanessa and Dani el about investigating the history of someone you may want to hire to work at your company. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Vanessa: I can’t wait until the new employees start  work. We need the help. 

Daniel: It won’t be for a while. Background checks have to be done first. 

Vanessa: Background checks? Are those really necess ary? 

Daniel: You’d be surprised. We’ve been burned befor e. We don’t want to hire anyone with prior instances of negligence or anyone  else who has been involved in a corporate scandal. Sometimes we even get peopl e with fraudulent credentials. 

Vanessa: Isn’t a background check kind of invasive?  What do they check for, a criminal record? 

Daniel: Yes, but that’s just the beginning. Investi gators check driving records, credit reports, school transcripts, sex offender li sts, and much more. 

Vanessa: I had no idea. 

Daniel: When someone runs your Social Security numb er, all kinds of things come up. Investigators also check court records and  medical records. 

Vanessa: That’s amazing. 

Daniel: On top of all that, they often speak with p ast employers and character references. 

Vanessa: And the new hires are okay with the compan y doing this kind of invasive background check? 

Daniel: You were. 

Vanessa: Me?! You mean they ran a background check on me before I was hired? 

Daniel: You bet.  

Vanessa: So they know all about . . . 

Daniel: What? 

Vanessa: Forget it.

Today’s episode is called “Conducting Employee Back ground Checks.” “To conduct” (conduct) here means to do, to carry out, a certain action. The action here relates to employees. An “employee” is someone  who works for a company. The person who owns the company is called the “empl oyer,” and the person who works for the employer is the “employee.” Vanessa b egins by saying, “I can’t wait until the new employees start work. We need help.” “I can’t wait” means I am looking forward to. I am hoping this time will come  soon.  

Daniel says, “It won’t be for a while,” meaning it will take some time. It won’t happen right away. He explains, “Background checks have to be done first.” A “background (background) check” is an investigation  of someone’s past, of what they have done in the past, especially making sure this person hasn’t committed any crimes, hasn’t been arrested by the police, or hasn’t done anything that would make the company not want to hire that person  or make that person an employee. Vanessa says, “Background checks? Are tho se really necessary?”  

Daniel responds, “You’d be surprised,” meaning “Yes , you would be surprised,” or “It would surprise you to know how necessary the y are.” He explains, “We’ve been burned before.” “To be burned” (burned) here m eans to have a bad experience, especially because you’ve trusted someo ne. If you trust someone to help you, or if you trust someone with some money –  you give someone some  

money thinking that person is going to give it back  to you – and then that person leaves with your money, we would say you were “burn ed.” You trusted a person and that person did not do what he said he would do . 

Daniel says, “We don’t want to hire anyone with pri or instances of negligence” (negligence). “Negligence” is not taking care of so mething the way you are supposed to. “Negligence” is when you don’t want to  do something wrong, but you’re not very careful, and because you’re not car eful, something bad happens. Daniel talks about not wanting to hire anyone with “prior (prior) instances of negligence.” “Prior instances” just means things th at happened in the past. The word “prior” means before now, or in the past. “Ins tances” just mean specific cases or times when certain things happened.  

Daniel says they also don’t want to hire anyone “wh o’s been involved in a corporate scandal.” “Corporate” (corporate) refers to a corporation, or a large company. A “scandal” (scandal) is when someone does  something wrong and it becomes public, and then people start talking about  it, giving the company perhaps a bad reputation. Daniel’s company doesn’t want to hire anyone who has been involved in a “corporate scandal.”  

“Sometimes,” he continues, “we even get people with  fraudulent credentials.” “Fraudulent” (fraudulent) means false, or not real.  “Credentials” (credentials) are things that show or demonstrate that you are qualif ied to do something. Credentials might include a certificate that shows you know how to do a certain job, or a degree from a university, or some other p roof that you are capable of doing what you say you are able to do.  

Vanessa asks, “Isn’t a background check kind of,” o r somewhat, “invasive (invasive)?” “Invasive” means finding out informati on about someone that you don’t really need to know or you shouldn’t know. “I nvasive” is sometimes defined as violating someone’s “privacy” (privacy). “Privac y” refers to things that are yours, that belong to you, or that are about you th at no one else has a right to know.  

Vanessa says, “What do they check for? A criminal r ecord?” A “criminal record” is proof that you have been arrested by the police – that you have broken the law and that you have been found guilty. In other words , the judge or the court said “Yes, you committed,” or did, “this crime.” Daniel says, “Yes” – they check for a criminal record – “but that’s just the beginning. I nvestigators,” people who look at someone’s background, “check,” or look at, “driving  records, credit reports, school transcripts, sex offender lists, and much mo re.”  

A background check, at least in some places in the United States or by some companies, could involve looking at things such as your “driving record.” This would be a report of whether you have ever speeded or have ever broken any traffic laws and been punished for it. It might als o involve “credit reports.” A “credit report” shows how much money you have borro wed, or whether you pay your credit cards on time, whether you have had any  bankruptcies – that is, if you’ve been unable to pay your bills in the past.  

A background check might also include “school trans cripts.” A “transcript” (transcript) is a record of all the classes or cour ses you took in school and what grade you got in those classes. A “sex offender (of fender) list” is a list of people living in a particular area who have been arrested and found guilty in the past of some sex crimes, such as rape or having sex with so meone who is not legally of age. In many places in the U.S., the government kee ps a list of where sex offenders live, and they are required after they ge t out of jail to tell the government where they are living and people can loo k at these lists and see if those people are living near you.  

I should mention that all of these things, such as driving records, credit reports, school transcripts (but not sex offender lists) wou ld require your permission. So, if you were going to work for a company, you would give the company permission. You would say, “Yes, I say it’s okay fo r you to look at all of these different records.” Typically, the companies can’t look at these things unless they ask you first and you say yes. Sex offender lists a re different. Those are public information.  

Vanessa said she had no idea, meaning she didn’t re alize this is what a background check could involve. Daniel continues, “ When someone runs your Social Security number, all sorts of things come up . Investigators also check court records and medical records.”  

Your “Social Security number” is a nine-digit numbe r, or nine numbers, assigned or given to each citizen of the United States that is used to identify you. Technically it’s supposed to be so that you can get  benefits when you are old and retire or need help from the government, but in fac t it’s a number that every U.S. citizen and even some non-citizens are given to ide ntify them, and you are asked for that number by the government or by companies i n order to identify you.  

Daniel refers to “running” someone’s Social Securit y number. “To run” here means simply to put that number into a computer to get information about a person. When you do that, according to Daniel, “all  kinds of things come up.” In  

other words, you can learn a lot about a person dep ending on which database or which source of information you use.  

He says, “Investigators can also check court record s and medical records.” “Court records” are reports about what an individua l has done in terms of the law – if a person has been arrested, or if a person has  tried to sue another person to get money from another person because the other per son hasn’t paid him, and so forth – anything involving the government and th e court system, judges, and so forth. Most of that information is public inform ation, except when it involves children who are not yet of legal age – who are les s than 18 years old.  

“Medical records” refer, of course, to what your do ctor knows about you – things that happen in a hospital and so forth. Medical rec ords are private, again, unless typically you give permission for someone to look a t them. Vanessa says, “That’s amazing.” She’s surprised at all of the things thes e background checks can learn about you. Daniel says, “On top of all that,” meaning in addit ion, “they often speak with past employers and character references.” “They” here re fers to the investigators.  

They may talk to the people you used to work for as  well as some friends and family who would be character references. A “charac ter (character) reference (reference)” is someone who has known you for a lon g time and can say if you are a good person morally or ethically, for example . For certain government jobs that involve security, you may have family members or friends who are interviewed by the government to make sure you’re n ot a spy, or that you are trustworthy and reliable. 

Vanessa says, “And the new hires are okay with the company doing this kind of invasive background check?” She’s asking if the peo ple who are going to be hired by the company, who are going to be employees , are okay with the company doing all of these checks. Daniel says, “Yo u were.” Vanessa is surprised. She’s surprised to learn that the compan y ran a background check on her. She says, “You mean they ran a background chec k on me before I was hired?”  

Daniel says, “You bet.” “You bet” is an informal wa y of saying yes, absolutely, that is correct. Vanessa says, “So they know all ab out . . .” She’s about to tell us perhaps something secret. And Daniel says, “What?” He wants to know what Vanessa is going to tell him, and she says, “Forget  it,” meaning don’t worry about it, or I don’t want to tell you anymore. Obviously,  she has perhaps some secret that the background check didn’t find.  

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
