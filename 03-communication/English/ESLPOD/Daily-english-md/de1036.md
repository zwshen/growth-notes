This episode is a dialogue between Brad and Irene a bout farming – growing food. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Brad: Is this your first visit to this area?

Irene: It is, and I’m surprised to see so many farm s. I thought farming was a dying industry.

Brad: Family farms and small-scale farming are disa ppearing, but agribusiness is alive and well, thanks to government subsidies.

Irene: Are they lucrative?

Brad: They can be, but the subsidies were originall y given to protect the livelihood of farmers.

Irene: And that’s not what’s happening?

Brad: Well, agribusiness has edged out small-scale farms because output is the name of the game. A lot of small-scale farmers have  thrown in the towel.

Irene: That’s a shame, but the subsidies are still used to protect domestic food production, right?

Brad: That may be, but we’re losing a way of life. I come from a long line of farmers.

Irene: And you’re not farming?

 Brad: Nope.

Irene: What do you do?

Brad: I work for the government agency that gives o ut subsidies to the very farms that put us out of business.

Irene: That’s quite a twist of fate.

Brad: You said it.

Our dialogue begins with Brad asking Irene, “Is this your first visit to this area?” Is this the first time you have been here? Irene says,  “It is, and I’m surprised to see so many farms. I thought farming was a dying indust ry.” A “farm” is a large area of land where food is grown and animals are also ke pt, animals that are used eventually for food.

Irene thought that “farming was a dying industry.” An “industry” (industry) is a business, or more properly a kind of business – a p art of the economy that includes similar kinds of businesses. So, we could have the “movie industry.” That would include all of the companies here in Los  Angeles and other places that make movies.

Irene thought that farming was “a dying industry.” “Dying” comes from the verb “to die.” “To die” means to stop living, to no long er be living. “Dying” implies that something is still alive, but it’s going to be dead  very soon. The idea here is that not that many people are going into farming and tha t the business of farming won’t be around for a long time, at least in the ar ea that Brad and Irene are talking about.

Brad says, however, “Family farms and small-scale f arming are disappearing, but agribusiness is alive and well, thanks to governmen t subsidies.” A “family farm” would be a farm owned by – that’s correct – a singl e family. Back in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, most farms were probably owned by individual families that grew food for themselves a nd, of course, to sell to other people.

However, during the 1970s and 80s, many of these fa mily farms disappeared – that is, they were no longer able to be profitable,  and so the families either sold

the farm to a large business or to someone who want ed to do something else with the land. “Agribusiness” (agribusiness) is for med from two different words, “agriculture” and “business.” “Agriculture” is anot her word to describe the growing of food. “Agribusiness” is a word we use to describ e large companies that own farms.

Brad says that “agribusiness is alive and well.” Th at expression “to be alive and well” is quite common in English. It means to be do ing very well, to have a lot of success. The agribusinesses are successful, accordi ng to Brad, “thanks to” – or because of –“government subsidies.” A “subsidy” (su bsidy) is when someone gives you money to do something. In the United Stat es, as in many countries, the government tries to protect farms and to protect the agricultural business by giving businesses and farmers money – money to grow  certain kinds of food.

Now, the economic reasoning for this activity is so mewhat questionable, according to some economists. Many economists say it doesn’t make sense for the government to pay people in farming when they d on’t pay people in other businesses in order to survive. Of course, there are arguments on the other side – that is, there are people who think it does do so me good.

Irene says, “Are they lucrative?” “They” here refer s to the businesses involved in agriculture. The word “lucrative” (lucrative) means  profitable. It means making a lot of money. If your business is lucrative, you are making a lot of money, you are getting rich. Brad says, “They can be,” meaning the se businesses can be lucrative, “but the subsidies were originally given  to protect the livelihood of farmers.”

Brad explains why the government started giving sub sidies to farmers many years ago. The reason, and the reason that many gov ernments give, for the subsidies is “to protect the livelihood of farmers. ” “Livelihood” (livelihood) refers to one’s job or career – how you make a living, how yo u make money. My livelihood is working for the Center for Educational Developme nt doing these podcasts. Other people’s livelihoods depend on different jobs  that they have.

The “livelihood of farmers,” then, refers to the ec onomic wellbeing of farmers, the jobs of farmers. When most farms were owned by fami lies, the government felt it was important to protect these families to make sur e that they didn’t, if you will, “go out of business.” Irene says, “And that’s not w hat’s happening?” She’s questioning Brad, asking him if that is not still the purpose of these government subsidies.

Brad says, “Well, agribusiness has edged out small- scale farms because output is the name of the game.” The phrasal verb “to edge  (edge) – out” means to do better than someone or something else so that you b ecome more powerful and the other person or thing becomes less powerful, le ss influential, less successful. Brad is saying that agribusiness “has edged out sma ll-scale” – small – “farms.” It has become more successful. Why? Brad explains that  “output is the name of the game.” “Output” is what you produce, what you make.

Agribusinesses are large companies that produce a l ot of food, and that makes them more successful. The phrase “the name of the g ame” means the most important thing in deciding how the way things are done. The name of the game in college is getting good grades and saying nice t hings to your professor, which gives you good grades. Well, that’s not exactly tru e. Just because you say something nice to your professor doesn’t mean he or  she will give you a good grade, but in my own experience, it doesn’t hurt – meaning it will never harm you.

The name of the game here in agribusiness is “outpu t” – is producing a lot of food. Brad says, “A lot of small-scale farmers have  thrown in the towel.” The expression “to throw in the towel” (towel) means to  give up, to stop trying, especially when something seems too difficult. Iren e responds, “That’s a shame.” The expression “that’s a shame” (shame) is used to express sadness about something that is happening, especially something that seems unfair, unjust.

Irene says “The subsidies are still used to protect  domestic food production, right?” “Domestic” (domestic) here means within the  country. The opposite of domestic would be “international.” This is another reason why governments give subsidies to farmers. It’s to protect the productio n of food within the country, so that in case there is a war or other problems, they  don’t have to rely on or depend on other countries in order to get their foo d. At least, that’s one of the official reasons given. I think it probably is more  political than that, but we won’t get into that here.

Brad says, “That may be,” meaning yes, it’s possibl e that these subsidies are used to protect domestic food production. “But,” he  says, “we’re losing a way of life.” A “way of life” is a way of living, the way things are done, the culture of that particular area. Brad says, “I come from a long lin e of farmers.” If you say “I come from a long line” of something, you mean that you h ave many family members involved in a particular business or industry or ar ea. There is also the implication here that this has been going on for many years, pe rhaps many generations.

For example, I come from a long line of plumbers – people who fix toilets and sinks. My grandfather was a plumber. My uncles were  plumbers. My father was

not a plumber – he was a teacher – but the McQuilla ns are known in the place where I grew up, St. Paul, Minnesota, as plumbers, and still today my cousins own McQuillan Brothers Plumbing. So, I come from a long line of plumbers. I can also say I come from a long line of teachers, becau se my father is a teacher, my sister and two of my brothers were teachers, I have  nieces who are teachers. But we’re talking not about me, but about Brad.

Brad is asked by Irene, “And you’re not farming?” B rad says, “Nope.” “Nope” is an informal way of saying no. Irene says, “What do you do?” Brad says, “I work for the government agency,” the part of the governm ent, “that gives out subsidies to the very farms that put us out of business.” Bra d says that he works for the government agency, the part of the government, that  actually gives the money, the subsidies, to these large agribusinesses. He us es the term “the very farms that put us out of business.”

The use of the word “very” here means these precise , or exact, things. It’s a word used to emphasize the next word, the following word . Usually this construction, this word, is used when you are pointing out someth ing that is ironic, something that seems contradictory. For example, you could say “The very parents who complain about the schools not doing their job are the ones that never help their children with their homework.” That’s not true, but  that would be an example of using this word “very” to specify a group who seems  to be acting in some contradictory manner.

Irene says, “That’s quite a twist of fate.” A “twis t (twist) of fate (fate)” is an unexpected change in events, especially one that is  ironic. So in this case, Brad used to work on a family farm, and now he works for  the government agency that gives money to the agribusinesses that in some ways  put the family farms out of business. So, it’s “ironic” (ironic). It’s the oppo site of what you would expect.

Brad ends the dialogue by saying, “You said it.” Th at expression “you said it” is often used when you want to agree with what the oth er person has said and emphasize how correct the other person is. I’d say we use this expression when the other person is saying something negative. For example, it’s really cold in here. You might say, “You said it.” It is cold in h ere. You are agreeing with the other person and emphasizing how correct you think the other person is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
