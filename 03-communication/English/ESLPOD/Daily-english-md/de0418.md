This episode is called “Getting Bad Service.”  It’s a dial ogue between two people talking about the bad customer service they received at a c offee house (or a coffee shop) that they went to.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Buck:  I’m never going to that coffee house again!

Star:  Why?  What happened?

Buck:  It’s the third time in a week that I’ve had lousy se rvice.  I don’t expect five- star treatment, but I do expect service industry employees to be at least civil.

Star:  What happened this time?

Buck:  I walked in and went up to the counter to place m y order.  The woman working there was talking to her friend, another custome r.  I stood there, clearly needing to be waited on and she couldn’t have cared l ess.

Star:  You mean she didn’t even acknowledge you?

Buck:  Are you kidding?  She didn’t stop talking for one second.  When she finally took a breath, I told her my order.  She gave me a dir ty look and finally turned around to get my coffee.  She practically threw it at me !

Star:  Well, maybe she was having a bad day.  At least you  got your coffee.

Buck:  I got a  cup of coffee, but not the kind I ordered.  When I r ealized it, I went back to the counter and she was still talking to her frien d.  I interrupted her and

 told her that I got the wrong order.  She had the ch utzpah to try to tell me that I had made a mistake in telling her my order.  Not only d id she not take responsibility for her mistake, she tried to tell me that  it was my fault!

Star:  That’s really infuriating.  What are you going to do?

Buck:  One good thing about her talking with her frien d for so long is that I got her name.  I’ll be calling the manager to complain.

Star:  Aren’t you overreacting?

Buck:  No, I’m not.  She’s lucky I didn’t pour the coffee over her head!

Our dialogue begins with Buck saying to his friend Star, “I’m never going to that coffee house again!” – that café where they serve coffee.   Star says, “Why? What happened?”  Buck says, “It’s the third time in a wee k that I’ve had lousy service.”  “Lousy” (lousy) means bad, not very good, poor quality.  So, “lousy service” is bad service.

He says, “I didn’t expect five-star treatment, but I do ex pect service industry employees to at least be civil.”  “Five-star treatment” w ould be very good customer service, service that makes you feel like an importa nt person.  So when you go to a restaurant and the waiter is nice to you and  gives you good service, helps you, that would be, possibly, five-star treatment.  “Service industry” refers to businesses who provide services to other companies or to other people. Hotels and restaurants are both part of the service indust ry.  So, Buck is saying here that he expects people (employees who work in the s ervice industries) to be at least civil or to at least be civil.  “Civil” means pol ite, formal, not necessarily friendly.  Someone can be polite to you but not be fri endly to you, that’s called being “civil.”  The word “civil” has several different me anings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Star says, “What happened this time?”  Buck says, “I walked i n and went up to the counter to place my order.”  A “counter” in a store or a business is usually a long, flat surface like a table, where the customer stand s on one side and the employee stands on the other side.  Often if you are go ing to buy something, you would go up to the counter (or the sales counter) and t he employee would take your money or your credit card.

 So, Buck goes up to the counter of this coffee shop and t he woman working there was talking to her friend, another customer.  He says, “I stood there, clearly needing to be waited on and she couldn’t have cared l ess.”  The expression “to be waited on” means that you are helped or served by an  employee; to have an employee ask, for example, what you want to buy or how t hey can help you. Buck says, “I stood there (meaning I stood waiting there) clearly needing to be waited on and she (the employee) couldn’t have cared less .”  The expression “I couldn’t have cared less” means to show that something is e xtremely unimportant (or not important) to you; something is le ss important than everything else.  For example: “I thought my professor wo uld be mad when I arrived at the classroom late, but he couldn’t have care d less,” meaning he didn’t care at all; it wasn’t important to him.  You will al so hear native speakers say, “I could have cared less,” but they mean “I couldn’t have care d less.”  There’s some confusion now and some people say, “I could have cared less,” but the original expression is “I couldn’t have cared less.”  That’ s what makes sense in this case.

Star says, “You mean she didn’t even acknowledge you?”  T o “acknowledge” someone means to recognize that someone is there, usuall y by looking into their eyes and saying “hello,” even if you don’t have time to s peak with them.  So the employee might look at you and nod her head and smile so that you know that she knows that you are waiting.  But apparently, this emp loyee didn’t even acknowledge Buck.  Buck says, “Are you kidding?  She didn’t st op talking (to her friend) for one second (she kept talking to her).  When she finally took a breath, I told her my order.”  To “take a breath” (breath) mean s to stop speaking for a short period of time so that you can breathe in.  I nee d to do this when I am recording the podcast; I need to stop sometimes and take a breath.  Here, it means a short amount of time.

So, when she stopped talking for short amount of time B uck told her his “order,” what he wanted to buy.  The employee gave him a dirty l ook.  A “dirty look” is when you change your face so that the other person knows yo u are not happy or you are angry.  If you walk into a library and you are t alking loudly or laughing, the people working there (the librarians) may give you a  dirty look.  I do this all the time when I’m in a restaurant and someone starts yel ling on their cell phone (their mobile phone) in the table next to me.  I tur n and I give them a dirty look, because, of course, it’s not polite to have your telephon e conversation in someone else’s ear.  You should step outside the restauran t and continue your phone call.  Well, that’s the way it should work, but t his is Los Angeles and it doesn’t work that way very often.

 Buck says that the employee gave him “a dirty look and fin ally turned around to get my coffee.  She practically threw it at me!”  “Practi cally,” here, means almost, virtually, nearly.  “Practically” can mean in a practical w ay, but here, when someone says “she practically kicked me,” or, “he practically ki lled me,” you mean they almost, nearly but not quite.  So, when the employee practically threw the coffee at Buck, she didn’t actually throw it but it w as something like that.

Star says, “Well, maybe she was having a bad day.  At least you got your coffee.” Buck says, “I got a  cup of coffee, but not the kind I ordered.  When I r ealized (this mistake), I went back to the counter and she was still tal king to her friend.  I interrupted her...” that is, I began speaking even tho ugh she was still speaking to someone else so that she would stop and listen to me.  “I  interrupted her and told her that I got the wrong order.  She had the chutzpah  to try to tell me that I had made a mistake in telling her my order.  “Chutzpah,” spe lled C-H-U-T-Z-P-A-H, is a Yiddish word meaning courage or confidence to do some thing that other people probably wouldn’t do, usually because they may be scared to do it. Another word we could use here is “nerve”: “She had the  nerve.”  Chutzpah can be a good thing; some people, in some circumstances, may make it a bad thing, doing that something that someone else doesn’t want or  would not do.  So, “She had the chutzpah to say that I made a mistake in telling  her my order.  Not only did she not take responsibility for her mistake, she tried  to tell me it was my fault!” To “take responsibility” for something means to agree th at something is your fault, to accept the consequences of your actions: “Yes, I m ade a mistake.”

Star says to Buck, “That’s really infuriating.”  Something  that is “infuriating” makes you very angry or mad.  Star says, “What are you goin g to do?”  Buck says, “One good thing about her talking with her friend  for so long is that I got her name,” meaning I remembered or I figured out – I wa s able to get this piece of information, namely her name.  Buck says, “I’ll be calling  the manager to complain.”  To say that you are unhappy about something  is to “complain.”

Star says, “Aren’t you overreacting?”  To “overreact” mean s to respond to something too strongly, to make something more importan t than it really is.  So, if your waiter forgets to bring French fries with your ha mburger, and you start yelling at the waiter and getting on your feet and p ounding your fist on the table, that would be “overreacting,” getting too emotional, too excited about something.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
