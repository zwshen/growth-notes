This episode is a dialogue between Liza and Sinobu abou t the topic of people dating other people not because they love them or are  romantically interested, but because they want to get their money.  No one woul d ever do that, of course! Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Liza:  Isn’t Jesse wonderful?  I’m so glad you got to meet  him last night.

Sinobu:  Uh, he’s a little young for you, don’t you th ink?  I know you’ve had boy toys in the past, but he takes the cake.

Liza:  He’s no boy toy!  It’s true that there’s a 30-year age difference, but who cares about age when you’re talking about love?

Sinobu:  Well, he’s certainly dressed for the part, with  all of that bling.  That watch must have set him back a couple of grand, at least.

Liza:  Oh, that was a little token of my affection for o ur one-month anniversary.  I just wanted him to know how much I cared about him.

Sinobu:  Well, he certainly knows now who holds the pur se strings, if he didn’t before.  I only hope he’s not preying on you.

Liza:  How can you say that?  I’ve never met anyone more ho nest or sincere.

 Sinobu:  He has you wrapped around his little finger,  that’s for sure.  I hope, for your sake, he’s not a gold digger, or that you see his tru e colors before you make it to the altar – again.

Liza:  Oh, I knew it was a mistake talking to you about J esse.  You’re such a cynic!

Sinobu:  And you’re a hopeless romantic!

Liza says to Sinobu, “Isn’t Jesse wonderful?”  Jesse is a man’ s name.  “I’m so glad you got to meet him last night.”  Sinobu says, “Uh , he’s a little young for you, don’t you think?  I know you’ve had boy toys in the past, bu the takes the cake.” Sinobu is saying that Liza’s new boyfriend is too young for  her.  He talks about boy toys.  A “boy toy” is a young, attractive man whom one m ay date for a short period of time.  If you are older – if you’re older woman, or if you’re much older than the man, you date this person, but you may not be very seriously interested in them for a relationship.

Sinobu says, “I know you’ve had boy toys in the past, but Je sse takes the cake.” The expression “to take the cake” means to be the biggest,  the best, even the worst, the most shocking, the most important, the most som ething in a series or a list of things.  Usually it’s something bad that the perso n has done, or you’re saying negative about this case – this circumstance.  In th is case, Sinobu is saying that Jesse takes the cake, meaning he’s the youngest or  the most obvious example of a boy toy, not someone that Liza should be d ating.

Liza says, “He’s no boy toy!” (he’s not a boy toy).  It’s true ,” she says, “that there’s a 30-year age difference, but who cares about a ge when you’re talking about love?”  An “age difference” is the difference be tween two people’s ages. My father married my mother, who was four years younger than he; the age difference was four years.  Sometimes the age difference  can be very large; if you’re the, I don’t know, prime minister of a country, yo u might be dating someone much, much younger than you – although some peop le probably wouldn’t like that!  Anyway, Liza says there’s a 30-year ag e difference, so Jesse is 30 years younger than she is.  Here in Hollywood, this is not uncommon, especially for the man to be older and the woman to be  younger, but this is the opposite case.

Sinobu says, “Well, he’s certainly dressed for the part, wi th all of that bling.”  “To dress for the part” means to wear clothes that are appr opriate for what you want

 to do.  Someone may say to you, when you’re starting a ne w job, “Be sure to dress the part,” or “dress for the part,” meaning wear the clothes that are appropriate for this office, for this job.  “Bling” (b ling) is an informal expression, fairly new in the last probably 10-15 years; it means expe nsive jewelry, things that you wear such as a watch, or a if you’re a woman, ea rrings, a necklace for either a man or a woman.  Often, these are expensive p ieces of jewelry, things with diamonds in them for example, that’s called “blin g.”  It’s a very informal term; it’s common among the younger generation, I would say.  But here, Sinobu is saying that this Jesse has a lot of bling.  “That watch,” h e says, “must have set him back a couple of grand, at least.”  Sinobu is refer ring to Jesse’s watch, saying that it must have set him back a lot of money.  “To set (someone) back” means to cost you a lot of money.  “I bought a new car a nd it set me back 15,000 dollars,” for example.  That means the car cost 15,000 dollars, that’s what I had to pay for it.

Sinobu says that that watch must have set him back a couple of grand.  “A grand” means, in the U.S., 1,000 dollars.  It’s an inf ormal word, just like “buck,” which is one dollar: “How much is that?”  “It’s ten bucks.”   “It’s a thousand bucks.” A thousand bucks could also be called simply “a grand.”  It  cost him a grand or two grand or three grand.  Notice that we don’t say “t hree grands” or “two grands.”  Even if it’s plural, it just remains “grand.”  In this case, he’s saying that the watch cost a couple of grand, meaning two or three thousand dollars.

Liza says, “Oh, that was a little token of my affection for our one-month anniversary.”  “A token of your affection” is a sign or a symbol that you love someone or that you care for someone; it’s a gift – somet hing that you give that person.  A man may give his wife a necklace as a token of his affection – affection or love.  And if he forgets to give a token of  his affection, for example on their wedding anniversary, well, he will probably be sle eping on the couch.  Not that I’ve ever done that, of course!

Sinobu is, of course, not too impressed – doesn’t really like Jesse, and Liza tries to defend him by saying, “Oh, that watch is something is something I gave him.” Sinobu then says, “Well, he certainly knows now who hold s the purse strings, if he didn’t before.”  “To hold the purse strings” mean s to be the person who decides how much money is spent.  A “purse” is a bag that h olds money. Nowadays, many women have purses; it’s not that common for a man.  But the strings of a purse are the pieces of material that tha t you would use, in an old purse, to make it tight.  You have to loosen the strings in order to open the little bag, which is the purse.  Nowadays, modern purses don’t h ave strings; they have zippers or buttons.  But the idea here is that the perso n that holds the purse strings is the person who decides how money is going to be spent.  In this case,

 Sinobu is saying that Jesse has control of the money; he hol ds the purse strings even though it’s not his money.

Sinobu says, “I hope he’s not preying on you.”  “To prey ( prey) on (someone)” means to try to control or hurt an animal or a person who is weaker than you are. There’s another word, “pray” (pray), that is related to saying something to God or to some divine being.  But here we’re not talking abou t religion, we’re talking about someone who’s trying to control or hurt another p erson.  Usually, that person is weaker than you are.

Liza is upset, she says, “How can you say that?  I’ve never met  anyone more honest or sincere.”  Sinobu says, “He has you wrapped aroun d his little finger, that’s for sure.”  The expression “to have (someone) wrap ped around your finger” or “wrapped around your little finger” means that tha t person controls you; that person is able to influence you, often because that person  is in love with you. Really, it’s because you are in love with them that they are able to control you. You may think they are in love with you, they may not be, but that person controls you because you love them.

So, Sinobu is saying that Jesse has Liza wrapped around his little finger.  He says, “I hope, for your sake, he’s not a gold digger, or that you see his true colors before you make it to the altar – again.”  Couple of different expressions there: first, “for your sake” means for your own benefit, to he lp you.  “I hope, for your sake,” meaning for your good, “that Jesse’s not a gold dig ger.”  “Gold,” here, just represents money.  “To dig for gold” means to try to fin d gold, for example, in the earth or in a rock in the mountains.  Here, however, a “gold digger” is a person who marries for money, someone who marries or dates some one so that they can get that person’s money because they are rich, or riche r than the person who is the gold digger.  It’s an insulting term; usually w e think of gold diggers being women marrying rich men, especially younger women marrying  older rich men. But here, the gold digger is a man.

Sinobu says he hopes that Liza will see Jesse’s true colors be fore she makes it to the altar.  “To se (someone’s) true colors” means to see how someone really is, to see the truth about someone.  The “altar” here refers to getting married.  In a church, in the front of the church there’s often an a ltar, especially in a Christian church.  The “altar” is where something is sacrificed, at least traditionally – in traditional religious ceremonies.  Here, however, it j ust refers to going to a church to get married, since, once again, traditionally most pe ople went to a church or a religious house of some sort to get married.  Obviously, L iza has been married before.

 Liza says, “Oh, I knew it was a mistake talking to you about  Jesse.  You’re such a cynic!”  A “cynic” (cynic) is a person who is very negative, who always thinks the worst about something or someone.  Sinobu responds by saying, “And you’re a hopeless romantic!”  A “hopeless romantic” is a person wh o wants to fall in love, who always believes the best about other people beca use they want to be loved by those people.  It’s also someone who may have bee n hurt many times in the past because they don’t consider the true colors of the person that they are falling in love with sometimes.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
