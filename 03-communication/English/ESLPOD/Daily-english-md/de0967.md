On this episode, we’re going to hear a dialogue bet ween Lois and Roger about being embarrassed. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lois: Please don’t embarrass me at the party tonigh t.

Roger: Me, embarrass you? I’d never do that.

Lois: You have, though, more than once.

Roger: Name one.

Lois: At the Johnsons’ party, you danced on the tab le while singing “I Am Woman”!

Roger: I was being the life of the party. Everybody  thought it was funny.

Lois: It was humiliating! Didn’t you notice more th an one person cringing and the awkward silence in the room when your song ended?

Roger: No, I didn’t, but I did notice Malik laughin g his head off and the Johnsons smiling.

Lois: That’s because Malik has your sense of humor and the Johnsons were humoring you. They were trying to put a good face o n your impromptu performance.

Roger: I’m not going to be a wallflower just becaus e you can’t take a joke. My exuberant personality is what gets us invited to so  many parties.

Lois: Yeah, right. Can I at least get you to promis e not to sing?

Roger: And disappoint my audience? Not a chance!

[end of dialogue] Lois begins by saying to Roger, “Please don’t embar rass me at the party tonight.” “To embarrass” (embarrass) someone means to make so meone feel uncomfortable, to make them feel, perhaps, self-con scious. Lois is asking Roger not to embarrass her at the party tonight. Roger sa ys, “Me, embarrass you? I’d never do that.” Notice Roger says “me” instead of “ I.” In informal English, in situations like this, we often use “me” instead of “I,” even though “I” is the grammatically correct form. Lois says, “You have, t hough, more than once,” meaning you have, in fact, embarrassed me more than  one time.

Roger says, “Name one,” meaning give me a specific example. Lois then gives him a specific example. She says, “At the Johnsons’  party, you danced on the table while singing ‘I Am Woman’!” The Johnsons are  probably friends of Roger and Lois. At the party that was held at the Johnson s’ house, Roger got up on top of a table and started dancing and singing the song  “I Am Woman.” “I Am Woman” is a song from the 1970s by, I believe, Hele n Reddy.

“I am woman, hear me roar, In number’s too big to ignore . . . Dah dah dah dah dah dah Dah dah dah dah dah daaaah dah”

I really don’t know this song since I am not a woma n.

Roger says, “I was being the life of the party.” Th at expression, “the life of the party,” means the person who is always very enterta ining, someone who is always making jokes, perhaps. Roger says, “Everybod y thought it was funny.” Lois disagrees. She says, “It was humiliating.” “Hu miliating” (humiliating) is something that is very embarrassing, extremely emba rrassing – something that makes you feel ashamed in front of other people, so mething that makes you feel really bad in front of other people. Lois thought t hat Roger’s singing was humiliating.

She says, “Didn’t you notice more than one person c ringing and the awkward silence in the room when your song ended?” “To crin ge” (cringe) means to have

a very negative feeling caused by being embarrassed  when someone does something unpleasant or difficult to watch. If your  friend is doing something very badly, like singing or dancing, you might cringe. Y ou might feel embarrassed for that person because they’re doing something that is  very embarrassing. Lois says there were people “cringing” at Roger’s perfor mance – his singing and dancing – and there was an “awkward silence in the room” when his song ended.

“Silence” is the absence of noise – when it is comp letely quiet. “Awkward” (awkward) is something that is uncomfortable, somet hing that people don’t like, often in a certain situation. An “awkward silence” would be when people don’t say anything when you would expect them to say somethin g. So, for example, if your friend sees you at a bar and you’re with your frien d’s girlfriend, he might come up to you and not say anything. There would be a very awkward silence. He might hit you, but the situation would certainly be consi dered awkward.

Roger says, “No, I didn’t,” meaning no, I didn’t no tice; I didn’t see people cringing or notice the awkward silence. “I did notice Malik laughing his head off and the Johnsons smiling.” “To laugh your head off” is to l augh very loudly for a long period of time because you think something is very,  very funny. Lois says, “That’s because Malik has your sense of humor and the Johns ons were humoring you.” The phrase “sense (sense) of humor (humor)” refers to the kinds of things that someone thinks are funny, the kinds of things that someone would laugh at. That’s your “sense of humor.”

Some people laugh at very obvious physical humor or  physical comedy – people falling, people falling down the stairs or falling over. Some people think that’s funny. That’s their “sense of humor.” Other people think other things are funny. Each of us has our own sense of humor, our own set of things that we find funny. Lois explains to Roger that Malik was laughing his head off because he has Roger’s sense of humor.

The Johnsons, however, were humoring Roger. “To hum or” someone, as a verb, means to do or say something to make the other pers on happy or to make sure the other person doesn’t get angry. Usually the ver b is used to indicate that the person is pretending, doesn’t really believe what t hey’re saying, or perhaps is not trying to cause any problems. So, they’re just agre eing with the other person. If someone is humoring you, they don’t really agree wi th you or they don’t really believe, perhaps, the things they are saying to you , but they don’t want you to get angry or upset. So, they say those things anyway.

Lois says, “They were trying to put a good face on your impromptu performance.” “To put a good face on” something means something s imilar to “to humor

someone.” It means to pretend to be happy or satisf ied with something, to try to be positive about something rather than negative. “ Impromptu” (impromptu) means without any planning. We might also use the w ord “spontaneous.” Something that is “impromptu” is something that you  do that you didn’t plan to do. You just decided to do it suddenly.

Roger says, “I am not going to be a wallflower just  because you can’t take a joke.” A “wallflower” (wallflower) is a person who is very shy, who doesn’t talk to other people, especially at a party or a large gath ering. “To take a joke” means to think something is funny, especially when people ar e laughing at you. If someone says you “can’t take a joke,” he means that you don ’t think things are funny that everyone else thinks are funny.

Roger says, “My exuberant personality is what gets us invited to so many parties.” “Exuberant” (exuberant) means with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement. Roger is saying that it is because he is so excitin g and interesting that he and Lois get invited to so many parties. Lois doesn’t b elieve this at all. She says, “Yeah, right.” Notice that even though it sounds as  if she were agreeing with Roger, in fact she is disagreeing with Roger. We kn ow that by the way that she says this expression: “Yeah, right.”

Lois says, “Can I at least get you to promise not t o sing?” Roger replies, “And disappoint my audience? Not a chance.” “To disappoi nt” someone is to make someone feel sad by not meeting their expectations – by doing something less than what people thought you would do. Roger says h is “audience” – that is, the people who will watch him sing and dance – would be  disappointed if he didn’t do his thing. That’s why he ends the dialogue by sayin g, “Not a chance,” meaning no way; there is no possibility of that happening –  in this case, of Roger not singing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
