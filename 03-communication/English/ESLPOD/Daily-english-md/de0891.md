[start of dialog]

Leo:  Here’s the mail.

Denise:  Did I get anything?

Leo:  No, sorry.  Are you expecting something?

Denise:  Yeah, I’m waiting for a decision letter ab out my application to the McQ program.  I should hear any day now.

Leo:  Have you thought about calling and checking o n the status?

Denise:  I called last week and my application was still under review. I was told that a decision was still pending.

Leo:  I’m sure it was just awaiting approval.  Ther e is no chance it’ll be rejected. You’re an ideal candidate and you’re sure to get go od news in a day or two.

Denise:  I hope you’re right.  In the meantime, I’m  on pins and needles.  Every time the mail carrier walks by, my heart skips a be at.

Leo:  I know this is important to you, but you’ve g ot to keep it in perspective.  It’s not a life-or-death situation.

Denise:  I am keeping it in perspective.  If I don’ t get into this program, it’s only the end of my career, my dream, and my future – tha t’s all!

Leo says to Denise, “Here's the mail.” Here are the  letters and packages we received from the post office. Denise says, “Did I get anything?” Did anything arrive or come for me? Leo says “No, sorry. Are you  expecting something?” Are you waiting for something? Denise says, “Yeah,” mea ning yes. “I'm waiting for a decision letter about my application to the McQ pro gram.” A “decision letter” would be a letter saying whether you were accepted into the program or not. It might be a letter saying whether you were accepted into a university or a college as a student or not. A “decision letter” could be a bout applying for a job and telling you whether you got the job or not. This is  a case where Denise is applying for some program. We’re not exactly sure w hat the program is – McQ program. So, it’s probably a good program with that  kind of name. Denise says she's waiting for a decision letter about her appli cation. “Application” is when you submit or you send in certain documents, certain pi eces of paper that have information about you and why you want to, in this case, be part of this program.

Denise says, “I should hear any day now.” “To hear”  (hear) in this case, means to receive a response, to receive an answer. We might also say “to hear back.” “Have you heard back from your sister?” You might s ay, “No, I wrote her a letter last week,” or “I sent her an e-mail,” more likely.  “But she hasn't responded to me. I haven’t heard back.” Denise says, “I should h ear,” meaning I should get a decision any day now. “Any day now” means very soon , in the very near future. We’re not sure exactly when, but it will be in a ve ry brief amount of time – “any day now.” Leo says, “Have you thought about calling  and checking on the status?” “To check on something” means to investiga te it, to make sure it's okay. “Status” (status) refers to the condition of someth ing, the situation that something is in. So, to call and check on the status would be  to call the organization and ask about your application. Were you accepted? Were you  rejected? – and so forth.

Denise in fact did call. She said, “I called last w eek and my application was still under review.” “To be under review” means it's bein g considered. They’re thinking about it. They’re looking at it carefully.  It's under review. “Under review” is normally used for some sort of official process,  some sort of official consideration by a(n) organization, or by someone i mportant. Denise was told that a decision – a decision about whether she will  be accepted into the program or not – was still “pending.” Something that is “pe nding” (pending) is something you haven't decided yet. You're waiting for a final  answer. It's still pending. You don't know if it's yes or no. Leo says, “I'm sure it was just awaiting approval.”

“Approval” is when you say “yes” to something. “Awa iting” means that it is waiting for. In this case, “awaiting approval” means that it's going to be approved. Really, they've already decided that. They just haven't gon e through the formal process of approving it. That's the implication that Leo is  trying to give here. Leo says, “There is no chance” – it is not even possible – “i t will be rejected” – it will be denied. They will say “no.” Leo is saying, “That’s not even possible.” “You're the ideal candidate and you're sure to get good news in  a day or two.” “Ideal” (ideal) in this case means perfect, the best. “Candidate” r efers to someone who is trying to get into a program or get into a job. You could have a “job candidate.” You could have a “program candidate” – someone trying t o get into a program. You can also have a candidate for public office. We hav e presidential candidates every four years here in the United States – two me n or two women, or a man and a woman. It's always been two men up to this po int, who want to be president. They are candidates for the presidency. They are candidates for that political office.

Denise is not a political candidate. She's a candid ate for this program. She's trying to get into the program. Leo says she's an i deal candidate and she is sure to get good news soon. “Sure to” means it will happ en. It will definitely happen. There's no doubt about it. Denise says, “I hope you 're right” – I hope you are correct. “In the meantime,” or until I find out, “I 'm on pins and needles.” The expression “to be on pins (pins) and needles (needl es) means to be very nervous, to be worried about something. “I'm on pin s and needles waiting to see whether my girlfriend will say ‘yes’ – “yes,” of co urse, to marrying me. That’s just an example. I'm already married. So, I don't have a  girlfriend but before I was married, I had a girlfriend and I asked her to marr y me, not just marry but marry me, and after I asked her, I was waiting for her an swer. I was on pins and needles. She said “yes,” of course. That's why she' s my wife.

Anyway, back to our story. Denise says that she's o n pins and needles waiting for a decision about whether she will be accepted i nto the McQ program. She says, “Every time the mail carrier walks by, my hea rt skips a beat.” A “mail carrier” is the person who brings the letters to yo ur house or to your office every day. We used to call them “mailmen” because they we re all men, but now there are women who also carry mail and some people didn' t like the term “mailmen,” so they changed it to “mail carrier.” A “carrier” i s anyone who carries something, who brings something from one place to another. Den ise says that when the mail carrier walks by, when he or she comes to her house , her heart skips a beat. To say that your heart “skips a beat” means that you a re very excited. You are waiting for something to happen. That's the express ion – “my heart skips a beat.” I'm very excited. I can't wait. I'm almost, almost sick with anticipation. Leo says, “I know this is important to you,” but you've got to k eep it in perspective. “To keep

something in perspective” means to be realistic, to  be calm, to be rational, not to get too excited about it.

Leo says, “It's not a life-or-death situation.” A “ life-or-death situation” would be a situation where you are either going to live or die , where you could die if something goes wrong. Leo is saying here that getti ng into this program is not a life or death situation. You won't die if you don't  get into it. Denise says, “I am keeping it in perspective. If I don't get into this  program, it's only the end of my career, my dream, and my future. That's all.” Denis e is making a joke here. She’s saying, “Oh, yes. I'm not getting too excited but,”  she says, “if I don't get into this program, it will be the end of my career,” the end of my work life. It will be the end of my dream and it will be the end of my future. So , of course, she really has not kept it in perspective. She thinks it is a life-or- death situation, a very serious situation if she doesn't get into the McQ program. Well Denise, I wish you luck. Not everyone can get into the McQ program.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.

Leo:  Here’s the mail.

Denise:  Did I get anything?
