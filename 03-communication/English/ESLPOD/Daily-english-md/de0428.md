This episode is called “Getting a Dream Job” – getting a  great job.  It’s a dialogue between Tandia and Hank who are looking for a good jo b, and while talking about it use a lot of vocabulary we would use to describe  someone’s job.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Tandia:  Do you want these want ads after I’m finished  with them? 

Hank:  No, I’m not going to find my dream job in the classifieds.  I’m going to have to get more creative with my job search.   

Tandia:  What are you looking for? 

Hank:  I want a job that’s rewarding and fast-paced, an d with good growth potential, but all I see are dead-end jobs. 

Tandia:  I know what you mean.  I’m looking for somethi ng that’s challenging, but also with flexible work hours.  All of my friends have gr eat jobs.  Why can’t I land one of them? 

Hank:  Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, we need a better game plan.   

Tandia:  What do you have in mind? 

Hank:  I’m not sure, but we need to get noticed.   

 Tandia:  Why don’t you take out a billboard?  That sho uld get you noticed. 

Hank:  Hey, that’s really thinking out of the box. 

Tandia:  I was joking! 

Hank:  I’m not.  That’s an inspired idea.  Now what sh ould we put on the billboard? 

Tandia:  You’re crazy!

Tandia starts by asking Hank “Do you want these want ads af ter I’m finished with them?”  The “want ads” are advertisements, announcements by a company that is looking for a new employee.  These usually appear in t he newspapers: the want ads.  Hank says, “No, I’m not going to find my dream  job in the classifieds.” A “dream job” would be a perfect job, an ideal job, a great job.  The “classifieds” refers to a section of the newspaper where there are ver y many small advertisements, usually without any pictures or colors, usual ly at the back of the newspaper.  It’s a place where if you are going buy somet hing or sell your car, you can put a little advertisement – a little announceme nt.  This is where the want ads are found, in the classifieds, or the classified section of the newspaper. 

Hank says, “I’m going to have to get more creative with my job search.”  A “job search” is the process of looking for a new job.  Going th rough and looking at want ads, applying for the job, interviewing for the j ob; all of these are part of the job search. 

Tandia says, “What are you looking for?”  Hank replies, “ I want a job that’s rewarding and fast-paced.”  Something that is “reward ing” gives you a lot of pleasure, makes you feel happy or pleased.  “Fast-paced” m eans rapid, quick, very fast.  People who live in New York City have very fast- paced lives. Everyone walks quickly, moves quickly, talks quickly, eats quickly – you get the idea, very fast-paced.  Hank says he wants a job that’s rewa rding and fast- paced, and with good growth potential.  “Growth pote ntial” means opportunities to move into a better, more interesting job.  “I’m lo oking for growth potential” – I’m looking for something that I can start at one job but then get a better job, usually in the same company.  Hank says that all he sees in the wa nt ads are dead-end jobs.  “Dead-end” means without any opportunities for g rowth potential, without any opportunities to move into a more interesting, high er paying job.  If someone  

 says, “I have a dead-end job,” they mean they can’t go a ny higher in the company and it’s not a very good job, usually. 

Tandia says, “I know what you mean (I understand what yo u are saying).  I’m looking for something that’s challenging.”  Something is “challenging” if it is difficult but it’s interesting and enjoyable.  Tandia a lso wants a job with flexible work hours.  “Flexible” means that you can change them easi ly.  Flexible work hours would be being able to work a different schedule depending on your preferences, depending on what else you had to do that day.  The schedule, that is, can change; that would be a flexible work schedule, o r flexible work hours. 

Tandia says, “All of my friends have great jobs.  Why can’t  I land one of them?” To “land” something means to get something: to get a job, to get a certain project, to make a certain deal or agreement.  If you a re a salesperson, you might say “I landed a big contract today” – this compa ny is going to buy a lot from us, I got it.  “Land” has several different meanings in English, however; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explan ations. 

Hank says, “Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, we need a better game plan.” To “feel sorry for yourself” means to feel unhappy and sa d about the situation you are in; we might say “to pity yourself.”  You don’t w ant to feel sorry for yourself, spend all day saying “Oh, my poor life!”  Instea d, you want to get a better game plan.  A “game plan” is a strategy, a pla n for doing something. 

Tandia says, “What do you have in mind?” – what is your i dea?  Hank says, “I’m not sure, but we need to get noticed.”  “To get notice d” means to get other people’s attention, to become well known to other peop le.  This actually has a couple of different meanings in English, “to get notice d,” you can, of course, find those additional explanations in the Learning Guide fo r this episode. 

Tandia says, “Why don’t you take out a billboard?  That should get you noticed.” A “billboard” is a very large sign that you usually see on  the side of a road that has some advertising on it.  We have billboards here in L os Angeles on almost every street – advertisements, big signs.  Sunset Boulevard, which is a famous street here in Los Angeles, is known for its big billboa rds advertising movies and musicians and so forth.   

Tandia is joking; she doesn’t really think they should buy, or take out, a billboard and put an advertisement on it.  Hank says, however, “Hey,  that’s really thinking out of the box.”  Hank thinks that Tandia is being seriou s.  “To think out of the box” or “to think outside of the box” means to think crea tively, to think of new,  

 interesting, perhaps unusual ideas.  Tandia says, “I was j oking!” – I wasn’t serious.  Hank says, “I’m not (I’m not joking).  That’s an  inspired idea.”  An “inspired idea” is one that is exciting and interesting, one that has very good qualities.  Finally, Hank says, “Now what should we put o n the billboard?”  And Tandia says, “You’re crazy!”  She doesn’t think this is a ser ious idea at all. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Tandia:  Do you want these want ads after I’m finished  with them? 

Hank:  No, I’m not going to find my dream job in the classifieds.  I’m going to have to get more creative with my job search.   

Tandia:  What are you looking for? 

Hank:  I want a job that’s rewarding and fast-paced, an d with good growth potential, but all I see are dead-end jobs. 

Tandia:  I know what you mean.  I’m looking for somethi ng that’s challenging, but also with flexible work hours.  All of my friends have gr eat jobs.  Why can’t I land one of them?
