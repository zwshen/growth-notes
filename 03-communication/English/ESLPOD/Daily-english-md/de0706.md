This episode is called “Feeling Ill (or sick) from Food While Traveling.”  Sounds like fun!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Rumi:  I’m as sick as a dog!

Hugo:  It serves you right.  I warned you not to ea t food sold by food vendors on the street.  Cleanliness is not a priority at some of those food stands.

Rumi:  I’m not one to turn up my nose up at street food.  On the street is where you’ll find the most authentic food, the food the l ocals eat.  And plus, I have a stomach of steel.

Hugo:  You had a stomach of steel, and there’s no w ay to guard against undercooked or contaminated food.

Rumi:  Okay, you’re right.

Hugo:  It’ll probably take days for whatever it is that’s making you sick to work itself out of your system.  Some vacation!

Rumi:  Just be grateful you’re not puking your guts  out like I am.

Hugo:  Believe me, I’m thanking my lucky stars.

[end of dialogue]

Rumi begins our dialogue by saying, “I’m as sick as  a dog!”  This is an old expression that means to be very sick, to be very i ll: “I’m sick as a dog.”  Hugo

says, “It serves you right.”  The expression or phr ase “it serves you right” means that you deserve the negative consequences that you  are suffering now; you did something wrong, and now you are paying the price.  “It serves you right” implies that you did something wrong, and because you did s omething wrong now you are suffering.  Hugo says, “I warned you’” – meanin g I told you something bad would happen – “I warned you not to eat food sold b y food vendors on the street.”  A “vendor” (vendor) is anyone who sells s omething, but we usually use the term in talking about people selling things fro m small carts or just from their own pockets on the street; that’s one association of the word.  A “food vendor” would be a person who’s selling food on the street,  often from a truck or some small vehicle.  Hugo says, “Cleanliness is not a pr iority at some of those food stands.”  “Cleanliness” means very clean.  He’s say ing that some of the food vendors on the street aren’t very clean, and this i s why Rumi is sick.  He says it’s not a “priority,” meaning it’s not important to the m.

He calls the food vendors “food stands.”  The “stan d” is actually the physical place where the person is selling the food.  A “foo d stand” is small, a place where you have the person keeping the food or perhaps coo king the food, and then selling it to you.  This happens in many cities, no t in Los Angeles very much.  But I know if you go, for example, to New York City the re will be – or used to be, the last time I was there – people selling hot dogs on the streets for example.  And many cities have this custom of selling food on the  streets.  Los Angeles has food trucks that go around and sell different kinds  of food.  Of course, Los Angeles is very much a car culture; that is, everyo ne has a car, and you can’t travel very easily without one.  So logically, the food vendors have trucks rather than just stands on the street.

Rumi says, “I’m not one to turn up my nose up at st reet food.”  The expression “to not turn your nose up at (something)” is a comp licated way of saying that you don’t think that you are too good for something; yo u don’t think that you are better than someone or something.  If you just say,  “I’m a person who turns his nose up at taking the bus,” for example in Los Ange les, that means that you think you’re too good to do that, you are better than oth er people; you are superior, we would say.  Rumi says she’s not someone who turns h er nose up at street food. “On the street is where you’ll find the most authen tic food,” she says, “the food that locals eat.”  “Locals” means people who live i n the area where you are visiting, not tourists; the opposite of a tourist w ould be a local.  In Los Angeles, I’m a local.  If you live in Tokyo, you are a local  in Tokyo.  Rumi says the street is where you find the most authentic food.  “Authentic ” means real, true, something that actually exists.  In this case, really the bes t food, the food that is most like what people in that area or city eat.  “And plus,” Rumi says, “I have a stomach of

steel.”  “To have a stomach of steel,” or simply a “steel stomach,” means that you can eat almost anything and not get sick.

Hugo says, “You had a stomach of steel.”  He’s usin g the verb in the past tense, saying well, maybe you used to in the past but not anymore.  He says, “there’s no way to guard against undercooked or contaminated  food.”  “To guard against (something)” means to protect yourself from somethi ng, to do something to prevent something bad from happening to you.  The b est way to guard yourself against getting sick is to always wash your hands b efore you eat.  That’s just an example; that’s not always true of course, but it’s  a good idea I think.  Hugo says, “there’s no way to guard against undercooked food.”   “Undercooked” food is not cooked enough; it’s food that needs to be cooked mo re.  If it’s not cooked properly, some of the food could be “raw,” meaning uncooked, and some food is dangerous when it is uncooked.  Pork, for example, the meat of a pig, is often unsafe when undercooked.  “Contaminated” food is fo od that has something in it that is not food or that is dangerous.  So for exam ple, if we say the water is “contaminated,” we mean that there is something in the water that should not be there and that will make you sick if you drink it.

Rumi says, “Okay, you’re right,” meaning you are co rrect.  Hugo says, “It’ll probably take days for whatever that is making you sick to work itself out of your system.”  That’s a kind of complicated sentence.  H ugo says it will take days – many days – for this thing that is making you sick,  it’s going to take some time for that to work itself out of your system.  “To work itself out of your system” means for your body to be no longer affected by it.  Real ly, it’s another way of saying it will take a while for you to get better.  Sometimes , sickness caused by a virus or by bacterial infection takes a while to work itself  out of your system, so that you are no longer affected by it.  Hugo says, “Some vac ation!”  Now, “some” is a common word in English, with many meanings, some of  which you can find in our Learning Guide.  Here, however, when used in an exp ression like this, it’s used to mean “not,” or “this is not,” or something that would be negative.  For example, you are going to take a walk in the park, and sudde nly it starts to rain; you might say, “Oh!  Some walk!” meaning this is not a good w alk.  You’re saying that whatever follows the word “some” is bad or is not a s good as you wanted it to be; it’s showing your disappointment.  “Some wedding!  The bride never showed up.” The “bride” is the woman who’s getting married.  “S ome wedding!” meaning, boy, that was a terrible wedding.  In fact, it wasn’t ev en a wedding at all, because the bride did not go – which is always a problem if you ’re getting married!  Some advice from me, who is married, always make sure th at the other person is also there to get married with you, because if they’re n ot, well, you’re going to have some problems!

Rumi says, “Just be grateful you’re not puking your  guts out like I am.”  “Just be grateful” means you should be thankful; you should think yourself fortunate that you are not “puking your guts out.”  This is a rath er ugly phrase; “to puke” (puke) means to vomit, to throw up, when the food that was  in your stomach suddenly goes out your mouth the wrong way.  Your “guts” are  a general way of referring to your stomach or the lower part of your abdomen.  The expression means to be sick a lot, to be vomiting a lot.

Hugo says, “Believe me, I’m thanking my lucky stars .”  This is an old expression; “to thank your lucky stars” means to be very gratef ul for something, to be very appreciative, to be in this case happy that somethi ng bad did not happen to you. Remember that song, I think it was from the 70s?  “ And I thank my lucky stars that you are who you are and not just another…(some thing something) come to break my heart” – something like that.  Remember th at?  No?

Okay, now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time a t a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Rumi:  I’m as sick as a dog!

Hugo:  It serves you right.  I warned you not to ea t food sold by food vendors on the street.  Cleanliness is not a priority at some of those food stands.

Hugo:  You had a stomach of steel, and there’s no w ay to guard against undercooked or contaminated food.

Rumi:  Okay, you’re right.

Hugo:  It’ll probably take days for whatever it is that’s making you sick to work itself out of your system.  Some vacation!

Rumi:  Just be grateful you’re not puking your guts  out like I am.

Hugo:  Believe me, I’m thanking my lucky stars.

[end of dialogue]

We thank our lucky stars that we have the wonderful  Dr. Lucy Tse to write our scripts.  By the way, the song that I was thinking of, that’s James Taylor, “Your Smiling Face,” 1977.  I know, you probably didn’t c are!

From Los Angeles, California, we do care, and I tha nk you for listening.  I know it’s been a weird episode, but I’m hoping that you’ ll come back and listen to us again soon here on ESL Podcast.
