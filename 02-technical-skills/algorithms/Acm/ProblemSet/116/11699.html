<h2>Problem A: Rooks</h2>

<img src="p11699.png" align=right>

You have unexpectedly become the owner of a large chessboard,
having fifteen squares to each side. Because you do not know
how to play chess on such a large board, you find an
alternative way to make use of it.
<p>
In chess, a rook attacks all squares that are
in the same row or column of the chessboard as it is.
For the purposes of this problem, we define a rook as also
attacking the square on which it is already standing.
<p>
Given a set of chessboard squares, how many rooks are needed to attack
all of them?
<p>

<h3>Input Specification</h3>
Input consists of a number of test cases.
Each test case consists of fifteen lines each containing fifteen characters
depicting the chess board.
Each character is either a period (<tt>.</tt>) or a hash (<tt>#</tt>).
Every chessboard square depicted by a hash must be attacked by
a rook. After all the test cases, one more line of input appears.
This line contains the word <tt>END</tt>.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
...............
...............
...............
...............
...............
...............
...............
.......#.......
...............
...............
...............
...............
...............
...............
...............
END
</pre>

<h3>Output Specification</h3>
Output consists of exactly one line for each test case. The line contains
a single integer, the minimum number of rooks that must be placed
on the chess board so that every square marked with a hash is attacked.
