This episode is called “Planning for Retirement.”  It’s a dialogue between Paulina and Carlos, and it uses some vocabulary that is common in t he United States when talking about paying for your retirement years.  Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paulina:  Did you get your social security statement?  I ju st got mine in the mail. If I keep working at this rate for the next 20 years, bet ween Social Security and my savings, I should be sitting pretty for retirement.

Carlos:  Yeah, I should be okay when I retire, too.  I’ ve been contributing to a 401(k) through my work for years, and my company gives a mat ching contribution.

Paulina:  Really?  I never bothered with a 401(k).

Carlos:  A 401(k) really adds up over time.  I also have a n IRA, which is tax- deferred, and I have my money in a portfolio that is sp lit between stocks and bonds.  All of these investments are for the long haul, of course.  How about you?  What’s your retirement plan?

Paulina:  I have money stashed away in a nice little nest  egg.

Carlos:  Where do you have your money invested?

Paulina:  It’s safe and sound, don’t you worry.

Carlos:  [Laughs] You make it sound like you have it stashe d under your mattress.

 Paulina:  A mattress is a very safe place for your money!

Our dialogue begins with Paulina asking Carlos, “Did you  get your Social Security statement?”  “Social Security” is a U.S. governme nt program that allows you to get money after you stop working, when you retire .  You pay taxes every year when you work, and those taxes are given back to you w hen you stop working.  A Social Security statement is a piece of paper  the government sends you every year that tells you how much money you have spent, or rather, how much money you have paid the government – the government is the one that spends the money!  Paulina says, “I just got (or received) mine in the mail.  If I keep working at this rate for the next 20 years, between  Social Security and my savings, I should be sitting pretty for retirement.”  Pau lina says, “If I keep working at this rate (“at this rate” means at this pace, working the same number of hours each week) for the next 20 years.”  She says, “between Socia l Security and my savings.”  The word “between” normally means in the midd le of two things, but here the use is a little bit different.  It means toge ther, combined, both.  So she’s saying if I take both my Social Security money and my savings (the money that she put in a bank and saved) she should be sitting pretty f or retirement.  To be “sitting pretty” means to be in a good situation, a goo d position.  You don’t have any problems or worries, especially financially.  “Retirem ent” is the period of time after you stop working.  In the United States, it’s usual ly at age 62 or 65.

Carlos says, “Yeah (yes), I should be okay when I retire, t oo.  I’ve been contributing (I’ve been putting money in) to a 401(k).”   A “401(k)” is a special type of U.S. retirement account that the employer (the pers on who you work for, or the company you work for) gives money to the workers for their r etirement.  The workers also give money, or put money into the 401(k).  I n some companies, the worker is the only one that puts money into the 401(k), but in some companies – in most companies both the company and the employee (the person working at the company) “contribute,” or put money into this account,  and you invest that money.  You put it in stocks or other financial “instrumen ts,” as they’re called – other financial investments, and you hope you will have m ore money when you retire.  401(k)s are usually accounts that you don’t have to pay taxes on when you put the money in.  You have to pay taxes, typically, whe n you take the money out when you retire.

So, Carlos has a 401(k); he says, “my company gives me a match ing contribution.”  A “matching contribution” is what the co mpany gives or puts into your retirement account.  “Matching” means usually they put  in the same amount as you do.  “Contribution” just means what you give to som eone or something.

 Paulina says, “Really?  I never bothered with a 401(k).”   “I never bothered” means I have never done that, it seemed like too much tr ouble so I never did it.

Carlos says, “A 401(k) really adds up over time.”  To “add up,” here, means to accumulate, to get more and more, to total.  “Add up”  has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanation.  Here, it’s a two-word phrasal verb meanin g to accumulate, to grow. Carlos says, “I also have an IRA.”  “IRA” stands for (or m eans) individual retirement account.  This is another special account – ret irement account that you can have in the United States.  It is also one that you don’t have to pay taxes on when you put the money into your IRA account.  Carl os says that his IRA is tax-deferred.  To “defer” means to do something later , at a later time.  So, “tax- deferred” means you don’t pay taxes now, but you’ll pay i t later.  You’ll pay the government taxes on the money when you take the money o ut after you retire.

Carlos says that he has his money in a portfolio that is spl it between stocks and bonds.  A “portfolio” is a word that describes all of you r investments, especially stocks and bonds.  “Stocks” are partial ownership that you ha ve in a company. They are sold in something called “shares.”  You buy share s in a company, that means you’re buying a certain small percentage of the comp any.  You own part of the company when you buy stock.  A “bond” (bond) is an a greement where the company or a government borrows money from you and agree s to pay you back with interest at a future date.  “Bond” has a couple o f different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide, again, for some additional explanations.

Carlos says that his portfolio is split between stocks and bo nds.  “Split,” here, just means divided, when you have more than one part of som ething.  Carlos says that all of these investments are for the long haul, of  course.  The “long haul” (haul) means for the long-term, over the long period of time, not immediately.  If someone says, “We’re here for the long haul,” they mean  we are here for a long time, we’re not going to worry about what happens in the next year or two years; we are worried about or we are concerned about only w hat happens after many years.  Another word for “long haul” is “long run.”  The economist John Maynard Keynes once said, “In the long run, we’re all dead,” me aning if you worry too much about only what happens after many years, you may not be alive!

Carlos says that he has his investments, and they are for the  long haul.  Then he asks Paulina, “How about you?  What’s your retirement pl an?”  Paulina says, “I have my money stashed away in a nice little nest egg.”  T o “stash (stash) away” something means to hide something, to put it in a secre t place.  A “nest egg” is

 money that you are going to use, in this case, for reti rement.  Money that you save for your retirement when you stop working, that’s call ed a “nest (nest) egg.” Carlos says, “Where do you have your money invested?”  Where  did you put your money – stocks, bonds, etc.?  Paulina says, “It’s safe an d sound, don’t you worry.”  The expression “to be safe and sound” means to b e secure, without any danger, without any worry.  Whenever there’s a big fir e here in Los Angeles, or an earthquake, some members of my family – the ones who st ill love me! – will call me and ask if I am okay, and I will tell them I am “safe and sound,” I am fine.

Carlos laughs at Paulina and says, “You make it sound like  (you are giving me the impression that) you have your money stashed under your mattress.”  Your “mattress” is what you sleep on – what most of us sleep on at night.  Paulina says, “A mattress is a very safe place for your money!” suggestin g that she doesn’t have her money invested anywhere or in a bank, but  she has it in her house underneath her mattress.  Putting some money under neath (or below) your mattress is a traditional way of saving your money – of  keeping your money. But, of course, it’s not a very good investment, althoug h nowadays, perhaps, it is the safest one!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Paulina:  Did you get your Social Security statement?  I just got mine in the mail. If I keep working at this rate for the next 20 years, bet ween Social Security and my savings, I should be sitting pretty for retirement.

Carlos:  Yeah, I should be okay when I retire, too.  I’ ve been contributing to a 401(k) through my work for years, and my company gives a mat ching contribution.

Paulina:  Really?  I never bothered with a 401(k).

Carlos:  A 401(k) really adds up over time.  I also have a n IRA, which is tax- deferred, and I have my money in a portfolio that is sp lit between stocks and bonds.  All of these investments are for the long haul, of course.  How about you?  What’s your retirement plan?

Paulina:  I have money stashed away in a nice little nest  egg.

Carlos:  Where do you have your money invested?

 Paulina:  It’s safe and sound, don’t you worry.

Carlos:  [Laughs] You make it sound like you have it stashe d under your mattress.

Paulina:  A mattress is a very safe place for your money!
