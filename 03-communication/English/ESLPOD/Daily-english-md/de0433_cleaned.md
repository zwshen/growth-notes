This episode is called “Describing People’s Voices.”  It’s a dialogue between Adriana and Ralph talking about the qualities of peop le’s voices, common adjectives we use to describe different voices.  Let’s get st arted. 

[start of dialogue] 

Adriana:  Shhh, I’m trying to listen to the radio. 

Ralph:  How can you listen to that radio station?  All of their deejays have such funny voices. 

Adriana:  That’s precisely why I like it.  Take this guy, K evin.  He has a deep, husky voice that I find really sexy. 

Ralph:  This guy?  His voice is so monotone that it lulls me to sleep every time I hear it. 

Adriana:  Well, if you don’t like his voice, how about h is sidekick, Lisa May?  Her voice is music to my ears. 

Ralph:  She has a nice lilt in her voice, but it’s so hig h-pitched and squeaky.  It can really be grating to listen to her for more than a  few minutes.   

Adriana:  Okay, if you don’t like their voices, what kind o f voices do you like? 

Ralph:  I like a gravelly voice, speaking softly and saying...  

 Adriana:  I’m not talking about your fantasies.  I don ’t want to know anything about those!

Adriana begins the dialogue by saying to Ralph, “Shhh .”  The expression “shhh,” or the sound “shhh,” is what we use to get someone to be  quiet.  Technically, when you do that is called “shushing” someone.  Well, Ad riana shushes Ralph; Ralph said, “How can you listen to that radio station?   All of their deejays have such funny (or unusual) voices.”  Sometimes the word “funny ” means unusual, strange, not comic.  A “deejay” (deejay), sometimes abbre viated with the letters “D” and “J” because it actually comes from the abbreviation  for disk jockey.  A “disk jockey” or “deejay” is a person who plays music and, usua lly, is on the radio.  They play music; they talk about the songs – the pe rson that you hear on the radio, at least the music radio. 

Adriana says, “That’s precisely why I like it.”  She likes th e deejays because they have these interesting or unusual voices.  She says, “Take th is guy, Kevin.”  The verb here, to “take” something or someone, means to use someone as an example; it’s another way of saying for example.  You mi ght say, “I like traveling in the western part of the United States, where there  are beautiful parks.  Take California, we have some beautiful parks here in Califo rnia.”  I could also say “For example, California, we have some beautiful parks here in California.” 

Well, Adriana says, “Take this guy, Kevin.  He has a deep, husky voice that I find really sexy.”  “Deep,” when we are talking about a voice, is someone who has a voice that is very low, like this: [speaking in a low tone] “Hello there baby.”  That would be a deep voice – and a voice that could get you in  a lot of trouble with your wife!  “Deep” has several different meanings in Eng lish; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  “Husky”  (husky), when we are talking about a voice, is a low sound voice – a deep voice, but it’s sort of attractive.  It’s often used to describe some men’s voices.  Interestingly enough, “husky,” when used to describe someone’s body usually means so meone who is very big, perhaps a little overweight.  But when we ta lk about a voice being husky, it’s usually a positive description.   

Adriana finds the deep, husky voice of Kevin to be sexy, to be sexually exciting or attractive.  Ralph says, “This guy?”  He can’t believe what Adriana is saying. Ralph says Kevin’s “voice is so monotone that it lulls me to  sleep every time I hear it.”  The word “monotone” means always the same no te, always the same tone; perhaps even the same volume, never quiet or loud.   “Mono” means one,  

 so it’s one kind of tone or one kind of note.  A monoto ne voice would be something like this: [speaking in a monotone] “I am speaki ng in a monotone voice.  Please wake up now if you have fallen asleep.”  Ki nd of like a computer voice, I guess.  When we say something “lulls” (lulls) someo ne, we mean that it makes someone feel calm, relaxed, often tired, maybe even  making someone fall asleep. 

Well, Ralph thinks Kevin’s voice is monotone, and it makes him sleep.  Adriana says, “Well, if you don’t like his voice, how about his side kick, Lisa May?”  “How about” means what do you think of his sidekick.  A “sidekick”  (sidekick – one word) is someone who works with another person and help s them, but isn’t as important as the other person.  For example, in the com ics there is Batman and Robin.  Well, Batman is the most important person; Rob in is his sidekick.  On many popular radio shows, at least in the United State s, there are two people that are on the radio: the main person and then someo ne else who is the sidekick that they talk to or make jokes with. 

Adriana says the voice of the Lisa May, Kevin’s sidekick on the radio, is music to her ears.  The expression “to be music to one’s ears” means that something is very pleasant to listen to, something that you enjoy listen ing to.  We hope that ESL Podcast is music to your ears!  It doesn’t mean you necessa rily are listening to music, however.  “Music to your ears” can also be used to  mean that you are giving someone good news or you are hearing good news. 

Ralph responds by saying that Lisa May “has a nice lilt (li lt) in her voice.”  A “lilt” is the way that a voice goes up and down, up and down, h igher and lower.  It’s supposed to make your voice sound more pleasant.  It’s, in some ways, the opposite of monotone.  However, Ralph thinks that Lisa May’s voice is very high- pitched and squeaky.  Something that is “high-pitched” is something that has a sound at a very high note, so high that it could hurt you r ears or be unpleasant.  If I were to speak in a high-pitched voice I might sound, for example, like a woman: [speaking in a high pitch] “Hello.  How are you?”  Pre tty annoying, isn’t it?  A “squeaky” voice is a voice that sounds a little like a mouse;  it’s [squeaking sounds] “ee, ee, ee,” that would be a squeaky voice.  I d on’t have a squeaky voice, so it’s hard for me to imitate that.  Ralph says, “ It can really be grating to listen to her.”  When we say something is “grating” (gra ting) we mean it is annoying, it is unpleasant, it is irritating. 

Adriana says, well, “if you don’t like their voices, what ki nd of voices do you like?” Ralph says, “I like a gravelly voice.”  “Gravelly” (gravelly) is a very low, rough, almost a deep kind of sound, but it’s something that you  could use to describe a  

 woman’s voice as well.  Ralph says, “I like a gravelly voice,  speaking softly and saying...”  – well, what Ralph is referring to here is that sometimes women who are trying to be or make themselves sexually attractive may sp eak in this lower voice.  At least, some men find that voice attractive – fin d it “sexy.” 

Adriana says, “I’m not talking about your fantasies.”  You r “fantasy” is something that you imagine might happen, something you would li ke to happen.  But, of course, Adriana isn’t interested in Ralph’s fantasies abou t women, she says, “I don’t want to know anything about those!”  And neithe r do we! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
