[start of dialogue]

Carol: Hey, where are you going?

Miguel: We can’t sit here doing nothing.

Carol: We have orders to stay here and to keep watc h. You know as well as I do what the consequences are of defying orders.

Miguel: I don’t care what kind of punishment I get.  I can’t sit still and let things happen without an attempt at intervention.

Carol: What are you going to do, enter the fray wit hout a plan?

Miguel: I have a plan. I’m going to stop what’s going on using whatever means necessary.

Carol: By doing what? Have you thought this through ?

Miguel: I’ll get the lay of the land and then formu late some options. Everything will work out.

Carol: And I suppose you expect me to go with you, to stick my neck out, too?

Miguel: That’s up to you. I’m not twisting your arm .

Carol: How do you know that if I stay here, I won’t  squeal on you?

Miguel: I don’t. I guess I just have to rely on you r sense of honor.

Carol: Oh, come on, let’s go.

Miguel: You’re coming with me?

Carol: Against my better judgment!

Carol begins our dialogue by saying, “Hey, where are you going?” Miguel says, “We can’t sit here doing nothing.” Carol says, “We have orders to stay here and keep watch.” So, Carol is asking Miguel where he is  going, and Miguel says that he doesn’t want to just sit there and do nothing, b ut Carol says that the two of them “have orders.” If you say you “have orders,” y ou mean that someone has given you instructions – someone has told you what you are supposed to do, usually someone in authority.

You can think about the military – for example, the  army or the navy – where one of the leaders will give orders to the other member s of the military, telling them what to do. Miguel and Carol’s orders are to keep w atch. The phrasal verb “to keep watch” (watch) means to monitor something – to  observe something, but not to do anything or get involved with that thing.

So, if you are keeping watch, for example, in front  of a building, you are watching to see what is going on, usually because you’re loo king for a problem. If there is a problem, then you’re supposed to call someone els e and that other person will deal with or take care of the problem. Or you might  be keeping watch because you are expecting someone to arrive, and the person  who gave you the orders to keep watch wants you to tell him or her when the ar rival takes place.

Carol says, “You know as well as I do what the cons equences are of defying orders.” A “consequence” is a result of something, something that happens as a result of something else. There’s an old expression , “Ideas have consequences,” that means that when you have certain moral, religi ous, political, or ethical opinions about things, ideas about things, those id eas often have practical results in the real world. They actually will influence the  way people behave, the way people act.

Here, Carol is talking about the consequences “of d efying orders.” “To defy” (defy) means to refuse to do something, to say no t o someone who has authority over you. Carol reminds Miguel that there are conse quences for defying orders. Miguel says, “I don’t care what kind of punishment I get.” A “punishment” is a negative consequence or a negative result, usually something that you get because you did something wrong.

Miguel says, “I can’t sit still and let things happ en without an intervention.” “To sit still” means to not move, to remain in one place. I f you are keeping watch, you may also be sitting still – that is, you’re not mov ing around, you’re just staying where you are. But Miguel says he cannot “sit still  and let things happen without an intervention.”

An “intervention” (intervention) is the act of beco ming involved in something, especially to change the process or the result of s ome action. We could speak of a “military intervention,” where one country sends its army or its military into another country in order to prevent something bad f rom happening in the other country – or at least, that’s what the normal excus e is for military interventions.

We also use the term “intervention” nowadays perhap s more commonly to refer to a situation where a person has a problem with dr ugs or alcohol. The person’s friends and family want to tell this person to stop , to get help, and so they may put this person in a room and all of them together will talk to the person and try to convince the person to get help with his or her dru g or alcohol problem. That’s an “intervention.”

Carol says, “What are you going to do? Enter the fr ay without a plan?” “To enter the fray” (fray) means to become involved in a figh t, argument, or disagreement – to join into a situation that is hostile, or perhap s people are yelling at each other or even fighting physically with each other. Miguel  says, “I have a plan” – I have an idea about what I’m going to do – “I’m going to stop what’s going on using whatever means necessary.”

The word “means” (means) here refers to the method,  the manner, or the approach that you use in order to get something don e. “Whatever means necessary” is used in a situation where you will do  anything. You will do whatever it takes in order to get the result you want to get . Carol is still confused about what Miguel plans to do. She asks, “By doing what?”  – “What exactly are you going to do, Miguel?” she’s asking.

She asks, “Have you thought this through?” “To thin k something through” is to think carefully about something – to think of all t he possible consequences of

your actions, to really understand what you are doi ng, including what might go wrong or what problems you might face as you do thi s action. Miguel then gives us a little bit of his plan. He says, “I’ll get the  lay of the land and then formulate some options. Everything will work out.”

“To get the lay (lay) of the land” means to underst and the way things are organized by looking at the situation or by looking  at a particular place. Physically, “to get the lay of the land” would be t o understand where everything is – where the roads are, where the streets are, where  the houses are – in a given area. It can be used more generally to mean to unde rstand the way things are organized, the way an organization or business is o rganized, for example.

Miguel says that he will “formulate some options.” The verb “to formulate” (formulate) means to come up with or develop someth ing, to think of something. Miguel says, “Everything will work out.” If someone  says, “It’s going to work out,” he means that it’s going to be okay. It’s going to be successful. There aren’t going to be any problems.

Carol says, “And I suppose you expect me to go with  you, to stick my neck out, too?” “To stick your neck out” is an expression mea ning to take a risk, to do something that might cause you harm or injury or pu t you in danger. Miguel says, “That’s up to you,” meaning that’s your decision; I ’m not going to force you. In fact, the next sentence is “I’m not twisting your a rm.”

“To twist (twist) someone’s arm” is to persuade som eone to do something that the person doesn’t really want to do – to force the  person to do something. If you can think of your arm and someone putting your arm behind your back in a painful way, then you understand where this express ion comes from. “To twist someone’s arm” – to make them do something because you are pressuring them.

Carol says, “How do you know that if I stay here” –  if I don’t go with you – “I won’t squeal on you?” “To squeal (squeal) on” someone mea ns to report someone’s bad behavior to someone else – to tell someone else , usually someone in authority, about bad things that someone else has d one.

Miguel says, “I don’t,” meaning I don’t know if you  will squeal on me or not. “I guess I just have to rely” (or depend) “on your sen se of honor.” A “sense of honor” (honor) is wanting to do the right thing, the ethical thing, the moral thing. Carol says, “Oh, come on, let’s go.” Miguel asks, “ You’re coming with me?” He’s surprised that Carol is going to go with him.

Carol says, “Against my better judgment!” The expre ssion “against one’s better judgment” means that you don’t agree with what this  person is saying or what this person wants to do, but you’re going to do it anyway. You’re going to go “against your better judgment” – against your own r eason, against the logic in your own mind, and instead, you’re going to do what  this person wants you to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
