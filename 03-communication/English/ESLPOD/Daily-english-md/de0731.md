This episode is a dialogue between Roberta and John  about vocabulary related to “innuendo,” when we indirectly communicate meani ng to other people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roberta:  You know, my birthday is coming up.

John:  Yeah, I know.  What are you getting at?

Roberta:  Nothing.  I was just thinking that it’s k ind of an important birthday, a major birthday.

John:  Yes, I know.  Spit it out.  What are you dri ving at?

Roberta:  I was just thinking that some people migh t not know what to get me for such an important birthday, since some people don’t  like to put a lot of thought into presents.

John:  What are you implying?  Are you insinuating that I don’t get you good presents for your birthdays?

Roberta:  No, of course not.  I just don’t want you  to have to rack your brain to think of the perfect gift, that’s all.

John:  Just tell me.  What should I get you for you r very important birthday?

Roberta:  What?  Just blurt it out?  I can’t do tha t.  I can give you a hint, but since you love me so much, I’m sure you can read my mind.

John:  That’s where you’re wrong.  If I had a nicke l for every time a woman thought I should be able to read her mind, I’d be t he richest man in the world!  I don’t have an inkling of what you have on your mind .

Roberta:  All right, I’ll make it more than a hint.   I’ll give you three clues.

John:  Great.  That’ll make things crystal clear.

Our dialogue begins with Roberta saying to John, “You know, my birthday is coming up.”  Something that is “coming up” is somet hing that will be happening in the near future, something that will occur soon.  J ohn says, “Yeah, I know.  What are you getting at?”  “To get at” is to say somethi ng indirectly, to communicate something to another person without saying it direc tly.  You’re suggesting something.  Roberta says, “Nothing (she’s not getti ng at anything).  I was just thinking that it’s kind of an important birthday, a  major birthday.”  John says, “Yes, I know.  Spit it out.”  “Spit (spit) it out” is an expression that means say something quickly, stop trying to hide it.  It’s of ten used when someone will talk about something that is embarrassing or difficult, or perhaps critical of the other person.  But when you say “spit it out,” you’re say ing to the person just say it now, directly.  John says, “What are you driving at ?”  “To drive at” means the same as “to get at,” to say indirectly.

Roberta says, “I was just thinking that some people  might not know what to get me for such an important birthday, since some peopl e don’t like to put a lot of thought into presents.”  “Some people,” if you noti ce the way Roberta says it, is a way that we say something about another person with out using their name. We’re really saying “you,” but you’re trying to be polite or perhaps funny by just putting it in this neutral third person – or in thi s case, third people – “some people.”  “Some people (meaning you) might not know  what to get me for such an important birthday, since some people (you, John ) don’t like to put a lot of thought into presents (or gifts).”  “To put a lot of thought into (something)” is to think about something seriously for a long time, gi ve it a lot of thought, a lot of serious considering before making a decision.

John says, “What are you implying?”  “To imply” (im ply) means to strongly suggest something without saying it directly.  Well , John is asking what Roberta is implying.  He says, “Are you insinuating that I don’t get you good presents for your birthdays?”  “To insinuate” (insinuate) means to suggest that something is bad, something is wrong, without saying it directly .  It’s similar to “imply,” but it always has a negative connotation; something bad is  being implied.

 Roberta says, “No, of course not (of course she was n’t insinuating that John gives her bad presents for her birthdays).  I just don’t want you to have to rack your brain to think of the perfect gift, that’s all .”  So, Roberta is saying these things to help John, that’s what she says.  She doe sn’t want John to rack (rack) his brain.  “To rack your brain” means to put a lot  of thought into something, to take a long time to think of something.  We also us e this if we’re having difficulty remembering something or someone.  “I’m racking my brain trying to think of the name of the girl who sat next me in social studies class when I was a senior in high school.”  I think her first name was Linda…Lyd ia…I can’t remember. Anyway, that’s what racking your brain is, trying t o think of something, spending a lot of time and energy doing it.

So Roberta says she’s trying to help John, and John  says, “Just tell me.  What should I get you for your very important birthday?”   Roberta says, “What?  Just blurt it out?”  “To blurt (blurt) (something) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to say something without first thinking carefully about wh at you are saying or how you will say it.  Sometimes people say things, and then  they realize that it was a mistake to tell someone something.  Maybe they’re n ervous, maybe they’re excited; they blurt something out, they say somethi ng they shouldn’t.

Roberta says that she doesn’t really want to blurt it out, to tell John directly.  She says, “I can’t do that.  I can give you a hint, but  since you love me so much, I’m sure you can read my mind.”  A “hint” (hint) is a s mall piece of information that suggests something else.  It’s a clue; it’s to help  you guess something or figure something else out.  “To read someone’s mind” means  to know what the other person is thinking.  So Roberta is saying here that  she can give John a clue – a hint, but because John loves her so much he should be able to read her mind. Now, this is something that many women believe abou t men – wives about their husbands, girlfriends about their boyfriends – that  because they love them they should know what they want for their birthday.  But  of course, we men know this isn’t true!

John says, “That’s where you’re wrong.  If I had a nickel for every time a woman thought I should be able to read her mind, I’d be t he richest man in the world!” This phrase, “if I had a nickel (which is five cent s) for every time something happens, I’d be rich,” the idea is that this has ha ppened to you many, many times.  If each time it happened you got a very sma ll amount, say a nickel, which is five American cents, you would be rich because it has happened to you so many times.  You could say “if I had a dollar” or “ if I had a quarter.”  It has to be a small amount of money.  John is saying that many wo men in his life have thought that he should be able to read their minds.  He say s, “I don’t have an inkling of

what you have on your mind.”  An “inkling” (inkling ) is a little bit of knowledge, a small idea; you know a little bit, but not very muc h.  John says he doesn’t have an inkling.  He doesn’t have any idea what is on Ro berta’s mind, what she’s thinking, what she wants for her birthday.

Roberta says, “All right, I’ll make it more than a hint.  I’ll give you three clues.”  A “clue” (clue) is a piece of information that helps you solve a problem, usually when there’s some sort of crime or mystery involved .  Roberta’s going to give John three clues to what she wants to have for her birthday.  Notice we say “clues to (something).”  You have clues to the gift , in this case.

John says, “Great.  That’ll make things crystal cle ar.”  The expression “crystal (crystal) clear” means easy to understand, no doubt  about something.  It’s obvious almost; you know exactly what it is.  That’ s something that is crystal clear.  “The professor gave crystal clear definitio ns about what he was talking about,” they were easy to understand.  We’re not su re here if John is being sarcastic, if he’s making a joke, because of course  a clue is not the same as the actual answer to the problem.  But we hope John wil l buy the right gift and figure it out!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Roberta:  You know, my birthday is coming up.

John:  Yeah, I know.  What are you getting at?

Roberta:  Nothing.  I was just thinking that it’s k ind of an important birthday, a major birthday.
