[start of dialogue]

Fareed:  Where are you going?

Amber:  I’m going to meet Peter.

Fareed:  When are you going to tell Lily?

Amber:  Tell her what?

Fareed:  You know what – that you’re dating her ex.  S he’s not going to take it well.

Amber:  I don’t know why she would object.  They broke u p over a year ago and they’ve both moved on.

Fareed:  Peter has moved on, but Lily still has a thing  for him.  You know that as well as I do.

Amber:  She never said that he was off-limits.  It’s not  like we’re sneaking around behind her back.

 Fareed:  Aren’t you?  She’s one of your best friends a nd you haven’t clued her in on the two of you yet.  If you don’t tell her soon, wh en she finds out, all hell is going to break loose.

Amber:  That’s not fair.  If there were a statute of limitations on ex-boyfriends, then we’re well past that.  He’s fair game.

Fareed:  That’s not how she’s going to see it.  If you a sk me, you have two options: break it off with Peter or tell Lily now, bef ore she finds out from someone else.  Tell her the truth and let the chips fall wher e they may.

Amber:  That’s easy for you to say.  You’re not facing Li ly’s wrath.  I think I’ll keep this under wraps for now, thank you very much.

Fareed:  Fine, but it’s your funeral.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Fareed saying to Amber, “Wher e are you going?” Amber says, “I’m going to meet Peter.”  Fareed says, “Whe n are you going to tell Lily?”  Lily’s a girl – a woman.  Amber says, “Tell her w hat?”  Fareed says, “You know what (you know what I am talking about) – that you’ re dating her ex.”  So to review, Fareed, the man, is a friend with Amber, the woman in the dialogue. Amber is dating – is going on a romantic evening or aft ernoon with Peter.  Peter used be the boyfriend of Lily, another women, who is no t in the dialogue.  So, we would say Amber is dating Lily’s ex.  Here, I think, her e x-boyfriend – her previous or former boyfriend.

Fareed says that Lily is not going to take it well.  “To take (something) well” means to handle or manage a negative situation calmly, p ositively, without getting angry or upset.  Usually when you tell someone bad news, if they say, “Oh, okay,” they may be very disappointed but they don’t sh ow it – they take it well.  Well, Fareed says that Lily is not going to take t he news that Amber is dating her ex well.  Amber says, “I don’t know why (Lily) would object,” there’s no reason for her to object.  “To object” means to oppose so mething, to do or say something that shows that you don’t agree with this, tha t you think it’s a bad idea. The word “object” has a couple of different meanings in  English however; make sure you look at the Learning Guide for some additional  explanations of that word.

 Amber says, “I don’t know why she would object.  They (mea ning Lily and Peter) broke up over a year ago and they’ve both moved on.”  “To  break up” in this dialogue means to end a romantic relationship.  You’re  boyfriend and girlfriend for a year – six months, and then she says to you, “I don’t  love you anymore,” or “I found someone who’s better looking and makes more mon ey, and I am leaving you.  I’m going to break up with you.”  I think that’s w hich she said to me, I’m not sure, something like that!  Well, Amber is saying that Pe ter and Lily broke up over a year ago, a long time ago, and that they’ve both  moved on.  “To move on” is a phrasal verb meaning that you’ve stopped thinking a bout something in the past and you are living your normal life again.  If your  girlfriend leaves you, you may be very upset for a week or two weeks, or a month or t wo months, but eventually you have to move on.  You have to get over it, forget about it; find another fish in the sea, as we say.  The word “move” has m any different meanings in English; please take a look at our Learning Guide, again, for more explanations.

Fareed says to Amber, “Peter has moved on (Peter is no l onger thinking about his ex-girlfriend Lily), but Lily still has a thing for h im (for Peter).”  The expression “to have a thing for (someone)” means that you are rom antically attracted to that person.  You’re interested in that person romantically:  “He has a thing for his boss’s daughter.”  Probably not a good idea – unless, of course, you want to take over the company, and then you should probably pursue tha t – go ahead with that!  Lily still has a thing for Peter, and Fareed says,  “You know that as well as I do.”  He’s saying to Amber you already know that Lily has n ot moved on.

Amber says, “She (Lily) never said that he (Peter) was off -limits.”  “To be off- limits” means to be not allowed, prohibited, forbidde n.  It could be a thing, it could be a place that is off-limits; you cannot go there.  Amb er says, “It’s not like we’re sneaking around behind her back.”  “It’s not like” means i t is not the case, or it is not true that we’re sneaking around behind her back.  “ To sneak (sneak) around behind (someone’s) back” – notice it’s “around” and “be hind” together – “to sneak around behind (someone’s) back” means to do something wit hout another person knowing, to hide what you are doing, to try not to let someone know what you are doing.

So, they’re not sneaking around behind Lily’s back.  Faree d says, “Aren’t you? She’s one of your best friends and you haven’t clued her  in on the two of you yet.”  “To clue (someone) in” is a phrasal verb meaning to give someone a little bit of information about something, to tell someone w hat is happening.  Fareed is saying that Amber has not told Lily that she, Amber, is d ating Lily’s ex-boyfriend Peter – she hasn’t clued her in.  He says, “If you don’t  tell her soon, when she

 finds out, all hell is going to break loose.”  So, if A mber does not tell Lily about her dating Peter, Fareed is saying that when Lily finds out on her own all hell is going to break loose.  The phrase “all hell is going to  break loose” is an informal one.  The word “hell” is usually not used in formal or polite conversation, unless you are talking about the place hell, where in the Chr istian religion you go if you have been bad in this life.  But as a general rule, w e don’t say “hell” in polite conversation.  So this is an informal phrase; it’s used to mean that there will be a major or very big problem, and people are going to ge t very angry, very upset when this thing happens.  “All hell is going to break l oose” means once people find out they’re going to be angry, they’re going to b e mad, they’re going to do something about it.

Amber says, “That’s not fair (that’s not just or right).  If there were a statute of limitations on ex-boyfriends, then we’re well past that.   He’s fair game.”  A “statute of limitations” is a legal term – an official  term that describes the maximum amount of time during which you can take some leg al action.  For example, if you steal someone’s car and the police do no t find you – do not catch you, they have only a certain number of years to find you.   If after, let’s say, five years they don’t find you, there may be a statute – which is another word for a law – a statute of limitations that says after five years,  if the police don’t catch you and don’t try to put you in jail, then they cannot  try to catch you and put you in jail after it.  You are basically free.  Here, Ambe r is using the expression to mean that there isn’t a time limit on when you can da te someone’s ex-boyfriend, and if there were – if one did exist – it has been a l ong time and therefore we are well past that; we are past the time when I have to wa it before I can date this ex- boyfriend.  “He’s fair game.”  “Fair game” means that something is allowed; something can be had or used by anyone, not just one per son.  When you say something is “fair game” you mean anybody can take it; in  this case, anybody can date Peter.

Fareed says, “That’s not how (Lily’s) going to see it.  If  you ask me (if you ask my advice), you have two options (two things you can do): brea k it off with Peter or tell Lily now, before she finds out from someone else.”  “To break (something) off” is a phrasal verb meaning to end a relationship o r to end an agreement that you have with someone else.  In this case, Fareed is saying  either Amber should break up with Peter or she should tell Lily about it no w.  “Tell her the truth,” Fareed says, “and let the chips fall where they may.”  T his is a common expression: “to let the chips (chips) fall where they may. ”  This means to accept the consequences, the results of your actions; to see what h appens especially when the results – the consequences may be negative.  Thi s expression comes from card playing like they do in Las Vegas.  When you are betting money –

 when you are putting your money down saying that you’re going to win, for example, a game of poker.  The “chips” are round, usual ly plastic, colored disks that represent money.  So you don’t actually put a hundr ed dollars on the table in Las Vegas if you are gambling, you would have a chip tha t would be worth a hundred dollars – would be a symbol for the 100 dollar s.  But the expression is used generally, “let the chips fall where they may,” to mean that you have to accept the consequences of your actions, even though they are negative.

Amber says, “That’s easy for you to say.  You’re not facing L ily’s wrath.”  “Wrath” (wrath) is anger, someone who is very upset.  She’s saying t hat Lily will be very upset when she tells her.  Amber says, “I think I’ll keep  this under wraps for now, thank you very much.”  “Thank you very much” means I don’t want your opinion, or I am not going to follow your advice.  “To keep (som ething) under wraps” (wraps) means to keep something secret, not to let anyone  else know about it: “I’m going to keep this under wraps.”  Usually it’s a bad  idea to have secrets, especially with your friends, girlfriends, wives, and so for th.  It’s a very bad idea; trust me when I tell you!

Fareed says, “Fine (okay), but it’s your funeral.”  A “fun eral” is a ceremony you have when someone dies; to remember them you all get to gether and you have this funeral, this sort of meeting where you remember the person who died.  The expression “it’s your funeral” is an informal one meaning  that you think the other person’s actions are going to cause a lot of problems, no t necessarily death, but you’re not going to interfere with their decision.  Wh en someone says “it’s your funeral,” they’re saying to you something bad is going to  happen to you but it’s none of my business, I’m not going to interfere, I’m n ot going to try to stop you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

I don’t think anyone will object if I thank the writer of the script for this episode, Dr. Lucy Tse.  Thank you, Lucy.
