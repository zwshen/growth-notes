This episode is a dialogue between Donald and Carla  about living on the fringes of society. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carla: Why do those teenagers have to dress like th at? Don’t they want to fit in?

Donald: Maybe they feel marginalized and they’re sh owing their feelings of alienation through their clothes.

Carla: That’s just a bunch of psychobabble. Nobody is treating them like second- class citizens. They’re choosing to set themselves apart, to make themselves outcasts.

Donald: Maybe they don’t feel they have the same ac cess and privileges that other people do because of social class, religious beliefs, or other factors.

Carla: Nobody is shunning them. They choose to live  on the fringe of society. They need to stop making themselves conspicuous and  integrate into society.

Donald: What if they doubt they’d be accepted?

Carla: That’s ridiculous.

Donald: Would you want one of them as your neighbor ?

Carla: Well, I . . . well . . .

Donald: I think I’ve proved my point.

This episode is called “Living on the Fringes (frin ges) of Society.” The “fringes of society” refers to the people who are not accepted as normal members of the community, or who for a variety of reasons don’t fe el like they’re part of a country or a society – a group of people. Carla begins our dialogue by asking, “Why do those teenagers have to dress like that? Don’t they  want to fit in?” “To fit (fit) in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to be similar to the people around you, to be accepted by the people around you and feel comforta ble with others.

Donald says, “Maybe they feel marginalized and they ’re showing their feelings of alienation through their clothes,” or through their  clothing. “To be marginalized” (marginalized) is to be treated as though you were unimportant or not necessary for a given group. The verb “to marginalize” someon e means to treat them in a way that makes them feel unimportant. It’s a word m ostly used in politics and sociology more than in everyday conversation. “Alie nation” (alienation) is a feeling of not belonging or feeling part of a group .

Donald thinks that maybe these teenagers are dressi ng so differently from others because they don’t feel like they’re part of the gr oup. They have feelings of “alienation.” Notice that that word “alienation” ha s the word “alien” inside of it. “Alien” is what we might use to describe a person f rom another country, a foreigner. We might also describe a being from anot her planet, if such beings exist, as being “aliens.” E.T., from the movie of t he 1970s, was an alien. He was from another planet. My neighbor, I believe, is an alien. I think he’s from Mars. Yeah, seriously.

Anyway, Carla says to Donald, “That’s just a bunch of psychobabble.” “A bunch of” is an informal way of saying “a lot of.” “Psych obabble” (psychobabble) refers to terms or words that people use that come from ps ychology or psychotherapy, but that don’t really mean anything or that are not  used very accurately by non- psychologists. It’s what we might call a “derogator y term.” It’s an insulting term to describe the way someone is using language inaccura tely.

Carla says, “Nobody is treating them,” meaning thes e teenagers, “like second- class citizens.” “Second-class citizens” refers to people who are not perhaps respected or treated the way they should be. It mig ht also refer to a group of people who are discriminated against in a given soc iety or culture because of the way they look or because of who they are. But Carla  says these teenagers are not being treated like second-class citizens.

 She continues, “They’re choosing to set themselves apart, to make themselves outcasts.” “To set yourself apart” means to do some thing or say something that makes you seem different from other people. “To mak e yourself an outcast” (outcast) is to make yourself so different from oth er people that other people don’t accept you, that other people reject you. An “outcast” is a person not accepted, or rejected, by people in a given communi ty or society.

Donald says, “Maybe they don’t feel they have the s ame access and privileges that other people do because of social class, relig ious beliefs, or other factors.” “Access” (access) is the ability to get something, is the ability to be able to obtain something. “Privilege” (privilege) refers to some a dvantage that you have over other people, often something that perhaps you don’ t earn but are given because of circumstances or situations that have nothing to  do with how smart you are or how hard you worked. That’s usually how the word is  used nowadays.

If someone talks about a person’s “privileges,” he’ s talking about things that person has that he didn’t have to work for, or perh aps didn’t have to earn. He got them just because of his parents or the place in wh ich he was born. Donald talks about social class and religious beliefs. “Social ( social) class” refers to the group of people you belong to based on how much money you  make.

In the United States, we sometimes talk about the “ upper class,” referring to rich people; the “middle class,” referring to people who  are neither rich nor poor; and the “lower class” or the “working class” – people w ho are usually poor. The term “social class” might refer not just perhaps to how much money you make, but also to the certain kinds of values or the certain kind of culture that people in your class or in your group might have.

“Religious beliefs” refer to the things that you be lieve in terms of God and the existence of a higher or supernatural being. People  around the world have different religious beliefs, and sometimes these re ligious beliefs may cause problems with those in the community who don’t share those beliefs. Carla says, however, “Nobody is shunning them.” “To shun” (shun ) someone is to reject or ignore someone. It might include even not talking t o the person or allowing the person into your house.

Carla continues, “They,” again referring to the tee nagers, “choose to live on the fringe of society.” We described what we mean by “t he fringes of society” earlier. “They need to stop making themselves conspicuous an d integrate into society.” “To be conspicuous” (conspicuous) is to be easily n oticed, to stand out, to be obvious. The teenagers, by dressing differently, are “conspicuous” – everyone

notices them. Carla says instead they should “integ rate (integrate) into society.” “To integrate” means to combine two things together  so that they become one unit or one group.

Donald says, “What if they doubt they’d be accepted ?” “To be accepted” means to be welcomed, to be appreciated as a member of a group. Carla says, “That’s ridiculous,” meaning that’s silly. Donald says, “Wo uld you want one of them as your neighbor?” In other words, he’s asking Carla i f she would accept one of these teenagers living next door to her, being her neighbor.

Carla doesn’t answer right away. She says, “Well, I  . . . well . . .” You can tell the answer is no. Donald then says, “I think I’ve prove d my point.” “To prove (prove) your point (point)” is to demonstrate that what you  just said is true, that what you just said is correct. “To prove your point” is to p rovide evidence that shows that what you are saying is true.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
