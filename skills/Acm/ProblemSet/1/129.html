<P>
You have been employed by the organisers of a Super Krypton Factor Contest 
in which contestants have very high mental and physical abilities.  In one 
section of the contest the contestants are tested on their ability to recall a 
sequence of characters which has been read to them by the Quiz Master.  
Many of the contestants are very good at recognising patterns.  Therefore, in 
order to add some difficulty to this test, the organisers have decided that 
sequences containing certain types of repeated subsequences should not be 
used.  However, they do not wish to remove all subsequences that are 
repeated, since in that case no single character could be repeated.  This in 
itself would make the problem too easy for the contestants.  Instead it is 
decided to eliminate all sequences containing an occurrence of two 
adjoining identical subsequences.  Sequences containing such an occurrence 
will be called ``easy''.  Other sequences will be called ``hard''.
<P>
For example, the sequence ABACBCBAD is easy, since it contains an 
adjoining repetition of the subsequence CB.  Other examples of easy 
sequences are:
<P>
<UL><LI> BB<LI> ABCDACABCAB<LI> ABCDABCD
</UL>
<P>
Some examples of hard sequences are:
<P>
<UL><LI> D<LI> DC<LI> ABDAB<LI> CBABCBA
</UL><H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input and Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
In order to provide the Quiz Master with a potentially unlimited source of 
questions you are asked to write a program that will read input lines that 
contain integers <I>n</I> and <I>L</I> (in that order), where <I>n</I> &gt; 0 and <I>L</I> is in the 
range  <IMG WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline39" SRC="129img1.gif"  > , and for each input line prints out the <I>n</I>th hard 
sequence (composed of letters drawn from the first <I>L</I> letters in the 
alphabet), in increasing alphabetical order (alphabetical ordering here corresponds to the normal ordering encountered in a dictionary), 
followed (on the next line) by the length of that sequence.  The first 
sequence in this ordering is A.  You may assume that for given <I>n</I> and <I>L</I> 
there do exist at least <I>n</I> hard sequences.
<P>
For example, with <I>L</I> = 3, the first 7 hard sequences are:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
A <BR> 
AB <BR> 
ABA <BR> 
ABAC <BR> 
ABACA <BR> 
ABACAB <BR> 
ABACABA
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
As each sequence is potentially very long, split it into groups of four (4) 
characters separated by a space.  If there are more than 16 such groups, 
please start a new line for the 17th group.
<P>
Therefore, if the integers 7 and 3 appear on an input line, the output lines 
produced should be
<P>
<PRE>ABAC ABA
7</PRE>
<P>
Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes.  Your program may 
assume a maximum sequence length of 80.
