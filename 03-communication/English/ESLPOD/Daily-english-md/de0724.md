This episode is called “Being Impolite in Conversat ion.”  It’s a dialogue between Angela and Ronny talking about someone who is not very nice when they are having a conversation with someone else.  Let’s get  started.

[start of dialogue]

Angela:  Ugh!  I hate talking to Rebecca.  Every ti me I ask her a question, she ignores me or sneers at me.

Ronny:  Are you sure it’s not your imagination?  Sh e’s perfectly nice to me.

Angela:  It’s not my imagination.  When I try to te ll her something, she cuts me off.  When I try to explain something to her, she’s  short with me or talks over me. I always get the feeling that she’s looking down he r nose at me.

Ronny:  Maybe she feels threatened by you.

Angela:  How so?

Ronny:  You’re younger, smarter, and better educate d.  She might feel like you’re after her job.

Angela:  But I’m not!  I just started here and I do n’t have any designs on replacing her.

Ronny:  And you’re prettier than she is.

Angela:  What does that have to do with anything, e ven if it were true?

Ronny:  Well, she’s had a thing for me for a while and…

Angela:  And she thinks I’m her competition.  No wo nder she’s so standoffish with me.  I’ll just make it clear that I won’t stan d in her way.

Ronny:  You won’t?

Angela:  Huh?

Ronny:  Never mind.

Angela begins by saying to Ronny, “Ugh!  I hate tal king to Rebecca.  Every time I ask her a question, she ignores me or sneers at me. ”  “To ignore (someone)” is not to pay attention to them, not to talk to them o r even act as if they are there with you.  “To sneer” (sneer) means to smile in a m ean way, or to make an expression with your face – with your mouth that in dicates that you are being mean or unkind.

Ronny says, “Are you sure it’s not your imagination ?”  “Imagination” is our ability to invent new things in our mind, to think of new t hings.  Ronny is asking if perhaps Angela is imagining what Rebecca is doing, meaning Rebecca isn’t really doing it, it’s just Angela who thinks she is .  Ronny says, “She (Rebecca) is perfectly nice to me.”  “Perfectly,” here, is used to emphasize what you are saying, especially when something is in doubt or is  in question.  “Perfect” has a number of meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more of those.

Angela says, “It’s not my imagination.  When I tell  her something, she cuts me off.”  “To cut (someone) off” is a phrasal verb mea ning to interrupt someone, to start speaking before they are finished speaking.  We use this expression, “to cut (someone) off,” in conversation; we also use it, pe rhaps a little more commonly, in driving.  To cut someone off when you are drivin g is to drive right in front of them, to go from one lane to another and cause them  to have to slow down because you have gone right front of their car, or you have come very close to their car, too close for safety.  That’s to cut som eone off on the freeway or on a road.  It happens every day here in Los Angeles, an d in every city where there are cars I would guess.

Angela says, “When I try to explain something to he r, she’s short with me or talks over me.”  Not only does Rebecca cut her off – inte rrupt her conversation, when

Angela is trying to explain something to Rebecca, “ she is short with me.”  “To be short with (someone)” means to give very short answ ers that seem unfriendly. Someone says to you, “So, how was your weekend?” an d you say, “Fine.”  And they say, “Oh.  Tell me what you did?” and you say,  “Nothing.”  That would be, perhaps, being short with someone, or saying someth ing in a way that is slightly angry – that you are angry at that person or upset.   “To talk over (someone)” means to talk while the other person is still talki ng.  “To cut (someone) off” means to interrupt them, to make them stop talking so tha t you can talk.  “To talk over (someone)” is to talk often at a higher volume – lo uder – while that person is still talking.  You’re trying to get them to stop talking , but if they don’t stop talking you just continue talking yourself; you talk over them.   This happens on political discussion shows on television all the time now in the United States, something that became popular about, oh, 30 years ago I would  guess, and now everyone talks over everyone else.  And of course, if you are talking and the other person is talking, there’s nobody listening!

Angela says, “I always get the feeling (I always th ink) that she’s looking down her nose at me.”  “To look down your nose at (someone)”  means to think that you are better than the other person, to think that you are  superior to another person. Ronny says, “Maybe she (Rebecca) feels threatened b y you.”  “To feel threatened by (someone)” in this case means to feel  challenged, as though someone wants to remove you or replace you.  This c ould be especially true if the person you are talking to is your boss or someo ne above you in position in the company.  If they feel threatened by you, they think that maybe you will come and take their job or their position.

Angela says to Ronny’s statement, “How so?”  “How s o?” is a question meaning please give me more examples of what you are talkin g about, or give me more information.  When you don’t understand what someon e is saying, and you want them to tell you more you might use this question.  You may hear someone say, for example, “That is a terrible grocery store,” an d you say, “How so?”  And they say, “Well, they don’t have any good fruit.  The me at department never has enough chicken.  The people there are not friendly. ”  Those are reasons why it is such a bad grocery store.  So, “How so?” tells the person to do give you more information.

Ronny then gives Angela more information about why he thinks Rebecca feels threatened by her.  He says, “You (Angela) are youn ger, smarter, and better educated.  She might feel like you’re after her job .”  “To be after (something)” means to want to get it, to try to do something to get something.  “He is after his best friend’s girlfriend.”  He wants to get the gir lfriend to be his girlfriend, kind of like that song in the 1980s by The Cars: “She’s my best friend’s girlfriend / And

she used to be mine.”  That’s a little different st ory; see, it used to be his girlfriend, and now the girlfriend is the girlfrien d of his best friend.  Not really a good situation I think, if you want to stay friends  with someone!

Anyway, we’re talking about Angela and Rebecca.  Re becca feels threatened by Angela because, Ronny says, Angela is smarter, youn ger, and better educated. Angela says she’s not after Rebecca’s job.  She say s, “I just started here and I don’t have any designs on replacing her.”  “To have  designs on (something)” means to plan to do or get something, often by doing something secret or dishonest – not honest.  “I have designs on my best  friend’s girlfriend.”  I want to try to get her away from him, and I’m going to do s omething tricky or secret to make that happen.

Ronny says, “And you’re prettier than she is.”  Tha t is, Angela is prettier than Rebecca.  Angela says, “What does that have to do w ith anything, even if it were true?” meaning why is that important that I may be prettier than she is.  Ronny says, “Well, she’s had a thing for me for a while a nd…”  “To have a thing for (someone)” means to be interested in someone romant ically.  “I have a thing for my best friend’s girlfriend.”  See, we keep coming back to that example!  So, that’s one reason why Rebecca doesn’t like Angela, because Angela is prettier, and Rebecca likes Ronny and Rebecca thinks that Ron ny will become interested in Angela instead of in her.

Angela understands now.  She says, “And she (Rebecc a) thinks I’m her competition,” meaning the two of them are trying to  get Ronny, and Angela is going to compete against Rebecca.  She’s going to f ight against Rebecca, if you will, to get Ronny.  Angela then says, “No wonder ( meaning it is no surprise, it is not surprising) she’s so standoffish with me.”  “To  be standoffish” (standoffish – one word) means to be very unfriendly, to be very f ormal with someone when you should be, perhaps, informal and friendly with them.  “To be standoffish” means to be not very welcoming of another person.

Angela says, “I’ll just make it clear (that is, I’l l explain to Rebecca clearly) that I won’t stand in her way.”  “To stand in (someone’s) way” means to prevent them from doing something, to try to stop them from doing something.  Angela is going to tell Rebecca that she, Angela, will not stand in  her way, meaning she is not going to try to get Ronny interested in her romanti cally.

Ronny says, “You won’t?”  Ronny, of course, is surp rised; he wants Angela to be interested in him, obviously.  Angela says, “Huh?”  She doesn’t understand. When we don’t understand something, an informal way  of expressing that is with the following sound: “Huh?” spelled (huh).  Ronny s ays, “Never mind.”  “Never

mind” is a phrase we use when someone doesn’t want to repeat or explain something he has just said, either because it isn’t  very important or because you think the other person won’t understand it.  Ronny is disappointed when he finds out that Angela isn’t really romantically intereste d in him, so when Angela doesn’t understand what Ronny is really saying, he says, “N ever mind.”  He doesn’t want to explain it to her; of course, that would be some what embarrassing to Ronny.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

I don’t have any designs on the job of scriptwriter  here at ESL Podcast.  That’s because it’s done by someone younger, smarter, and better educated than I am, Dr. Lucy Tse.
