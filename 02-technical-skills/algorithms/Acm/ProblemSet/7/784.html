<P>
A  maze  of  rectangular  rooms  is  represented  on  a  two
dimensional  grid as illustrated in figure 1a. Each point of  the
grid is represented by a character. The points of room walls  are
marked by the same character which can be any printable character
different  than `<TT>*</TT>', `<TT>_</TT>'  and space. In figure 1 this character is
`<TT>X</TT>'. All the other points of the grid are  marked
by spaces.

All  rooms  of  the maze are equal sized with  all  walls  3
points  wide  and 1 point thick as illustrated in  figure  2.  In
addition,  a wall is shared on its full length by  the  separated
rooms.  The  rooms  can  communicate  through  doors,  which  are
positioned in the middle of walls. There are no outdoor doors.

Figure 2. A room with 3 doors
</DIV>

<P>
Your  problem is to paint all rooms of a maze which  can  be
visited  starting from a given room, called the `start room' which
is  marked by a star (`<TT>*</TT>') positioned in the middle of the
room. A room  can be visited from another room if there is a door
on the wall which separates the rooms. By convention, a room is
painted if  its  entire surface, including the doors, is  marked
by  the character `<TT>#</TT>' as shown in figure 1b.

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The program input is a text file structured as follows:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The first line contains a positive integer which shows  the
number of mazes to be painted.
<DT>2.
<DD>The rest of the file contains the mazes.
</DL>

<P>
The lines of the input file can be of different length.  The
text  which represents a maze is terminated by a separation  line
full  of underscores (`<TT>_</TT>'). There are at most 30 lines and
at most 80 characters in a line for each maze

<P>
The program reads the mazes from the input file, paints them
and writes the painted mazes on the standard output.

<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The  output  text of a painted maze has the same format  as  that
which  has  been  read for that maze,  including  the  separation
lines. The example below illustrates a simple input  which
contains a single maze and the corresponding output.
