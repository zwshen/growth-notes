Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 238: Traveling Off-Season.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 238.  Hello, I'm your host Dr. Jeff McQ uillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.    Just a reminder that ESL Podcast now has a store on our website, where you can download several new premium courses.  These are special courses that we think you'll be interested in.

You can now also purchase individual Learning Guides from our ESL Podcast Store.  Our topic in this episode is taking a trip or a vacation.  Let's get started.  > Kavita:  What I wouldn’t give to get away for a little vacation!  Bill:  Me, too, but we can’t afford it.    Kavita:  Oh, I don’t know.  It’s off-season in a lot of popular places right now, so it may be doable.    Bill:  Maybe.  We’d have to find some pretty deep discounts.  There is a big advantage to traveling during the low season, though.  It’s a lot less crowded.    Kavita:  Yeah, I like that.  I’ll see if I can find a package deal that includes airfare and lodgings.  That may give us the best deal.       Bill:  We have one thing going for us.  We have flexible travel dates, which should make it easier to take advantage of any special promotions.  Kavita:  That’s true.  I’m start looking online and I’ll let you know what I find.  Bill:  I know what a good bargain hunter you are, so if anyone can find a good deal, it’s you.
