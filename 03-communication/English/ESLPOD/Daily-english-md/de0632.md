This episode is called “Negotiating a Business Deal” (a b usiness agreement).  It’s a dialogue between Gia and Logan.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gia:  Why are the negotiations on this deal taking so long?  I thought we would be putting the finishing touches on it by now.

Logan:  The other side is holding out for more concession s.  I don’t know what they’re thinking.  They made some pretty big demands at t he start and I think we’ve given in to most of them.  Now they’re countering  with even more demands.

Gia:  They probably know that they have us over a barrel .  After all of the time and money we’ve put into this deal, they know that we do n’t want to walk away.

Logan:  That’s true and that’s why we’re still at the table, but they may be pushing too hard.  In the end, I don’t think we’ll cave  on those additional concessions.

Gia:  So the entire thing is touch-and-go right now?

Logan:  That’s how I would characterize it.  If I were  you, I wouldn’t make any long-term plans.

Gia:  Duly noted.  I won’t run out and buy that new h ouse and those three new cars.

Gia begins by asking, “Why are the negotiations on this d eal taking so long?” “Negotiation” is the process of trying to reach an agree ment – trying to agree with another person or another business, when each side “compr omises,” that is, each side gives in a little.  For example I want to buy a  new car and the person selling it says, “It’s 20,000 dollars,” and I say, “Oh, th at’s too much.  How about 18,000 dollars?” and the person selling – the seller – says, “Oh, no.  I could only go as low as 19,000 dollars,” and you say, “I’ll give you 18,500 cash.  I have the money with me,” and he says, “Okay, I’ll take it.”  That’ s a negotiation. Negotiations are always about time, power, and knowledg e.  That is, if you have a long time to wait or you need something done right away, if you have knowledge about what the other person wants, and fina lly if you have some other sort of influence or power over that person, all those t hings will affect your negotiation.

Gia wants to know why the negotiations on this deal (thi s agreement) are taking so long – are lasting such a long time.  She says, “I thou ght we would be putting the finishing touches on it by now.”  The expression “to put the finishing (or final) touches on (something)” means to be making small changes i n order to finish something so that it’s perfect.  The idea is that most o f the important work has already been completed.

Logan says, “The other side (the people they are negotia ting with) is holding out for more concessions.”  “To hold out” is a two-word phra sal verb meaning to delay agreeing to something because you are waiting to receive something more; usually we say you “hold out for” something.  For example,  someone wants to offer you a job and they offer you 50,000 dollars a yea r, and you say, “Uh, I’m not too sure.  Let me think about it,” and you wait, and yo u wait.  You are holding out for more money.  The boss may call you back and say, “Well, I’m sorry.  I need to make a decision, it’s been a week,” and you say, “Just one more day,” and he says, “Okay.  Just one more day.”  As time goes on the boss be comes more and more desperate.  He need to hire someone, and so you m ay get what you want because you have made him wait; you have used time to your advantage in the negotiation.  The same is true when you go to buy, for example, a new car at a place that sells a lot of cars.  The more time you can take with the salesperson, the more likely they will be to negotiate with you.  B ecause they’ve spent all that time with you they don’t want to have you walk away, and they having wasted an hour for example on trying to sell you a car.  Well, the  other side is holding out for concessions.  “Concessions” are things that you agree to do in order to reach an agreement.  It’s like a compromise; you say, “Well, okay.  I can’t give you more

 than 50,000 dollars (as the boss), but I can give you an extra week of vacation time.”  That would be a concession.

Logan says, “I don’t know what they’re thinking (the othe r side).  They made some pretty big demands at the start and I think we’ve gi ven in to most of them.” “Some pretty big demands” means some very large demands, where “demand” is something that you say you must have – I cannot do this dea l without it.  Logan says their company has already given in to most of their dem ands.  By the way, the word “demand” has a couple of different meanings;  the other meanings you can find in our Learning Guide.  “To give in” is a two -word phrasal verb meaning to agree to do what someone else wants you to do even t hough you don’t really want to do it.  So the parent who has a child who says, “Mommy, Mommy, I want to go to the store!  I want to go to the store!  I wa nt to!  I want to!  I want to!  I want to!”  Mommy can either say, “No, go to your room.   I’m not letting you go to the store,” or she can give in; she can say, “Okay.  You can  go to the store.” Nowadays, most parents just give in, or so it seems – so it  appears to me.  You know, when I was young…oh, never mind!

Logan says the other side is countering with even more dem ands.  “To counter” is when someone makes you a proposal: “I will sell you this car for 20,000 dollars,” and you say, “No.  I…I only want to pay 18,000 dollars.”  Your proposal is a counter proposal: he says 20,000; you say something diff erent.  That something different that the other person says is their counter proposal.  The verb is “to counter,” to offer something else instead of the original proposal.

Gia says, “They probably know that they have us over a barr el.”  The expression “to have (someone) over a barrel” (barrel) means to be in a situation where someone is very uncomfortable, or to be in a situation where you can beat the other person or take advantage of them knowing that you  will win.  For example, you live in an apartment and the person who owns the a partment raises your rent, but if you don’t have anywhere else to go or if you need to stay in that apartment he has you over a barrel; he has you in a situa tion where he can get what he wants because you don’t have the power to move.   In this case, the other side has knowledge about the situation of Gia and  Logan’s company, and they have power – they have them over a barrel.

Gia says, “After all of the time and money we’ve put int o this deal, they know that we don’t want to walk away.”  This is the idea I was tal king about earlier.  Gia and Logan’s company has spent a lot of time and money negotia ting this agreement, so they don’t want to waste that time and money – they d on’t want to walk away.

 “To walk away” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop  the negotiations, to end the discussion.

Logan says, “That’s true and that’s why we’re still at the  table.”  “To be at the table” means to be continuing to participate in the ne gotiations – to continue to talk to them.  Logan says, “they may be pushing too hard ( meaning they may be trying to do too much – trying to get too much).  In the end, I don’t think we’ll cave on those additional concessions.”  “To cave” (cave) as a verb  means to agree to do what the other person wants you to do just so you can reach an agreement; “to give in” or “to give up” are also ways of saying same  thing.  Gia says, “So the entire thing (the entire negotiation) is touch-and-go  right now?”  “Touch-and-go” is something that could fall apart at any time; it’s some thing, we would say, that is very fragile.  “To be fragile” means you could break it e asily.  Well, the negotiations are fragile – they’re touch-and-go.

Logan says, “That’s how I would characterize it (meaning t hat’s how I would describe it).  If I were you, I wouldn’t make any long-t erm plans (plans into the future).”  Gia says, “Duly noted.”  That phrase, “duly (d uly) noted,” is used to show that you have heard and understood what the other person has said and will think about it.  We use this phrase especially if we  need to make a decision about something.  Gia says, “Duly noted.  I won’t run ou t and buy that new house and those three new cars.”  “I won’t run out” means I w on’t go immediately and buy a new house and three new cars.  She’s joking, of cou rse.  She’s saying that she will not spend a lot of money because they still don’t  know how the negotiations are going to end up; that is, how they ar e going to come to a final result, what that result will be.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gia:  Why are the negotiations on this deal taking so long?  I thought we would be putting the finishing touches on it by now.

Logan:  The other side is holding out for more concession s.  I don’t know what they’re thinking.  They made some pretty big demands at t he start and I think we’ve given in to most of them.  Now they’re countering  with even more demands.

Gia:  They probably know that they have us over a barrel .  After all of the time and money we’ve put into this deal, they know that we do n’t want to walk away.

 Logan:  That’s true and that’s why we’re still at the table, but they may be pushing too hard.  In the end, I don’t think we’ll cave  on those additional concessions.

Gia:  So the entire thing is touch-and-go right now?

Logan:  That’s how I would characterize it.  If I were  you, I wouldn’t make any long-term plans.

Gia:  Duly noted.  I won’t run out and buy that new h ouse and those three new cars.

I would characterize our scriptwriter as amazing.  That’s because it’s our own Dr. Lucy Tse.
