On this podcast, we’re going to learn about how you  set up or schedule a meeting. Let’s get started! 

[start of dialog] 

I needed to schedule a meeting for the three depart ments involved in a new project. I called each one to find a date that woul d work for all three of us.  

Bruno: So, Nicola, would the day after tomorrow wor k for you?  

Nicola: No, I'll be out of the office all day. Coul d we do it early next week or a week from today? 

Bruno: I was hoping to schedule it as soon as possi ble. How about the end of this week?  

Nicola: Well, I think that's okay. We could meet la te Thursday or Friday. I'm free Thursday from 3 to 5, and on Friday from 10 to 1. 

Bruno: Okay. Let me talk to Kumi and I'll let you k now. . Bruno: Hi Kumi, can you make a meeting with Nicola and me this Thursday or Friday? 

Kumi: Oh, I wish I could but I'll be in the Boise o ffice starting tomorrow. How about the following week?  

Bruno: I think we can do it early next week. Would Monday at 10 work for you? 

Kumi: Sure, that's fine.  

 Bruno: Let me check with Nicola. You know, I think this would be much easier on email. I'll send Nicola a note and we can confirm o n email.  

Kumi: Okay, I'll look for your email. 

You know, sometimes, I think scheduling a meeting i s the hardest part of actually having a meeting!

In this podcast, we hear a dialog about trying to s chedule a meeting. “To schedule” – as a verb – (schedule) – means that you  are trying to find a day and a time when you can do something. We can use this v erb, for example, to schedule a doctor’s appointment, meaning a time and  a day for you to go see the doctor. You can schedule a meeting, you can schedul e just about any event. Well, in this case, they’re scheduling a meeting be tween, or I should say, among three departments or parts of a company. And the di alog begins by the narrator, Bruno, saying, “I called each one” – each of his fe llow employees, other people who work with him – “to find a date that would work  for us.” A “date” (date) is, for example, February 22nd is a date. And a “day” (day)  is the day of the week, so, Wednesday. So, were trying to find a date that will  work for all three of us.  

That expression, “To work for” means that would be good for. So, if someone says to you, “Will Thursday work for you? that mean s is that a good time for you, is that a good day for you. Well, Bruno calls Nicol a on the telephone and says, “Would the day after tomorrow work for you?” “The d ay after tomorrow,” of course, “tomorrow” is the next day, “the day after”  would be two days, so, the day after tomorrow. And Nicola says, “No, I’ll be out o f the office all day.” That expression “out of the office” means you will not b e in your office. You’ll be somewhere else, working – we hope – or maybe sleepi ng. “Could we do it,” Nicola says, “Could we do it early next week or a w eek from today?” “Could we do it” here, “to do it” means could we meet “early next week,” so the following week, early next week, or a week from today. So, if  today is Wednesday, the next Wednesday – seven days from or – 8 days I guess, fr om that day, counting the same day. 

Bruno says, “Well, I was hoping to schedule it as s oon as possible,” meaning immediately, as fast as I can. There’s also another  expression we use, “A.S.A.P.” If you see that abbreviation or acronym “A.S.A.P” t hat is “as soon as possible.” Somebody says, “I’ll need that A.S.A.P. I need it i mmediately.” Bruno says, “How about the end of this week?” Well, the end of this week will usually be Thursday  

or Friday – the end of the week. And of course, the  beginning of the week would be Monday or Tuesday and the middle of the week wou ld be Tuesday, Wednesday, or maybe Thursday. Nicola says that she thinks that’s okay, to meet at the end of the week. “We could meet late Thursda y or Friday,” she says. “Late,” here means later in the day, in the afterno on, 4 o’clock in the afternoon, 5 o’clock – that would be “late in the day.” Well, sh e says she’s free Thursday, from 3 to 5 and Friday from 10 to 1. The expression “I’m  free” (free) means I’m available. I can meet at that time. Someone might s ay, “What time are you free?” “I’m free at 7 P.M.” “I am able to meet you or do s omething at that time.” 

Well, Bruno says, he has to talk to Kumi, one of hi s other fellow employees, other workers at the company. So, he calls Kumi and asks her if she can make a meeting this Thursday or Friday. “To make a meeting ” (make) means to be able to go to a movie . “Can you make a meeting on Frida y” means can you go to, will you be available for a meeting on Friday. And Kumi says that “I wish I could,” meaning I would like to. “I wish I could but I’ll b e in the Boise office starting tomorrow.” “Boise” is a city (Boise) in the state o f Idaho. Well, “starting tomorrow” – that expression means beginning tomorrow. “Starti ng,” for example “Starting on Tuesday, I will not be in the office” means beginni ng Tuesday, or on Tuesday and the following days, I will not be in the office . So, Kumi recommends, “How about the following week?” meaning how about next w eek. So, if you can’t make it today, can you make it next week and if you can’ t make it next week, how about the following week? So, it’s the week after w hatever week you’re talking about. Bruno says, “I think we can do it early next  week and again, “early” would be Monday or Tuesday and he suggests Monday at 10. “Would Monday at 10 work for you?” And Kumi says, “Sure, that’s fine.” Bruno then says, “Let me check with Nicola.” “To check (check) with someone”  means let me talk to them and make sure it’s okay. Let me communicate with th em to see if that is a good time.  

Bruno says, “You know, I think it would be much eas ier on email,” meaning it’ll be much easier for us if we communicate by email or on  email. You can use either “by (by) email,” or “on email.” “I’ll send Nicola a  note and we can confirm on email.” “To confirm” (confirm) means to say yes or no to – “to confirm” means to make sure. For example, we set up a meeting for tom orrow at 7 o’clock and I say, “Well, I will call you this afternoon to confi rm, to make sure that we are still going to be meeting at 7 o’clock. Kumi says, “Okay,  I’ll look for your email.” “I’ll look for” means I’ll be expecting. I will be waitin g for your email. We also use that expression when someone says, “Look for this movie when it comes to your city or your country.” “Look for it” means try to find i t. Be expecting it. Finally, the dialog ends by Bruno saying that “Scheduling a meet ing is the hardest part of actually having a meeting,” and I guess, that’s oft en true.  

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
