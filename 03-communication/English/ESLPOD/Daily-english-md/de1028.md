This episode is called “Describing Order and Sequen ce.” Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Patrick: Okay, your first task is to put all of the se files in order.

Maya: Wow, there must be hundreds of files in this storeroom. How am I supposed to organize them?

Patrick: Create a basic filing system. Put things in sequence. If they’re labeled with dates, put them in chronological order. If the y’re labeled with names, put them in alphabetical order by last name.

Maya: Okay, but what about this file? It’s labeled with a four-digit number, but it’s not a date.

Patrick: Those are case numbers. Put those in ascen ding or descending numeric order, whichever makes sense.

Maya: But this file has letters followed by numbers .

Patrick: Then put those in alphanumeric order, firs t by letter and then by number. Simple, right?

Maya: Yeah, but have you ever considered a more ran dom filing system, something that embraces chaos?

Patrick: No, I haven’t. If I wanted chaos, I’d just  go home to my 11 children!

[end of dialogue]

We begin our dialogue with Patrick saying to Maya, “Okay, your first task is to put all of these files in order.” The word “task” (task ) is very commonly used in the business world to refer to some piece of work that has to be completed – some small job or some small project. Sometimes a projec t has a number of different tasks – a number of different steps or things that have to be done. Patrick is giving Maya a task. He’s telling her to “put all of  these files in order.” “To put something in order” means to move them around so th at they are logically arranged, so that they are organized.

For example, you can put things in alphabetical ord er. That would be starting with “A, B, C, D” in order according to the English alph abet. So, “B” comes before “D,” and “D” comes before “M,” and so forth. There are a ll sorts of ways you can organize something, of course. Patrick is telling M aya to put the files in order. Usually a “file” on a computer is an electronic doc ument. However, in the old days when people used paper, files were things that  you put papers into in order to organize them.

Maya says, “Wow, there must be hundreds of files in  this storeroom.” A “storeroom” (storeroom) is another word for a “ware house” (warehouse). A storeroom, or a warehouse, is basically a large roo m that you keep things in, that you store things in. “To store,” as a verb, means to put aside, to keep in a place until you’re ready to use it. Maya says there are h undreds of files, paper files, in this storeroom. So she asks Patrick, “How am I supp osed to organize them?”

Patrick says, “Create a basic filing system.” A “fi ling system” would be some sort of logical, organized way that you store or keep ei ther your paper or your digital files. “Digital files” are usually kept in folders.  Just like we have paper folders, you also have digital folders, and that’s the word we w ould use in English to describe a place where you would collect a number of differe nt kinds of files that were similar.

A “filing system,” then, is some way of organizing something. For example, for me, when I buy something, especially a piece of com puter equipment or electronic equipment, I make a paper folder or I cr eate a label, a name that I put on the folder, that says “Hardware: ” and then the name of the object, and then I put all of those together in my filing cabinet, whi ch is a place where you keep paper files. That is my, or part of my, filing syst em.

Patrick tells Maya to “put things in sequence.” “Se quence” (sequence) is another word for order – usually it involves putting the ea rliest things before the latest things. Patrick says, “If they are labeled with dat es, put them in chronological order.” “To label” something is to put a name on so mething, to provide basic information about something with what we would call  a “tag” (tag) or a “sticker” (sticker). On a paper file, that would be a little piece of paper that goes on the folder or just words that you write on the folder itself to identify.

“Chronological order” refers to putting things in the earliest to latest sequence – that is, if you are putting things in chronological  order, you would put 2010 before 2011, and 2011 would come before 2012. You would pu t January before March. Patrick says, “If they’re labeled with names, put them in alphabetical order by last name.” “Alphabetical order,” as we explained earlie r, is when you put things in the order of, in this case, the English alphabet: A , B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z. Like that.

Maya says, “Okay, but what about this file? It’s la beled with a four-digit number, but it’s not a date.” A “digit” (digit) is one writ ten number from zero to nine. So, what Maya is saying is that this particular file ha s four numbers. She could just say it’s labeled with “four numbers.” To say it’s l abeled with a “four-digit number” means the same thing. A “digit” is, as I mentioned,  in this case a number from zero to nine.

Patrick says, “Those are case numbers. Put those in  ascending or descending numerical order, whichever makes sense.” “Numeric” (numeric) comes from the word “number.” So, “numeric order” would be putting  things in order of the number that appears on them. “Ascending” (ascending ) means putting the smallest numbers first, before the largest numbers,  or the largest values after the smallest values.

So, if you have four objects – one is labeled “7,” one is labeled “15,” and one is labeled “25” – to put them in “ascending numeric or der” would be to put the 7 before the 15 before the 25. The opposite would be “descending order.” “Descending (descending) order” is when you put the  largest values first, the largest numbers first. So, in our example, it would  be 25, 15, 7. That would be in descending order. “To ascend,” as a verb, means to go up; “to descend” means to go down.

Maya says “But this file has letters followed by nu mbers.” So, the file may be has something like “B-29” or “C748.” Patrick says, “The n put those in alphanumeric order, first, by letter and then by number. “Alphan umeric order” is used when you have both letters and numbers, or words and numbers  together. “Alpha” refers to

alphabetical. “Numeric,” of course, refers to numbe rs. So, “alphanumeric” would be first to put it in alphabetical order, and then you put it in numerical order.

So, for example, if you have “A29” and “A78,” if yo u’re putting them in ascending alphanumeric order you would put “A29” before “A78. ” If you were putting them in descending alphanumeric order, you would put “A78” before A . . . what did I say? 29? Something like that.

Maya says, “Yeah, but have you ever considered a mo re random filing system, something that embraces chaos?” Maya, perhaps, is m aking a joke here. She asks Patrick if he’s ever considered a “random” (ra ndom) filing system. Something that is random is something that is unpre dictable. It is based not on any sort of logic or order, but basically on chance  or luck. Of course, that wouldn’t be any sort of system it all, if it were j ust based on luck or chance.

Maya is suggesting that Patrick have a random filin g system that “embraces chaos.” “Chaos” (chaos) is the opposite of order. I f you looked at my desk right now, for example, and I’m looking at it right now, it is chaos. There is no order. I have papers over here and papers over there. It dri ves my wife crazy – but enough about me.

To finish the dialogue, we will explain what Maya m eans by “embraces.” “To embrace” (embrace) here means to welcome something with a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy, a lot of joy and happiness. Maya is suggesting that Patrick create a file system that would embrace chaos – that would  be based on, if you will, chance.

Patrick says, “No, I haven’t. If I wanted chaos, I’ d go home to my 11 children.” Patrick says that if he wants disorder, he can go h ome to his 11 children. If you have 11 children in one house, you would have a lot  of chaos, a lot of disorder. I know, of course, because I come from a family of 11  children, and there was a lot of chaos when I was growing up.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Patrick: Okay, your first task is to put all of the se files in order.

Maya: Wow, there must be hundreds of files in this storeroom. How am I supposed to organize them?

Patrick: Create a basic filing system. Put things in sequence. If they’re labeled with dates, put them in chronological order. If the y’re labeled with names, put them in alphabetical order by last name.

Maya: But this file has letters followed by numbers .

Patrick: Then put those in alphanumeric order, firs t by letter and then by number. Simple, right?

Maya: Yeah, but have you ever considered a more ran dom filing system, something that embraces chaos?

Patrick: No, I haven’t. If I wanted chaos, I’d just  go home to my 11 children!
