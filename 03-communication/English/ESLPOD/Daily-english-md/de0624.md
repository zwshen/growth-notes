[start of dialogue]

Andy:  Doesn’t it make you sick?  We bust our butts around here and the boss brings in his nephew to be the new manager.

Nia:  You never know.  He may be a good boss.

Andy:  I doubt it.  He’s getting this opportunity just b ecause he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.  He didn’t have to pull himsel f up by his bootstraps like the rest of us.

Nia:  I’m going to wait and see how he is as a manager .  I’m hoping to be pleasantly surprised.

Andy:  If you’re a blue blood like he is, born into pri vilege and old money, you can do no wrong.

Nia:  That’s not true.  He’ll be held accountable for how this department performs.

Andy:  But when does somebody like me get a break?  Okay, I  was born on the wrong side of the tracks.  I grew up in a white trash ne ighborhood.  So what? I’ve worked hard to get where I am now.  That guy hasn’ t paid his dues like I have.

 Nia:  You can complain all you want, but it doesn’t chan ge the situation.  He’s the new boss and we work for him.  Get used to it.

Andy:  Get used to it?!  Not on your life!

Our dialogue begins with Andy saying to Nia, “Doesn’t it  make you sick?”  The expression “to make (someone) sick” in this context means to b ecome very angry, to cause very negative emotions in someone.  When yo u see something that you think is very wrong you would say, “That makes me si ck,” or “It makes me sick to think there are children who need food in th is world and don’t have it.” There are a couple of different meanings, however, usin g the words of this expression; those can be found in our Learning Guide.

Andy says, “We bust our butts around here and the boss bri ngs in his nephew to be the new manager.”  The expression “to bust (bust) you r butt (butt)” means to work very hard, to do a lot of work.  Your “butt” is tha t which you sit on; it’s an informal term that is short for “buttocks.”  “To bust” usu ally means to break, and so basically you’re saying you’re working so hard.  However, t he boss brings in his nephew to be the new manager.  The “nephew” woul d be the son of the boss’ brother or sister.

Nia says, “You never know,” which is a general expression me aning you may be wrong, we don’t know.  “He may be a good boss,” this nep hew.  Andy says, “I doubt it.”  Andy is upset because he thinks that one of t he employees should be promoted to manager – should be made manager because  they have been working very hard in the company.  Andy says, “He (this ne phew) is getting this opportunity because he was born with a silver spoon in hi s mouth.”  This is an old expression; “to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth”  means that you were born into a rich family; you grew up in a family that had a lot of money.  It’s usually used to make some sort of negative comment about a person, how they don’t deserve what they have or how they have not worke d very hard.  Andy says that this nephew of the boss’ didn’t have to pull himse lf up by his bootstraps like the rest of us.  This is another old, but common expression : “to pull yourself up (meaning to lift yourself up) by your bootstraps.”  Your  “bootstraps” are literally little round holes that you use to put on your boots; t hey’re in the back of the boot on the bottom.  But the idea of the expression is that you work very hard to improve your situation in life, you work very hard to get  better even though you don’t have very much money or a lot of things to help you  – you don’t have a lot

 of advantages.  Andy says that everyone else in the company h ad to work hard to get what they have; they had to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

Nia says, “I’m going to wait and see how he is as a man ager.”  She’s saying we should wait and see what happens.  “I’m hoping to be p leasantly surprised.”  “To be surprised” means that you are not expecting certain thi ngs to happen. “Pleasantly” means nicely.  So “to be pleasantly surprised”  is to have something unexpected happen that you like.

Andy says, “If you’re a blue blood like he is, born into p rivilege and old money, you can do no wrong.”  Some more expressions here to tal k about social and economic advantages of some people versus others: “blue blo od” refers to a person who belongs to the richest, most wealthy part of a  society – the most powerful, the most respected.  We would call it the “u pper class.”  “Privilege” (privilege) is another word for advantage, something t hat you have that no one else has.  It’s also, for example, used in talking about t hings that you can do if you are a member of a certain group: “One of the privi leges of being a member of the golf club is that you get to play golf for free.”  Well, you don’t have to pay for each game; you have to pay for your membership.  So, privi lege is another word for advantage.  Again, it is often used to describe socia l or economic advantages. “Old money” refers to money that has been in your family for a long time, wealth that your family has had for many years.  Here in the Un ited States, the Rockefeller family would be perhaps considered a family of  old money – not perhaps, they definitely would be!  The Ford family – F ord Motor Company – money has been in their family for many years, many gen erations: the grandfather, the great-grandfather, and so forth.  S o, old money refers to a rich and powerful family that has been rich for many years.

Andy says if you’re a blue blood like this nephew, and you are born into privilege and old money, meaning when you are born you receive im mediately these advantages, you can do no wrong.  The expression “to do no wrong” means that you are unable to make a mistake.  It also means, more commonly, that when you do make a mistake no one will pay attention; it will  be forgiven or ignored by other people.  Some parents think their children can do  no wrong, so when someone complains to them about their children – for e xample children who are yelling and screaming in the street – when someone compl ains, some parents will say, “Oh, that wasn’t my child, that is impossible.”  Their child can do no wrong.  Well let me tell you, they can!

Moving on: Nia says, “That’s not true.  (The nephew) wil l be held accountable for how this department performs.”  The expression “to hold (someone) accountable”

 means to make someone responsible and accept the results or  consequences of his or her actions.  Basically, it’s another way of saying you  will be punished or rewarded based on what you do.  So if you do a good jo b you’ll be rewarded, but if you do a bad job you will be punished.  Maybe you’ll  lose your job.  That’s to hold someone accountable.

Andy says, “But when does somebody like me get a break?”  “T o get a break” means to get an opportunity to do something, to have som e good luck and to be finally able to do something you want to do.  We often  talk here in Los Angeles about actors and actresses getting a break in the movies or in television; they get the opportunity to work and show how good they are – or  how bad they are! Andy says, “Okay, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks.”   This old expression, again pretty common, “to be born on the wron g side of the tracks” (tracks), means to born in a bad part of the town or cit y where you live.  People who are poor, who don’t have nice houses, where there’ s a lot of crime; this would be the wrong side of the tracks.  “Tracks” here ref ers to the railroad tracks. And railroads, like modern highways and freeways were of ten built in cities and divided the city.  And often on one side of that divide there were people who were poor, and on the other side were people who had more  money.  That’s true here in Los Angeles in some ways.  The major east-west freeway – the 10 freeway, the Santa Monica freeway – does divide the wealthy north  part from the poorer south part, at least in some parts of the city.

So, Andy says he was born on wrong side of the tracks.  “I g rew up,” he says, “in a white trash neighborhood.  So what?”  “White trash ” is an informal and somewhat rude – somewhat not nice phrase to refer typical ly to someone who is white (who is Caucasian), who is poor, has very little e ducation, doesn’t have a good job or does have a job at all.  White trash is a pretty insulting term to refer to someone in that condition.  Andy, however, somewhat u sually describes himself this way, and then he says, “So what?” which is a phrase we use to say that something is not important.  “I don’t have a deg ree from Harvard.  So what?” You’re saying it doesn’t matter; I don’t care.  Andy says t hat he’s worked hard to get where he is now.  “That guy (meaning the nephew) hasn’t paid his dues like I have.”  The expression “to pay your dues” (dues) means to spend a long period of time working in a job that is not very well paid, th at is perhaps not very important.  You do that for a long time so that event ually you will end up with – you will wind up with – you will get a better job at  the end of working so hard at these not so important jobs.  That’s to pay your dues.

Nia says, “You can complain all you want (all you’d like), but it doesn’t change the situation.  He’s the new boss and we work for him.  Get used to it.”  “To get

 used to” (used to – two words) means to become accustomed to something, to see something as normal, as common, as ordinary.  I’m tryin g to get used to the silence outside where I am recording, because school has s tarted and all the lovely children are back in school.  That’s a wonderful thi ng!  Here in the United States, we have what is called “compulsory schooling,” you must go to school between the ages of 6 and 16 approximately.  It’s a won derful thing for me!

Andy says, “Get used to it?!  Not on your life!”  This is a  common expression; informally we say “not on your life” to mean that somet hing is impossible, something will never happened under any circumstances.  “ Are you going to go to John’s party?”  You say, “Not on your life,” meaning absolutely not, that will never happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
