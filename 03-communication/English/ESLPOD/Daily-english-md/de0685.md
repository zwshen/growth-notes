This episode is called “Getting Feedback on Writing ,” getting someone’s reaction to, comments on, and corrections on your writing.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Xica:  I just got my paper back from Professor Rodr iguez and it’s all marked up. 

Lucas:  Let me see.  It doesn’t look too bad.  This  is a draft, right?  His note at the top says to make revisions before handing in a fina l version.  He’s trying to help you get a better grade. 

Xica:  Maybe, but there’s nothing he likes about th e essay.  Look at all of those comments in the margins.  He underlined the entire introduction and wrote “run- on sentence” next to it. 

Lucas:  That’s easy to fix, and it is a run-on sent ence, you know. 

Xica:  And in the body, he wrote that I had no tran sitions and that my arguments weren’t well supported. 

Lucas:  Well, transitions are easy to put in and yo u just need to cite a few more sources – that’s all. 

Xica:  Yeah, but that’s not all.  Next to the concl usion, he wrote that I didn’t properly summarize my main points.  See what I mean ?  There’s nothing he likes about this essay. 

Lucas:  I think you should take the constructive cr iticism as it’s meant – to help you.  

 Xica:  It’s easy for you to say.  You’re done with college.  It’s kind of demoralizing to get your paper back all marked up. 

Lucas:  True, but you forget that I have my own bat tle wounds – lots of them!

Our dialogue begins with Xica saying to Lucas, “I j ust got my paper back from Professor Rodriguez and it’s all marked up.”  A “pa per,” in this case, is something you would give to a teacher or professor in school,  some writing that you had to do, maybe an essay.  Xica has received her paper ba ck from Professor Rodriguez.  She gave it to Professor Rodriguez and Rodriguez gave it back to her all marked up.  “To be marked up” means that it  has been corrected, edited, perhaps changed.  Usually the teacher or professor will use a red pen, and they will circle things and write things there, and indi cate how it needs be corrected or changed. 

Lucas says, “Let me see.  It doesn’t look too bad.  This is a draft, right?”  A “draft” is the first attempt or one of your first attempts to write a certain paper or document.  Usually, the draft has be changed, corre cted, and reviewed.  So, when someone says, “This paper is just a draft,” th ey mean it still isn’t perfect yet.  Lucas says that his, meaning Professor Rodrig uez, note at the top of the paper says to make revisions before handing in a fi nal version.  “Revisions” are changes to what you have written, changes to the pa per or document to make it better.  “To hand in” means to give to, in this cas e, the professor.  “Hand in” is the phrasal verb we often use in school to talk about t hings that you are giving to the professor or the teacher as a student, but it also could be used in other circumstances.   

Lucas says, “He (the professor) is trying to help y ou get a better grade (a better mark on your paper).”  Xica says, “Maybe, but there ’s nothing he likes about the essay.  Look at all of those comments in the margin s.”  “Comments” are, in this case, someone’s opinion about something or addition al information that they want you to think about and perhaps use in making y our revisions.  There are other meanings of the word “comment,” and those can  be found in our Learning Guide.  A “margin” (margin), when talking about a p iece of paper, is the space at the top, bottom, right or left sides of the page; t hey are often white, but not always.  The margin is where you could write commen ts on someone’s writing. It’s space that is not usually written in.  “Margin ” has a couple of different meanings in English and those, once again, can be f ound in our wonderful Learning Guide.  Xica says that the professor under lined the entire introduction  

and wrote (quote) “run-on sentence” (unquote) next to it.  “To underline” is to draw a thin, small line below the text, underneath the writing, often to emphasize or point out something.  The “introduction” is the first part of the paper; in this case it was an essay.  The introduction usually tel ls you what the essay is going to be about.  Xica says that the professor underlin ed the entire introduction and wrote “run-on sentence.”  A “run-on sentence” is a sentence that is very long, often one the uses the word “and,” “or,” or another  conjunction too many times so the sentence keeps going and going and going.  Usua lly, a run-on sentence is one where you can put a period in; you can break th e sentence up and it will make more sense or read more easily.  A run-on sent ence, in other words, is not something you want to have, and that’s what the pro fessor is telling poor Xica. 

Lucas says, “That’s easy to fix (that’s easy to cor rect), and it is a run-on sentence, you know.”  He’s agreeing with the profes sor that Xica’s first sentence or the introduction is a run-on sentence.  Xica the n says, “And in the body, he wrote that I had no transitions and that my argumen ts weren’t well supported.” The “body,” when we’re talking about an essay, a do cument like this, is the main part of the essay; it’s the main part of the docume nt.  You have an introduction, a body, and a conclusion.  So it’s the longest, typic ally, part of the essay, where you present the main points you are making and any evidence to support those points.  Xica says that in the body of her essay th e professor wrote that she had no transitions.  A “transition” in writing is a wor d or short phrase that we use between sentences or between paragraphs that make t he writing smoother; they help you go from one point to the next point.  So, phrases like “in addition” and “nevertheless” and “however,” these could all be tr ansitional words or phrases. Xica says that the professor told her she had no tr ansitions and that her arguments weren’t well supported.  “Well supported”  means that you have a lot of evidence or proof for what you are saying.  You are  able to give facts that show that your conclusion is true. 

Lucas says, “Well, transitions are easy to put in.”   It’s not difficult to put in the words and phrases so that the essay flows more smoo thly; you have phrases that take you from one part to the next.  He says, “you just need to cite a few more sources.”  In order for the essay to be well s upported is what he means. “To cite” (cite) means to refer to typically anothe r written document, maybe something in a book or a magazine that was said in order to support your own arguments.  It could be something that another expe rt said; it could be information that supports what you are trying to ar gue for.  So, Lucas says that in order to have a well supported argument, Xica just needs to put in – just needs to write in, to cite a few more sources.  “Source,” he re, is the book, the article, the interview where that particular piece of informatio n comes from. 

Xica says, “Yeah, but that’s not all.  Next to the conclusion, he wrote that I didn’t properly summarize my main points.”  The “conclusio n” is the last, final part of an essay.  Remember, we have the introduction, the bod y, and now the conclusion. The conclusion of an essay usually summarizes your main points.  “To summarize” means to state the main ideas in a short  form, very quickly using just a couple of sentences.  Xica says, “See what I mean ?  There’s nothing he likes about this essay.”  So, the professor didn’t like t he introduction, he didn’t like the body, and he didn’t like the conclusion. 

Lucas says, “I think you should take the constructi ve criticism as it’s meant – to help you.”  “Constructive criticism” is advice that  is meant to help someone improve something by showing them what is wrong wit h what they’re doing now. It’s “constructive” because you give it to the pers on in order to help them be better.  Of course, when you are “criticizing” some one, when you are telling them what they are doing wrong, they don’t always consid er that advice to be constructive, to be given to you in order to help y ou.  But, Lucas says that’s what Xica needs to do, that’s what the criticism is mean t to do, that’s the purpose of it. 

So, Xica says, “It’s easy for you to say.”  That ex pression means that it’s easy for another person to tell you what to do because they don’t have to do it themselves.  Xica says, “You’re done with college ( meaning you’re finished with college, you are no longer in college – at the univ ersity).  It’s kind of demoralizing to get your paper back all marked up.”  “Demoralizi ng” is something that is depressing, something that is frustrating, somethin g that makes you feel like you’re not very good and will never be very good at  this action – this activity, in Xica’s case writing an essay.  She found the profes sor’s comments demoralizing. 

Lucas says, “True (it can be demoralizing), but you  forget that I have my own battle wounds – lots of them!”  A “battle” is when two groups of people are fighting each other, perhaps two different countrie s.  A “wound” (wound) is when you are hurt; perhaps you have been shot or you hav e been cut.  A “battle wound,” then, is some injury that you have received  in a battle.  Lucas is using the expression here to mean that he has also receiv ed a lot of criticism.  He received difficult comments from professors when he  was in school so that he also knows what it is like to get these kinds of co mments, and that Xica’s experience is not unique.  She’s not the only one, he also has gone through this experience. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
