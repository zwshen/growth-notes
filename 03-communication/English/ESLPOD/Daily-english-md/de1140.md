This episode is called “Dealing With” (or handling, taking care of) “a Lan guage Barrier” – when two people can’t understand each other. Let’s get start ed.  

[start of dialogue] 

Carol: Send another memo to the Gibberese office. I  think we have our wires crossed again. 

Art: Don’t you think it would be better to call the  office and speak to someone there? You might be able to get to the bottom of th e misunderstanding more quickly. 

Carol: I don’t speak Gibberish and we don’t have an yone bilingual in the office to act as an interpreter.  

Art: Which means there’s no one who could translate  our correspondence into Gibberish to make things easier.  

Carol: That’s right. And plus, leaving a paper trai l is better. 

Art: You mean in case we have to cover our asses. 

Carol: I wouldn’t put it like that, but breakdowns in communication are inevitable and it’s always helpful to be able to trace their s ource. 

Art: Right. Okay, I’ll draft a memo and pass it by you before I send it, okay? 

Carol: Sounds good.  

Art: What I don’t understand is why we don’t simply  hire people for this office who are fluent in Gibberish. 

Carol: Do you know anyone who speaks Gibberish? 

Art: Plenty!

This episode is entitled “Dealing With a Language B arrier.” “To deal (deal) with” something means to take care of something or to han dle a situation that might be difficult. This dialogue is about dealing with a “l anguage barrier” (barrier). A “barrier” is normally something that separates two people or two groups of people. A barrier might also separate two different  substances that you don’t want to mix together. A “language barrier” usually refers to when two people speak different languages and can’t communicate wit h each other.  

Carol begins by saying, “Send another memo to the G ibberese office. I think we have our wires crossed.” A “memo” (memo) is a short  business document, usually just one or two pages, that has information  about a specific topic. Usually a memo is sent to people in your organization or wi thin your company. “Memo” is actually short for a longer word, “memorandum.”  

Carol says, “Send another memo to the Gibberese off ice.” We’re guessing that the “Gibberese office” is another office, perhaps i n a different country. Carol says, “I think we have our wires crossed again.” Th e expression “to have your wires (wires) crossed” means to have a misunderstan ding – when two people or two groups of people don’t understand each other be cause one person didn’t communicate the message very clearly or the other p erson misinterpreted or misunderstood the message.  

Art says, “Don’t you think it would be better to ca ll the office and speak to someone there?” Art doesn’t think it’s a good idea just to send a memo, which is – well, in the old days – a piece of paper, but now adays more typically a Word document or a PDF document, I suppose. Art says, “Y ou might be able to get to the bottom of the misunderstanding more quickly.”  

The expression “to get to the bottom (bottom) of” s omething is a very common one in English. It means to investigate and find th e real reason for something or to understand the cause of something. Often we use this expression when we’re trying to understand the reason for a problem or th e cause of some problem. When there is a disaster that the government is inv olved in, sometimes officials  

for the government will say, “We’re going to get to  the bottom of this” – we’re going to really find out what caused this. Of cours e, they never do, but that’s what they say.  

Art says that if Carol calls the Gibberese office t hat they might be able to get to the bottom of the misunderstanding more quickly. A “misunderstanding” as a noun means a confusion, something that wasn’t under stood correctly. Carol says, “I don’t speak Gibberish and we don’t have an yone bilingual in the office to act as an interpreter.” “Gibberish” here is used as  a real language, but it’s really a joke in the dialogue because the word “gibberish” ( gibberish) means meaningless words – words that you can’t understand, that don’t  have any meaning.  

When people don’t have an answer for something or t hey want to confuse you, they might start using real words, but in such a wa y that the words don’t really convey any meaning – they don’t communicate any mes sage. They are using these words just to confuse you. Carol says, “I don ’t speak Gibberish,” which here is a real language, “and we don’t have anyone bilingual in the office.” “To be bilingual” (bilingual) means to be able to speak tw o languages.  

There’s an old joke: What do you call someone who c an speak three languages? The answer is “trilingual.” What do you call someon e who can speak two languages? The answer is “bilingual.” What do you c all someone who can speak only one language? The answer is “an American.” Wel l, the actual answer would be someone who is “monolingual” (monolingual). But back to our dialogue . . .  

Carol says that she doesn’t have anyone in the offi ce “to act as,” or to be, “an interpreter” (interpreter). An “interpreter” is som eone who translates spoken language. “To translate” means to take the meaning of the words in one language, of course, and put them in another langua ge. A “translator” (translator) is a person who does that translation in writing. A n interpreter is someone who translates spoken language.  

It’s a difference that is not always observed – tha t people speaking and writing in English don’t always follow – but technically, an i nterpreter is someone who translates spoken language. A translator is someone  who translates written language. Art says, “Which means there is no one wh o could translate our correspondence into Gibberish to make things easier .” Here, Art uses the verb “to translate” to mean to take the words in one lan guage in written form and put them in another language.  

Carol says, “That’s right,” meaning that’s correct.  “And plus,” she says, “leaving a paper trail is better.” A “paper trail” (trail) is when you have written documents  

that you can show someone to prove what happened or  to demonstrate what happened. A paper trail is very useful if you think  you may be, in the future, investigated or if you need to show what happened i n a certain business transaction or business deal. A paper trail usually  would include keeping paper documents or electronic documents – emails, for exa mple – that show what happened during a certain situation.  

For example, if someone hits your car and you need to contact your insurance company, you are going to want to have a paper trai l of all the things the insurance company sends you, all the things the oth er driver sends you. You need to keep all of that in case there’s a problem in the future. Carol says, “A paper trail is better than just calling someone on the telephone.” Art says, “You mean in case we have to cover our asses?” “To cover  (cover) your ass” means to protect yourself from blame, to protect yourself fr om future accusations that you did something wrong.  

This expression is not one that you would want to u se unless you knew the person fairly well. It’s an informal and vulgar exp ression – I wouldn’t normally use this expression, myself. I don’t like using bad wor ds in English, but this is an expression that in fact you would probably hear in an office among people who knew each other well. A lot of people use an abbrev iation instead of the actual expression which is “CYA,” which means “Cover Your A” – and then of course the rest of the word. It’s not an expression I woul d recommend you using. We include it here so you can understand what it actua lly means.  

Continuing on, then, Carol says, “I wouldn’t put it  like that,” meaning I wouldn’t express it like that, “but breakdowns in communicat ion are inevitable and it’s always helpful to be able to trace their source.” A  “breakdown (breakdown) in communication” is when two people or two groups of people misunderstand each other – when the message that one group is trying t o communicate to the other is not understood correctly.  

Something that is “inevitable” (inevitable) is some thing that you cannot avoid, something that will happen even if you don’t want i t to happen or even if you try to prevent it from happening. Death is inevitable. You are all going to die, just like I am. It’s something you can’t avoid. There. Isn’t that a happy thought? Don’t you feel better now? You’re going to die.  

Anyway, Carol says, “It’s always helpful to be able  to trace (trace) their source.” “To trace” means to follow the path or development of something. In this case, really it means to identify the source, to find out  where the breakdown in communication took place. That’s why Carol thinks i t’s better to leave a paper  

trail. You can see when there is a miscommunication , where that happened. If you just talk to someone on the telephone, unless y ou are recording the conversation, you can’t figure out where the proble m was, perhaps.  

Art says, “Right. Okay, I’ll draft a memo and pass it by you before I send it, okay?” “To draft” (draft) something is to write the  first version of something, especially something you plan on changing or revisi ng in the future. Art is going to draft a memo and “pass it by” Carol. “To pass so mething by” someone means to give it to someone so that that person can look at it and perhaps approve it – say it’s okay – or revise it, change it so that it’ s better.  

Carol says, “Sounds good,” which is an informal way  of saying yes, okay, that’s a good idea: “Sounds good.” Art says, “What I don’t u nderstand is why we don’t simply hire people for this office who are fluent i n Gibberish.” “To be fluent” (fluent) in a language means to be able to speak th e language easily and smoothly like a native speaker, like someone who gr ew up speaking the language. Carol says, “Do you know anyone who speak s Gibberish?” Art responds, “Plenty” (plenty). “Plenty” means a lot o r many – more than what we need.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.  

[start of dialogue] 

Carol: Send another memo to the Gibberese office. I  think we have our wires crossed again. 

Art: Don’t you think it would be better to call the  office and speak to someone there? You might be able to get to the bottom of th e misunderstanding more quickly.
