This episode is about mental disorders – problems t hat people have psychologically, mentally. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Dr. Miao: At Berthiaume College, we take mental hea lth issues very seriously. That’s why we have so many mental health services o n campus. 

Dean: Such as? 

Dr. Miao: Well, for example, there is a meeting ton ight of our support group for anorexics and bulimics. Tomorrow night, I’ll be spe aking to a group of students about depression to make them aware of the warning signs. 

Dean: Those are very important issues.  

Dr. Miao: Yes, they are. In this student health cen ter, we see cases ranging from social anxiety disorder to schizophrenia. In additi on to serious mental disorders, college students are at risk of developing many typ es of antisocial behaviors resulting from the pressures of college and the str ess of being on their own. 

Dean: I know what you mean. One of my roommates cop es with stress by binge drinking. My other roommate has become obsessive-co mpulsive. You should see how clean our apartment is. 

Dr. Miao: And you? How have you been dealing with t he stress? 

Dean: Me? I think I’m the only well-adjusted one in  the group. 

Dr. Miao: Are you sure? You seem to have developed a nervous habit of pulling your hairs out one at a time. 

Dean: What?! No, I haven’t. 

Dr. Miao: Denying you have a problem is often a sig n that you have a problem. 

Dean: That’s crazy! 

Dr. Miao: Shh! We don’t use the c-word here. Come w ith me. 

[end of dialogue] 

Dr. Miao opens our dialogue by saying, “At Berthiau me College, we take mental health issues very seriously. “Mental health issues ” refers to problems that someone may have due to psychological or emotional issues, things that perhaps relate to how well they react to stress or to difficult situations. “Mental health” is a general term referring to one’s psycho logical and emotional wellness or well-being. Dr. Miao works at a college, “Berthi aume College.” She says, “that’s why we have so many mental health services on campus.” Dr. Miao is talking to a student named Dean.  

Dean wants to know what kind of mental health issue s Dr. Miao is talking about. Dr. Miao says, “Well, for example, there is a meeti ng tonight of our support group for anorexics and bulimics.” A “support group” is a  group of people who get together who all have the same problem, either a ph ysical or a mental problem. One of the most famous support group structures in the U.S. and around the world is “Alcoholics Anonymous.” Alcoholics Anonymo us is a group of people who get together in their community or their neighb orhood to help each other with their problem of alcoholism.  

This is a “support group for anorexics and bulimics ,” however. “Anorexic” (anorexic) is an adjective used to describe a perso n who suffers from something called “anorexia nervosa,” which is a mental illnes s that causes you to eat very little and to exercise a lot in order to lose weigh t, but you do it to an extreme extent so that you become too thin, and in some cas es, tragically, you may even die from this disorder. A “bulimic” (bulimic) is a person who suffers from  

something called “bulimia,” which is when you eat a  lot of food and then you basically vomit it up – you throw it up – in order to maintain or lose weight. 

“Tomorrow night,” Dr. Miao continues, “I’ll be spea king to a group of students about depression to make them aware of the warning signs.” “Depression” (depression) is a long period of feeling sad, often  associated with lack of energy and lack of motivation. A “lack (lack) of” somethin g means you don’t have any. So, you don’t have any energy or you don’t have any  motivation – or at least, not enough to do what you need to get done.  

Dr. Miao is going to talk to this group of students  about the warning signs of depression. A “warning sign” is an indication that there is a problem. So, if you start gaining weight suddenly, and within a month o r two, you’re 10 or 20 pounds heavier than you should be, that might be a warning  sign that there’s something wrong with either the way you are eating or perhaps  some problem that you are having in your body – some physical issue.  

Dean says, “Those are very important issues” (the i ssues that Dr. Miao just mentioned). Dr. Miao continues. She says, “Yes, the y are. In this student health center we see cases ranging from social anxiety dis order to schizophrenia.” “Social anxiety disorder” is a condition that cause s you to fear being around other people because you are perhaps afraid of being emba rrassed or of not being as good as the people around you.  

“Schizophrenia” (schizophrenia) is also a mental di sorder. This one is related to making it difficult or impossible for you to know w hat is real and what is imaginary. People with schizophrenia often react to  other people and situations in strange ways because they’re imagining things that aren’t actually real. Dr. Miao is talking about the student health center at the c ollege. A “student health center” would be a place where students go to get medical a ttention, to get medical help. This kind of medical help has to do with mental hea lth.  

Dr. Miao continues, “In addition to serious mental disorders, college students are at risk of developing many types of antisocial beha viors resulting from the pressures of college and the stress of being on the ir own.” Now, let’s break that down and talk about what that sentence means. Dr. M iao is saying that “college students are at risk of developing” certain behavio rs. “To be at risk of” something means that you might be in danger of getting that t hing. There is a possibility that something bad will happen to you.  

The bad thing that will happen to college students is that they will develop “antisocial behaviors.” “Antisocial (antisocial) be havior” is a way of acting that  

doesn’t show consideration of the people around you . It’s a way of acting that may make you mean to or hurt other people around yo u. The word “antisocial” is also used to describe people who don’t like being a round other people. I think I’m antisocial, actually. Anyway, Dr. Miao says that co llege students are at risk of developing these types of antisocial behaviors.  

Dean says, “I know what you mean,” meaning I unders tand what you are saying. “One of my roommates copes with stress by binge dri nking.” A “roommate” is someone that shares a room or an apartment with you . “To cope (cope) with” something means to be able to handle or deal with a  difficult and challenging situation. We use this expression – this phrasal ve rb “to cope with” something – when we are talking about someone who has to deal w ith a difficult situation. “Binge (binge) drinking” is when you drink a lot of  alcohol in a very short amount of time.  

“My other roommate,” Dean continues, “has become ob sessive-compulsive.” “To be obsessive (obsessive) – compulsive (compulsive)”  is to be concerned often about very small things. When you are obsessive abo ut something, you’re constantly thinking about it. Normally, when we tal k about someone being obsessive-compulsive, we’re talking about someone w ho perhaps repeats certain behaviors over and over again. They may wash their hands a hundred times in order to make sure they are clean. That would perha ps be an example of an obsessive-compulsive behavior.  

Dean says that his roommate has become obsessive-co mpulsive. He says, “You should see how clean our apartment is.” That expres sion “you should see” means this is a very good example – I am giving you  a good example, and if you actually went to my apartment and saw it, you would  understand what I’m talking about. We’ll often use that expression “you should see” when we are giving an example similar to what the other person said, and perhaps even a better case of whatever the phenomenon you’re talking about is tha n the person gave you.  

So, someone may say, “Well, my brother is really la zy,” and you may say to that person, “Well, you should see my brother – he doesn ’t even get up in the morning.” You’re giving that person an example of t hat situation or that phenomenon that is perhaps even a better example of  what you are talking about than what the other person gave. So, Dr. Miao is gi ving examples of conditions, mental disorders, and Dean is saying he understands  what Dr. Miao is talking about and then gives her some examples from his own  personal experience.  

Dr. Miao then asks Dean, “And you? How have you bee n dealing with the stress?” Dean says, “Me? I think I’m the only well- adjusted one in the group.” “To  

be well-adjusted” is to be normal – to be adapted t o some situation and to behave in a way that is appropriate and acceptable.  Dr. Miao says, “Are you sure? You seem to have developed a nervous habit of  pulling your hairs out one at a time.” Dr. Miao is saying that Dean has a nerv ous habit. A “habit” is something you do over and over again.  

You may have a habit of brushing your teeth every m orning. That’s a good habit. A “nervous habit” is something you do, perhaps even  without realizing it, because you are nervous – because you are, perhaps, under s tress. I have a nervous habit. I tap my feet. I take my foot and I pound it  against the ground. My wife absolutely hates my nervous habit. She’s always tel ling me to stop tapping my feet. “To tap” (tap) is to move your foot up and do wn so that it hits the floor or the ground.  

Anyway, enough about my mental problems – back to o ur dialogue. Dr. Miao is telling Dean that he has this nervous habit of pull ing out his hairs one at a time – taking the hair, I’m guessing (I’m hoping) on his h ead and pulling it out. Dean says, “What?! No, I haven’t,” meaning he has not de veloped this nervous habit. Dr. Miao says, “Denying you have a problem is often  a sign that you have a problem.” “To deny” (deny) something is to say that  something is not true, to say that it doesn’t exist.  

Dr. Miao is saying that Dean is denying that he has  a problem, and that when you say you don’t have a problem, this is a sign th at you have a problem. This is something that psychologists like to say and that h as sort of entered into the general public view of mental disorders or problems : people who deny they have a problem have a problem.  

Of course, the other possibility is that a person w ho denies he has a problem doesn’t have a problem, but we live in a world now affected by psychological theory, and this is one that at least is popular am ong a lot of people – that denying the problem means perhaps that you actually  have that problem. And I’m sure that happens, as well.  

Dean says, “That’s crazy.” Dr. Miao says, “Shh! We don’t use the c-word here. Come with me.” Dean is reacting to Dr. Miao’s state ment, saying that she’s crazy, she’s out of her head, she’s nuts. “Crazy” i s a very negative way to describe someone who may have a mental disorder.  

So, Dr. Miao says, “We don’t use the c-word here.” The “c-word” here means crazy. When there’s a word or a term that you don’t  want to say out loud, you can use an expression or a phrase like this by just usi ng the first letter of the word.  

 It’s usually a word that is a bad word or that you don’t want to talk about or say out loud, perhaps because it is rude or unacceptabl e.  

So, someone might say, “I got in trouble by saying the f-word in school.” The “f- word” refers to a word that begins with “F” and in this case is considered a very bad word to say in English. It’s a four-letter word  that ends with “K.” You probably have heard it. So, that phrase has become popular n ow when people want to mention a word without actually saying the word, an d that’s what Dr. Miao is doing here. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
