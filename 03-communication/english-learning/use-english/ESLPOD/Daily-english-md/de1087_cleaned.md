[start of dialogue] 

[doorbell rings] 

Otto: Hi, I’m Otto from Windows-R-Us. I’m here to s how you the window treatment options we offer and to take measurements  for installation if you decide to order from our store. 

Jean: Hi, Otto. I’m Jean. Come on in. I want to get  some new window treatments for the living room. Can you show me what you have?  

Otto: Sure. For the living room, I would recommend these beautiful wooden shutters. Opening the slats allows light to filter in and closing them blocks light and gives you privacy. 

Jean: They’re nice, but I think they may be a littl e too expensive for me. 

Otto: In that case, you might like blinds, mini bli nds, or vertical blinds. They have the same function as shutters at a fraction of the price. 

Jean: Those are still a little bit pricey. Are ther e any other options? 

Otto: Well, you could go with curtains. You can cho ose the type of curtain rods that match your décor and any kind of fabric. With a valance, they would look very nice. 

Jean: Nice fabric could cost a lot of money. Any ot her suggestions? 

Otto: Do you have a bedsheet? 

Jean: Yes. 

Otto: Nail it over your window and call it a day. H ave a nice day, ma’am.

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Otto saying, “Hi, I’m Otto  from Windows-R-Us.” “Windows-R-Us” is, I guess, the name of the company , a company that probably sells windows or things related to windows – and th at’s exactly what Otto is going to talk about here. He says, “I’m here to show you the window treatment options we offer.” “Window treatments” are the kinds of thi ngs that you cover a window with, either because you don’t want people to see i nside of your house or for decoration, because it looks nice.  

Otto says that he’s there talking to Jean to show h er the window treatment options that his company offers, that his company s ells. He’s also there at her house “to take measurements for installation” if Je an decides to order from his store. “Measurements” (measurements) are numbers sh owing the height, the width, and sometimes the depth of something. Measur ements refer to how big something is. “It’s 10 inches by 20 inches.” That w ould be a measurement, say, of a window – a really, really, really small window . “Installation” (installation) is the act of putting something in place, of setting s omething up, of in this case putting something on the windows.  

Jean says, “Hi, Otto. I’m Jean. Come on in,” meanin g come into the house. Our dialogue began with the doorbell ringing, so we kno w that Otto was outside of the house, and Jean opens the door for him and lets him  in. Jean then says, “I want to get some new window treatments for the living ro om. Can you show me what you have?” Otto says, “Sure. For the living room, I  would recommend these beautiful wooden shutters.” “Shutters” (shutters) a re a kind of window treatment that is fixed onto the frame of the window, typical ly, and usually made of wood.  

You can have shutters that are vertical – that run from top to bottom – that you open up just like a door in front of your window. Y ou can also have shutters that are horizontal – that go from side to side – that a re again permanently attached or affixed to the frame of the window. The “frame” (frame) is the part inside of the house that holds the windows in place. Typically wi ndows, of course, are made of glass that you can see through.  

If the shutters are horizontal, usually they are ma de of long, flat pieces of wood or some other material that are placed one below th e other so that you have a set of these long, narrow pieces of wood. These lon g, narrow pieces are called “slats” (slats). The slats then are opened or close d, usually with a long stick or long piece of wood that is attached to all of the s lats so you can open the slats to let light in or close them to keep light out. That’ s why Otto says, “Opening the slats allows light to filter in.” “To filter (filte r) in” means to come in, but not completely.  

If you have shutters on your windows, not all of th e light will come into the room, only the amount of light that can come in when the slats are open. Closing the slats “blocks light.” “To block” (block) means to s top or prevent something from going from one place to another. In this case, it b locks the light from coming into the room when you have the shutters closed. This al so gives you “privacy” – it means that people can’t see into your house.  

Jean says, “They’re nice, but I think they may be a  little expensive for me.” Otto says, “In that case, you might like blinds, mini bl inds, or vertical blinds.” “Blinds” (blinds) are similar to shutters, but usually they’ re made of metal or plastic and are attached together not with a piece of wood – us ually with a string or cord. Blinds are also not fixed permanently to the frame of the window, so that you can usually roll the blinds up, meaning you can remove the window treatment – the blinds – so that it’s at the very top or bottom or side of the window.  

With shutters, the slats are usually permanent. You  can’t move them up or down completely. You can only open and close them. With blinds, you’re able to not only open and close the slats to let light in or to  block light from coming in, but to move the blinds to the top or to the bottom, typica lly. Now, if you have blinds where the slats are horizontal, we usually call tho se “venetian blinds,” like the city of Venice in Italy.  

You can also have what are called “vertical blinds. ” Those are blinds, often used for large windows or doors, that go from top to bot tom instead of from side to side, and like horizontal or venetian blinds, you c an also open and close the slats or push them to expose the entire window or door. “ Mini blinds” are the same as  

blinds, except the slats are smaller and usually na rrower than you would see in regular blinds.  

Otto tells Jean that the blinds have the same funct ion – that is, they do the same things – as shutters at a fraction of the price. “A t a fraction (fraction) of the price” means at a much lower price, much less expensive. B ut Jean says, “Those are still a bit pricey.” If you describe something as “ pricey” (pricey), you mean it is expensive. It costs more than what you want to pay,  perhaps. Jean says, “Are there any other options?”  

Otto says, ‘Well, you could go with curtains.” “Cur tains” (curtains) are large pieces of fabric, large pieces of cloth that are hu ng from the top of the window and extend all the way to the bottom of the window,  typically. Sometimes there will be two sets of curtains, one on the top of the  window and one on the bottom of the window. Sometimes there’ll be one long curta in that covers the entire window. Usually curtains can be opened or closed, j ust like blinds.  

Otto says, “You can choose the type of curtain rods  that match your décor and any kind of fabric.” A “curtain rod” (rod) is a lon g pole or stick that goes at the top of the window on which you hang the curtain. The cu rtain rods can match your décor. “Décor” (décor) means the look of a room, th e way it is decorated, the way it is furnished. The style, the color, the type of material in the room are all part of the décor of a room.  

Otto says the curtains can be made of any “fabric” (fabric). “Fabric” is the same as cloth – large pieces of material, in this case t hat are used to make curtains. You can also make clothing out of fabric. Otto says , “With a valance, they would look very nice.” A “valance” (valance) is a short p iece of fabric that is put over the top part of the window to hide the curtain rod so y ou don’t actually see it.  

Jean says, “Nice fabric could cost a lot of money. Any other suggestions?” Jean doesn’t seem to want to pay very much for her windo w treatments, so Otto – I think making a joke – says, “Do you have a bedsheet ?” A “bedsheet” is a large piece of fabric that you put on top of your bed. Je an says, “Yes.” Otto says, “Nail it over your window and call it a day.” A “nail” (n ail) is a short round piece of metal that you use in combination with a hammer in order to put two things together. The verb is “to nail.”  

Otto is jokingly suggesting to Jean that she just t ake an old bedsheet and put it over the window and “call it a day.” The expression  “to call it a day” means to stop working on something for the rest of the day, especially if you are very tired  

of working on it. Even if you haven’t finished, you  will stop working on it. That’s the meaning of “to call it a day.” Otto is joking, but he’s also angry. He says, “Have  a nice day, ma’am.” And then he closes the door very loudly. Of course, he’s fru strated with Jean because Jean seems to think that all of these options are t oo expensive.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
