This episode is a dialogue between Marta and Bruno about giving commands as you would in the military. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Marta: What’s going on out here? What’s all that no ise?

Bruno: I’m putting the troops through their drills.

Marta: Troops?!

Bruno: Watch this. Hey, I didn’t tell you you could  be at ease. Attention! Fall in. Forward, march!

Marta: That’s great, but . . .

Bruno: I’m not done. Let me show you what else thes e troops can do. Halt! About face!

Marta: Don’t you think that it’s time to . . .?

Bruno: March, march! Double time!

Child: Wah! [Child crying loudly.]

Marta: Come here. Did you fall down and hurt yourse lf? It’s okay. Everything’s going to be okay.

Bruno: Hey, there’s no crying in the military. Don’ t coddle the troops, Marta.

Marta: Bruno, your twins are five years old. Don’t you think they’re a little too young to be going to boot camp?

Bruno: No, it’s never too young to instill discipli ne. Okay troops, fall in. Mark time! Now march, march, march . . .

[end of dialogue]

Marta begins our dialogue by saying to Bruno, “What ’s going on out here?” “What’s going on” means what’s happening. “Out here ” usually would be used when we are talking about something outside of a bu ilding or outside of a house. Marta asks, “What’s all that noise?” Bruno says, “I ’m putting the troops through their drills.” “Troops” (troops) are soldiers – an organized group of soldiers or organized groups of soldiers. “Drills” (drills) are  exercises, things that you do over and over again to prepare you for something.

We might talk about drills, for example, in school when math teachers are trying to teach their students how to multiply numbers. Th ey may give them exercises, and we may call those exercises “drills.” Bruno say s that he’s “putting the troops through their drills,” meaning he’s making these so ldiers do these exercises – and usually when we talk about military drills, we’ re talking about physical activity, physical exercises.

Marta is very surprised by what Bruno is saying. Sh e says, “Troops?” She’s asking a question, but is also clearly shocked, cle arly surprised. Bruno says, “Watch this,” meaning pay attention and look at thi s. “Hey, I didn’t tell you you could be at ease. Attention! Fall in. Forward, marc h!” Bruno uses some common military terms here. He’s talking to Marta and tell ing Marta to watch what he is doing with his troops.

He then says to one of the (what we believe are) so ldiers, “at ease.” “At ease” (ease) means to be relaxed, to be in a comfortable position. In the military, “at ease” is a command telling you that you don’t have to stand at attention. “To stand at attention” is to usually stand up straight  and be very still, whereas “at ease” often is a position that you would take by pu tting your legs, say, one or two feet apart from each other – a more relaxed positio n, in other words.

But Bruno doesn’t want his troops to be at ease. He  says, “Attention!” The word “attention,” when used in a classroom by a teacher,  means that everyone needs to focus, everyone needs to pay attention. In the m ilitary, especially when the

word is said the way I said it – the way Bruno said  it – it means that you are to stand in a very formal position. You must stand up straight. That is to be “at attention.” It’s a sign of respect for your superio r officer.

In the military, there is a certain hierarchy – tha t is, you have people who are in charge of other people. And so, if you are in the p resence of someone who is at a higher level – what they would call a higher “ran k” (rank) – then you must stand at attention, or least in certain situations you mu st stand at attention. Here, Bruno is telling his soldiers to stand at attention. Then  he says, “Fall in.” “To fall in” means to take your place in line, the place where y ou’re supposed to be. Usually it is said before the troops begin to walk in an or ganized manner.

Walking in a certain organized way, walking in a ce rtain pattern, is called “marching.” We use the verb “to march” (march) to m ean to walk forward in a very organized – I guess what we may call “military ” – way. If you’ve seen soldiers who are all walking down the street in a l ine, such as in a parade, then you know what marching is. “Forward, march” means t o walk forward, to go forward. “Forward, march” is used to tell the soldi ers that they should now start walking. Bruno is telling his soldiers to march.

Marta says, “That’s great, but . . .” Bruno then in terrupts her and says, “I’m not done,” meaning I’m not finished. He says, “Let me s how you what else these troops can do.” He then turns and talks to his troo ps. “Halt! About face!” “Halt” (halt) is a command meaning stop, especially when y ou’re talking to a soldier who is walking. If you tell someone to halt, you’re  telling him or her to stop walking, to stop moving. Outside of the military, y ou won’t hear this word used very much anymore.

There’s an old expression, “Halt! Who goes there?” “Who goes there?” means “Who is there?” If it’s dark outside and you can’t see the face of the person who is walking toward you and you are afraid, you might  say, “Halt! Who goes there?” Well, you actually wouldn’t say that anymore. It’s kind of an old-fashioned expression. “Halt” is used mainly now just in the m ilitary, and that’s the way Bruno is using it in our dialogue.

He says to his troops, “Halt!” – meaning stop walki ng – “About face.” “About face” means to turn around. If you are walking east, “abo ut face” would be to turn around toward the west. It means to move 180 degree s from where you are now so that you are now facing or looking toward the op posite direction. Marta says, “Don’t you think it’s time to . . .?” She’s asking Bruno a question, but Bruno isn’t listening. He’s still talking to his troops.

He says, “March, march! Double time!” “Double time”  is a phrase used in the military to mean “Walk twice as fast as you’re walk ing right now.” “Double time” means to do something twice as quickly as you would  normally do it. Then we hear a child crying – who sounds a lot like me, act ually. Marta then says, apparently to this child, “Come here. Did you fall down and hurt yourself? It’s okay. Everything is going to be okay.” Marta is tal king to this child and asking if the child fell down and hurt himself. Then she says , “It’s okay,” and she tries to comfort the child – she tries to make the child fee l better.

Bruno says, “Hey, there’s no crying in the military .” The “military” refers to the army, the navy, and the other, what we would call, “armed forces” for a given country. Bruno says, “Don’t coddle the troops, Mart a.” “To coddle” (coddle) means to treat someone too kindly or too gently, es pecially when we’re talking about children. Bruno doesn’t want Marta to coddle his troops. Marta says, “Bruno, your twins are five years old.” Now we disc over that these troops that Bruno has been ordering around are, in fact, his fi ve-year-old children.

Marta says, “Don’t you think they’re a little too y oung to be going to boot camp?” “Boot (boot) camp” is typically where you go when y ou first join the military. It’s a place for getting you ready to be part of the army or the navy or the Marine Corps or whatever military service you’re joining. Boot c amp is usually a very difficult period where you must do a lot of physical activiti es in order to get strong enough to be part of the military. Boot camp is also a pla ce where you learn military discipline, and that’s what Bruno is interested in.

He says, “No, it’s never too young to instill disci pline.” “Discipline” (discipline) is the practice of following some set of rules, some s et of regulations or guidelines for behavior. “To instill (instill) discipline” mea ns to train or to teach someone to follow these rules, these guidelines. Bruno says, “ It’s never too young to instill discipline.” He means that even though his children  are only five years old, they are old enough to learn this discipline.

Then he says to his troops. “Okay troops, fall in. Mark time! Now, march, march, march . . .” “To mark time” means to march without walking. So, what you’re doing is you’re walking in place. You’re lifting yo ur legs up as though you were walking, but you’re not actually moving forward. Th at’s “marking time.” Again, it’s a command, an order, that you would hear in the mil itary.

We may also use this expression “He’s marking time”  to mean that he’s not really doing anything. He’s sort of wasting his time or he ’s spending his time waiting for something to end – waiting, perhaps, for something more important to happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Marta: What’s going on out here? What’s all that no ise?

Bruno: I’m putting the troops through their drills.

Marta: Troops?!

Bruno: Watch this. Hey, I didn’t tell you you could  be at ease. Attention! Fall in. Forward, march!

Marta: That’s great, but . . .

Bruno: I’m not done. Let me show you what else thes e troops can do. Halt! About face!

Marta: Don’t you think that it’s time to . . .?

Bruno: March, march! Double time!

Child: Wah! [Child crying loudly.]

Marta: Come here. Did you fall down and hurt yourse lf? It’s okay. Everything’s going to be okay.

Bruno: Hey, there’s no crying in the military. Don’ t coddle the troops, Marta.

Marta: Bruno, your twins are five years old. Don’t you think they’re a little too young to be going to boot camp?

Bruno: No, it’s never too young to instill discipli ne. Okay troops, fall in. Mark time! Now march, march, march . . .
