This episode is a dialogue between Carl and Marla a bout raising teenagers – helping children who are now getting older become b etter people, a very difficult job. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Carl: Hi Marla, I’m really surprised to see you her e. I didn’t know you had kids attending this high school. 

Marla: I don’t – not yet. I heard about this meetin g and decided to attend. It’s best to be ready for those teenage years, don’t you thin k? 

Carl: Sure.  

Marla: I heard that the principal is going to talk about different ways to handle our teenagers as they start asserting their independenc e. I want to be prepared. 

Carl: That makes sense, I guess.  

Marla: I mean, more and more teenagers are rebellin g by getting tattoos and piercings and experimenting with drugs. 

Carl: You’ve clearly done a lot of thinking about t his. 

Marla: I’ve read a few books on the topic, about ki ds having to deal with peer pressure. It’s my job as a parent to set boundaries  and be stricter if it’s called for and ease up when my child needs space. 

Carl: That’s all very insightful, but you have some  time before all that comes into play, right? 

Marla: My little Lucas is already four years old. W ho knows when he might start hanging out with the wrong crowd and being led astr ay. A parent has to be vigilant. 

Carl: Right.

Carl begins our dialogue by saying, “Hi Marla. I’m really surprised to see you here.” Carl wasn’t expecting to see Marla. They obv iously know each other. Carl says, “I didn’t know you had kids attending this hi gh school.” “To attend” (attend) a school means to go there as a student. Carl didn’ t know that Marla had children who were attending, or were students at, this high school. In the United States, high school is usually grades nine through twelve.  

Marla says, “I don’t – not yet. I heard about this meeting and decided to attend.” Marla doesn’t have children going to the high schoo l “yet,” meaning her children are probably either too young or go to a different school, but she’s thinking about sending her children to this high school. She heard  about this meeting and she decided to attend. Notice that verb “attend” again.  Here it means not to be a student of a certain school, but rather go to, in t his case, a meeting.  

Marla says, “It’s best to be ready for those teenag e years, don’t you think?” She’s saying that she’s trying to prepare herself for whe n her children grow up and become teenagers. I should explain that “teenager” means someone usually between the ages of 13 and 19. Those are the “teens ” in English: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. The teenage years are often considered difficult ones for both the teenagers and their parents. Marla doesn’t have tee nagers yet, it sounds like, but she wants to prepare for what will happen when she does, and so she’s going to some meeting at the high school.  

Carl says, “Sure,” meaning “Yes, I agree that you s hould be ready for the teenage years.” Marla says, “I heard that the princ ipal is going to talk about different ways to handle our teenagers as they star t asserting their independence.” The “principal” (principal) is the d irector or the leader of a school, especially a school that is either a high school or  elementary school.  

If it’s a school for older people – that is, someon e who is graduated from high school, such as a college or university – we don’t normally use the word  

“principal.” We might talk about the “president” of  the university or the “dean” (dean) of a college. However, here we’re talking ab out a high school, and so the leader is called a principal. Notice that it’s spel led “-pal” at the end. There’s another word that sounds exactly the same: “princip le.” That spelling of “principle” refers to a belief or an idea behind a certain set of beliefs.  

This talk by the principal is going to be about how  to “handle,” or take care of, “teenagers as they start asserting their independen ce.” “To assert (assert) one’s independence” is to demonstrate through your action s that you don’t need to be or want to be controlled by others. This is especia lly common among teenagers, who are used to being told what to do by their pare nts. They want to separate themselves, in a way, from their parents. They want  to be “independent” – responsible for their own actions. Basically, they don’t want their parents telling them what to do anymore.  

Carl says, “That makes sense, I guess,” meaning it makes sense that Marla wants to prepare herself for her children becoming teenagers. Marla says, “I mean, more and more teenagers are rebelling by gett ing tattoos and piercings and experimenting with drugs.” “To rebel” (rebel) i s to fight against someone or some group that is controlling you. “To rebel” mean s to go against someone – to have a different idea and to demonstrate that you a re opposed to the other person’s ideas or opposed to their control over you .  

Teenagers rebel when they don’t want their parents to control them anymore, perhaps. Teenagers can rebel. They can demonstrate that they want to be independent through a number of different ways. One  way, I guess, would be to get a tattoo. I don’t’ know that many teenagers who  get tattoos. I guess sometimes it is possible for a teenager to get a sm all tattoo, but if you want to get a tattoo in the United States, you usually need the  permission of your parents.  

Some states have laws requiring that a parent give his or her approval for their teenager’s tattoo. Many people who put on tattoos –  we would call them “tattooists” – have their own policies requiring th at teenagers get their parents’ permission even if the law doesn’t require it, but I suppose it does happen.  

Marla also talks about “piercings.” A “piercing” (p iercing) is a small hole that is put in your body, especially in the lower part of y our ear or possibly your nose, where you put a little piece of jewelry – or at lea st that’s what I’m told. Girls often get their ears pierced, although it has become more  common in the last 30 years or so for men to also wear earrings. I’m not one of  them.  

Finally, Marla is concerned about her teenager’s (o r soon-to-be teenager’s)  

experimenting with drugs. “Experimenting with drugs ” means to begin to use illegal drugs such as marijuana and other kinds of drugs. At the time we record this episode, there’s at least one state in the Uni ted States where marijuana is legal, but not for teenagers, certainly. Not yet, I  guess.  

Carl says, “You’ve clearly done a lot of thinking a bout this.” Marla says, “I’ve read a few books on the topic, about kids having to deal  with peer pressure.” “Peer (peer) pressure” is the influence that your friends  – especially your classmates in high school – have on you, the influence that the p eople around you have on you, who are the same age as you. Usually we use th is expression when talking about elementary and secondary schools – that is to  say, grade schools and high schools.  

Marla says, “It’s my job as a parent to set boundar ies and be stricter if it’s called for and ease up when my child needs space.” There a re several words there that need explaining. The first is the expression “to se t (set) boundaries (boundaries).” A “boundary” is a limit to something . Usually it’s where two different countries or two different geographical a reas come together. It’s the line that separates them.  

“To set boundaries,” however, means to have limits on what your children can do. That means, of course, there are things that th ey can’t do, and so the parent sets the rules – sets the boundaries – for the beha vior of his or her children. “To be strict” (strict) means to have a lot of rules or  rules that the person may consider very restrictive, that don’t allow him to do very much. “Strict” also has the idea of not making any exceptions to the rule. You have to follow the rule exactly as it is stated.  

The phrasal verb “to call for” means to require, to  need. So, Marla is talking about being stricter “if it’s called for” – if it’s requi red. She also mentions “easing up.” “To ease (ease) up” means to become more relaxed, t o be less strict. It’s the opposite of “strict.” If your child “needs space,” your child wants to have more privacy, more opportunities to be alone without oth er people. So, all of these expressions together now: “It’s my job,” says Marla , “as a parent to set boundaries and be stricter if it’s called for and e ase up when my child needs space.”  

Carl says, “That’s all very insightful,” meaning th at all indicates that you have a deep understanding of this topic, “but you have som e time before all that comes into play, right?” The expression “to come into pla y” means to take place, to happen. Marla says, “My little Lucas is already fou r years old. Who knows when he might start hanging out with the wrong crowd and  being led astray?” Marla’s  

child is only four years old, which means he has ni ne years before he becomes a teenager, but Marla is concerned.  

Marla says, “Who knows when he might start hanging out with the wrong crowd.” The expression “to hang (hang) out with the wrong c rowd (crowd)” means to spend time with people that may have a negative inf luence on you. Parents are rightly – correctly – concerned about who their chi ldren have as friends, because friends have a lot of influence on us. Children lea rn all sorts of things from their friends, and so you want to make sure they’re learn ing the right thing.  

Nobody says, “Oh, my child is a slow learner, so it ’s okay if he hangs out with the wrong crowd.” No. “We learn from the company we kee p” is an old expression. We learn from the people around us. We often act th e way they act, and so you want your child to be around other children, your t eenager to be around other teenagers, who have a good influence on them, not a  negative one. That’s why Marla is concerned about her child being “led (led)  astray (astray).” “To be led astray” means to be influenced to do bad things. Wh en a good person starts to do bad things, he or she has been “led astray.”  

“A parent has to be vigilant,” Marla concludes. “To  be vigilant” (vigilant) means to always be watching out for difficulties and dangers  and to be prepared to do something about them. “To be vigilant” means to be careful, to be watchful, to make sure in this case that your teenager doesn’t h ang out with the wrong crowd.  

Carl concludes our dialogue by saying, “Right,” but  although normally “right” means “Yes, I agree,” Carl says it in a way that ma kes it clear that he doesn’t really agree. He in fact thinks perhaps Marla is a little crazy worrying about her four-year-old son and what he will do when he’s a t eenager.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
