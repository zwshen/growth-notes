[start of dialogue] 

Ella:  It’s so exciting that you’ll be spending a m onth studying in McQuillanland this summer. When do you start packing? 

Marty:  I’ve already started. The organizers of the  program gave me a list of things I need to bring. 

Ella:  That’s really helpful. 

Marty:  Yeah. They say that it’s essential that I b ring both warm-weather and cold-weather clothes. The weather in McQuillanland is really unpredictable. 

Ella:  Oh, I didn’t know that. 

Marty:  Yeah, and they say that it’s advisable that  I bring medications for every malady I can think of because there are a lot of he alth dangers. 

Ella:  Wow, I never knew that about McQuillanland. 

Marty:  Me, neither. And while it’s optional, it’s also suggested that I leave all of my valuables at home. McQuillanland has a very high  crime rate and visitors are often targeted. 

Ella:  Geez, that’s a lot to take in. 

Marty:  You’re telling me. And the list says that i t is absolutely required that I take a self-defense course before going. You never know what to expect in McQuillanland. 

Ella:  You’re not having second thoughts about goin g, are you? 

Marty:  No, why?

Ella begins our dialogue by saying to Marty “It's s o exciting that you'll be spending a month studying in McQuillanland this sum mer.” McQuillanland is one of those difficult to find countries on a map! Ella  says, “When do you start packing?” To “pack” (pack) here means to prepare fo r a trip by putting all of your things into a suitcase or a piece of luggage or a b aggage. Pack has a number of meanings in English, however. Almost all of them – well, some of them are in the Learning Guide. 

Marty says, “I've already started. I already have b egun. The organizers of the program, the people who are in charge of the progra m gave me a list of things I need to bring.” Ella says, “That’s really helpful.”   Marty says, “Yeah,” our informal way of saying yes. Marty says, “They say that it's essential that I bring both warm-weather and cold-weather clothes. It's “essent ial.” It's necessary. It's important that I bring warm weather and cold weathe r clothes.  

“Warm-weather clothes” would be clothing you would wear when it's hot out and obviously “cold-weather clothes” would be clothing you would wear when it's cold out. Marty says, “The weather in McQuillanland is r eally unpredictable. “Un” (un) as a prefix that goes before a word means not, so “ unpredictable” means not predictable. Something that is predictable is somet hing you can know in advance before it happens. You know what's going to happen.  But unpredictable is when you don’t know what is going to happen. And that’s the way the weather is in McQuillanland. Here in Los Angeles, it's much more predictable. 

Ella says, “Oh, I didn’t know that.” Marty says, “Y eah.” (He likes to say “yeah” a lot.) “Yeah, and they say that it's advisable that I bring medications for every malady I can think of.” “Advisable” comes from the verb to “advise” (advise). It means it's recommended. It's a good thing to do. Yo u don’t have to do it, but it's a good thing. It will help. If you want to improve yo ur English, it's good to listen to these audio mp3 files, but it's advisable to get th e Learning Guide. Of course, what else would I say? Marty says it's advisable th at he bring “medications,” that is medicines, things that you take, drugs that you take for your health “for every  

malady.” A “malady” (malady) means an illness or a sickness. Marty is supposed to bring medications for every malady he can think of because there are a lot of health dangers in McQuillanland, which I don’t thin k is really true. I don’t know where the scriptwriter is getting her information. Anyway, health dangers would be things that may make you sick, things that are d angerous to your health. 

Ella says, “Wow, I never knew that about McQuillanl and.” Yeah, of course you didn’t because it isn't true, Ella! Marty says, “Me , neither,” meaning neither did I. “And while it's optional,” Marty says, “it's also s uggested that I leave all of my valuables at home.” Something that’s “optional” mea ns something that is not required. It's a good idea, but you don’t have to d o it, sort of like advisable. “While it's optional,” he says, “it's also suggested that I leave all of my valuables at home.” To “suggest” means to recommend. To say it's  a good idea. Here’s something you might want to do – that’s to suggest.  It's suggested that Marty leave all of his valuables at home. A “valuable” is  anything that is worth a lot of money. It could be jewelry like a ring. It could be  your cellphone. It could be, I don’t know, one of our Learning Guides, something y ou wouldn’t want anyone to steal. Those would all be valuables. Marty is sayin g that he’s been told basically it's dangerous in McQuillanland because that’s why you would not want to bring your valuables. 

In fact, in the next sentence he says, “McQuillanla nd has a very high crime rate and visitors are often targeted.” A “crime rate” re fers to the number of crimes that happen in a population. Crimes are illegal things, things that are done typically against other people or other people’s property. So , killing someone would be a crime. Stealing from someone would be a crime. But Marty is saying is that there is a lot of crime in McQuillanland and visitors, pe ople who are visiting McQuillanland are often targeted. “Targeted” comes from the verb to “target” (target). To target means to do something that affe cts a particular group of people, to intentionally affect a group of people. You want to just go after a certain group. So, on Saturday morning if you watch  television, a lot of the commercials, a lot of the advertisements are target ed toward children. That’s their audience. That’s who they are making the comm ercial for. Well, you can use targeted either in a positive or a negative sen se. Here it's used in a negative sense. What Marty is saying is that these criminals , these people who commit or do crimes, look for visitors and they are the ones that they rob or do something bad to. 

Ella says, “Geez, that’s a lot to take in.” To “tak e in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to get some new information and to really u nderstand it, to accept it, to think about it and say “Yes, I understand everythin g that is being told me.” In this  

case, Ella is obviously surprised to hear these lie s – and they are lies! – about McQuillanland. 

Marty says, “You're telling me.” This is a pretty c ommon informal phrase. We use it to show that you completely agree with what anot her person has said. It's often used when you have just heard someone say something  critical or negative, often you are communicating to them that you have h ad a similar experience or that you think the same way. “You're telling me” is  a way really of saying you don’t need to tell me. I already know that. I have personal experience with that, for example. 

Marty says, “The list says that it is absolutely re quired that I take a self-defense course before going.” To “require” means to say it is necessary. It is something you must do. Other words we would use would be “obl igatory” or “mandatory.” Marty says it is required that he take a self-defen se course. “Self-defense” is learning how to protect yourself against someone wh o might hurt you, someone who might attack you. Marty says, “You never know w hat to expect in McQuillanland.” Now, this is absolute nonsense of c ourse. McQuillanland is a very safe place. There are no crimes. I don’t know what's going on in this dialogue. These people are crazy. I'm going to have  to talk to the scriptwriter about this. I'm not happy. I'm not happy. McQuillan land, trust me it's a very nice place! 

Ella says, “You're not having second thoughts about  going, are you?” To have “second thoughts” means to have doubts, to question  whether one is doing the right thing. Marty says, “No, why?” meaning why sho uld I have second thoughts. Well, you shouldn’t have second thoughts Marty beca use McQuillanland is one of the best places to go. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Ella:  It’s so exciting that you’ll be spending a m onth studying in McQuillanland this summer. When do you start packing? 

Marty:  I’ve already started. The organizers of the  program gave me a list of things I need to bring.

Ella:  You’re not having second thoughts about goin g, are you? 

Marty:  No, why?
