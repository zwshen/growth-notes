This episode is a dialogue between Amy and Jacob about th eir living room furniture.  The “living room” is the large room where  people normally sit on a couch and watch television, talk to each other.  They are g oing to talk about the furniture – the things that they have inside their livin g room that they use and sit on.  They’re going to talk about different types of li ving room furniture, so it will be a good vocabulary episode.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Amy:  I think rearranging the furniture will make the  living room look more spacious.  Don’t you?

Jacob:  Uh, sure.

Amy:  Can you help me move this couch against this wall?

Jacob:  Okay, but are you sure you want it over there?  B ecause it’s really heavy and a pain to move.

Amy:  I’m sure.  Let’s move the loveseat across from it.  N ow, can you move the recliner into the corner?

Jacob:  Uh!  Here?

Amy:  Umm…a little to the left.  Perfect!

Jacob:  Are you sure?

 Amy:  Absolutely!  Okay, the end tables go on each side of the couch, and the coffee table goes between the couch and the loveseat.

Jacob:  Where do you want the ottoman and where do the  lamps go?

Amy:  Put the ottoman next to the loveseat.  The table  lamps go on the end tables and the floor lamp should go next to the recline r.

Jacob:  There’s no room for the rocking chair.

Amy:  Hmm…I guess the rocking chair can go into the guestro om.

Jacob:  What about the credenza?

Amy:  You’re right.  This new configuration won’t work.

Jacob:  You mean you want to put everything back to where  it was?

Amy:  Yup, we’re back to square one!

Amy begins our dialogue by saying, “I think rearranging t he furniture will make the living room look more spacious.”  “To rearrange” mea ns to change the position of objects in a particular area, to move thing s from one place to another. You can rearrange the things on your desk.  You can put yo ur computer on the left side, your pens on the right side; you can move them  around – you can rearrange them.

Amy wants to rearrange the furniture in the living roo m.  “Furniture” refers to things like chairs, couches, tables, and so forth.  They are in the living room, the main or large room in the house; Amy wants it to look m ore spacious.  “More spacious” means with a lot more space, or simply larger, in  this case.  So she thinks that by rearranging the furniture, you can make the living room look larger than it is.

Jacob says, “Oh, sure.”  He’s not too excited, as most husband s probably wouldn’t be!  Amy says, “Can you help me move this couch ag ainst this wall?” The “couch” is another word for the sofa; it’s a large piece of furniture that three or more people can sit on.  Usually it’s in a straight li ne – it’s a long rectangle. It’s very common in American living rooms to have a big cou ch where several people can sit together.  Amy is asking Jacob to help move this couch “against

 the wall,” meaning close to that wall.  Jacob says, “Oka y, but are you sure you want it over there?  Because it’s really heavy and a pain  to move,” meaning it’s very difficult to move; it’s very heavy, it weighs a lot.  Amy says, “I’m sure.  Let’s move the loveseat across from it.”  A “loveseat” (one word ) is another word for a small sofa, usually with room for just two people.  It’ s called a loveseat because there are just two people, so if it’s a little small le t’s hope that you like the person next you!

Amy wants to move the loveseat across from the couch – in fro nt of, on the other side of the couch.  Amy says, “Now, can you move the reclin er into the corner?” A “recliner” (recliner) is a piece of furniture you sit o n; it’s basically a large chair. But normally, it is possible to move the chair so that it  lies flat, or closer to like a bed.  So you can sit up like a regular chair, but then  you can usually move it so that the back of the chair leans back even farther, so you a re almost lying down.

Well, Jacob says, “Uh!  Here?” and Amy says, “Umm…a little to  the left,” meaning move it a little bit to the left.  Jacob asks, “A re you sure?”  Amy says, “Absolutely!” meaning yes, I’m definitely sure.  Then she says, “Okay, the end tables go on each side of the couch.”  An “end table” is a small table in a living room.  Usually they are placed on both ends of a couch o r a loveseat.  They’re places where people can put their glasses or cups if they are drinking something, for example.  Amy says that she wants the end tables to go on each side – on both sides of the couch, and the coffee table to go bet ween the couch and the loveseat.  A “coffee table” is a larger table.  It’s shor t, meaning it’s low to the ground; it’s not a tall table, but it’s long, and you  will often see a coffee table in front of a large couch in an American living room.  It’ s a place like an end table, where you can put your coffee cup or magazines.  Some p eople like to buy big books with colorful photographs that they put on their c offee table.  These are even called “coffee table books,” the kind of books that ha ve beautiful pictures that people can look at.  Actually, nobody ever looks at th em; they’re just there to look nice!

Jacob then says, “Where do you want the ottoman and where  do the lamps go?” An “ottoman” (ottoman) it is a piece of furniture tha t looks like a small table, but there is a cushion on top of it.  It’s made of some sort  of soft fabric or leather, and it’s used not as a table but to put your feet on.  If yo u are sitting on the couch or the loveseat, it’s a place where you can put your feet up  so that your legs are horizontal.  Amy says, “Put the ottoman next to the lovesea t.  The table lamps go on the end tables and the floor lamp should go next to the recliner.”  A “table lamp” is a lamp, something with a light bulb in it, t hat you put on, of course, a table, like an end table.  A “floor lamp” is taller; it sits on the floor and can be put just about anywhere.

 Amy wants the floor lamp to go next to the recliner.  Jacob says, “There’s no room for the rocking chair.”  A “rocking chair” is a special  chair that has curved pieces of wood or metal that allow you to go back and fo rth, back and forth.  A young mother with her baby might use a rocking chair to g o back and forth, to have that gentle movement to help the baby calm down o r even to fall asleep.  I don’t know!  Rocking chairs have been associated also with older people – grandma and grandpa sitting in a rocking chair.  So it’ s a chair, but it doesn’t have four legs that sit on the ground.  Instead, it has these semi-circular pieces of wood or metal – usually wood – that go back and forth,  that allow you to move the chair back and forth as you sit on it.

Amy says that she guesses the rocking chair can go into the gu estroom.  A “guestroom” in a house is an extra bedroom where people  who are visiting can stay – can sleep.  Not every house is big enough to have a g uestroom.  If you have a big house, and you don’t have very many people livi ng at your house, you may have more than one guestroom.  I don’t have any guest rooms, just so you know!

Jacob says, “What about the credenza?”  A “credenza” is a l arge, short piece of wooden furniture.  It doesn’t have any legs, but there are doors and shelves in it. It’s used to put books or dishes or other items.  So it’s l ike a short cabinet where you store things – where you can keep things.  Amy then sa ys, “You’re right. This new configuration won’t work.”  “Configuration” d escribes the way that something is arranged or ordered, the way things work to gether.  Amy is saying this new arrangement of the furniture – this rearrang ement isn’t going to work. The configuration won’t work; it’s not good, it’s not a  good way of arranging things.

Jacob then says, “You mean you want to put everything back t o where it was?” He’s asking if Amy wants him to move all furniture where it was before they started rearranging, and Amy says, “Yup (meaning yes), we’ re back to square one!”  The expression “to be back to square one” means to  return to a point or a situation where you began.  You haven’t made any progre ss; you didn’t get any benefit from all the work you did.  So if you are, for example, working on a project and everything is on your laptop computer, and then you  lose your laptop computer, you don’t have any of those files saved anywhere else.  You’re back to square one, you have to start at the beginning again, yo u have to start over.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
