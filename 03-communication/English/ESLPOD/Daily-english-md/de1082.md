This episode is a dialogue between Leandro and Alys son about going to an island far, far away. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Leandro: When you said you got a plum job working a broad, I thought you were going to Europe or Asia. Where exactly is Hueller I sland?

Alysson: It’s in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. H ere, I’ll show you on the map.

Leandro: Wow, I had no idea you’d be working in suc h a far-flung place. It’s a bit remote, isn’t it?

Alysson: It is, but it’s also unspoiled and beautif ul. I’ve seen photos and it looks like my idea of paradise. See? After I get settled,  you should come for a visit.

Leandro: It looks a little desolate. Is it hard to get to?

Alysson: You would need to take a 19-hour flight fr om here to the mainland and then a two-day boat ride to reach it.

Leandro: Aren’t you worried about living in such is olation? It’s so far from civilization.

Alysson: There are other people living on the island, you know, so it’s not like I wouldn’t see another living soul for days.

Leandro: Oh, I’m glad there’s a community living there. What is the population of Hueller Island?

Alysson: It’s small, which isn’t unusual for an isl and this size.

Leandro: How small?

Alysson: When I move there, it’ll increase to seven . And if you visit, you’ll make eight.

Leandro: I’ll give the idea of that trip all the co nsideration it deserves.

[end of dialogue]

Leandro begins our dialogue by saying to Alysson, “ When you said you got a plum job working abroad, I thought you were going to Europe or Asia.” A “plum (plum) job” is a very desirable job – a good job th at perhaps pays a lot or has a lot of benefits. This expression “a plum job” is ac tually quite old in English. It goes back at least to the nineteenth century. A “plum” is a small, sweet fruit that was considered very desirable, and so we have a “plum j ob,” meaning a very desirable job.

Leandro is asking Alysson about a plum job that she  got working abroad. The term “abroad” (abroad) means in another country – in a “foreign country,” we could also say. Leandro thought Alysson was getting  a job in Europe or Asia. Instead, she appears to be working somewhere called  “Hueller Island.” An “island” is a piece of land surrounded by water. Le andro wants to know where Hueller Island is. Alysson says, “It’s in the middl e of the Pacific ocean. Here, I’ll show you on a map.” A “map,” of course, is a diagra m or drawing of a certain place, a geographical location.

Leandro says, “Wow, I had no idea you’d be working in such a far-flung place.” The term “far-flung” (flung) means very far away, a t a very long distance from here. We might also use the term that is used in the title of this episode, “remote” (remote). Something that is remote is very far away  from other people – very far away, often, from cities or what we might loosely c all “civilization.” It might be a place that is “isolated” – that is, it’s not next to anything else. It is at a great distance from other places.

Leandro says it’s a very remote place – he says, “I t’s a bit remote, isn’t it?” “A bit” means a little bit, a small amount. Alysson says, “ It is, but it’s also unspoiled and beautiful.” Something that is “unspoiled” is someth ing that is not spoiled. So, you

need to know the definition of “spoiled.” Something  that is spoiled is something that is ruined, something that has gone bad, someth ing that is in a very poor condition or state. So, “unspoiled” would be a place where very few people have gone – a place that is still, in this case, beautif ul.

Alysson says, “I’ve seen photos,” meaning photograp hs of this island, “and it looks like my idea of paradise.” “Paradise” (paradi se) is a perfect place, an ideal place. In some religions, it’s associated with the idea of heaven – a place where you go when you die (if you’re good, of course). Bu t we also use it to describe a beautiful place to visit or often to go on vacation .

Alysson says, “After I get settled, you should come  for a visit.” “To get settled” means to become comfortable in a new place or a new  position, especially if you are moving from one place to another. If you move f rom one city to another, it takes a while for you to get settled – to get every thing in the right place, to figure out where everything is in your new city, and so forth. Alysson is inviting Leandro to come and visit her.

Leandro says, “It looks a little desolate.” “Desola te” (desolate) means empty. It’s a negative way of describing a place that looks lik e it doesn’t have very much there. If you drive out into the middle of the dese rt outside of Los Angeles, many parts of it seem desolate. They seem as though ther e is nothing there. There is nothing interesting there, although some people love the desert, and so for them, it’s not desolate at all. Leandro says, “Is it,” me aning the island, “hard to get to?” “Is it hard to travel to?” is what he’s asking.

Alysson says, “You would need to take a 19-hour fli ght from here to the mainland and then a two-day boat ride to reach it.” We use the term “mainland” (mainland) to describe a country that includes one or more isl ands. However, most of the land of the country is on one of the seven continen ts: North America, South America, Africa, Asia, Europe, Antarctica, and Aust ralia.

So, in the United States, for example, the mainland  consists of the parts of the United States that are part of the North American c ontinent. It does not include the islands, say, of Hawaii, or of Puerto Rico, or of Guam, or of the U.S. Virgin Islands, or other U.S. territories. The mainland, then, is the main part of the country that is located on one of the seven contine nts. Now, it gets a bit confusing, of course, because Australia is also an island, but you understand the general idea here.

The mainland is the main part of the country. Unles s, of course, the country is itself mostly an island. Then you wouldn’t talk abo ut the mainland, since the

entire country is an island. It’s only used when a country has both islands and a significant amount of land on one of the continents . Alysson is describing this island and is telling Leandro that he has to fly to  the mainland of whatever country this island is part of and then take a two- day boat ride – a ride in a small ship – in order to get to the island.

Leandro says, “Aren’t you worried about living in s uch isolation?” “Isolation” is when you are alone, when there is no one else aroun d you. He says, “This island is so far from civilization.” “Civilization” means society – a well-developed culture that people have, usually with some sort of establi shed government and social rules and so forth. The word “civilization” can be a tricky one to use nowadays, because traditionally it has been used to describe more industrialized, more Westernized countries and societies versus those th at were less so.

More generally, the term is used to describe a place where there are “services,” shall we say: electricity and water and food and st ores and houses – things that we associate with modern society. Alysson says, how ever, “There are other people living on the island, you know, so it’s not like I wouldn’t see another living soul for days.” The expression “another living soul ” (soul) means another person, another human being.

Leandro says, “Oh, I’m glad there is a community li ving there.” He’s glad. He’s happy that there are lots of other people there on this island as well. He then asks, “What is the population of Hueller Island?” “ Population” is the number of people living in a certain place. Alysson says, “It ’s small, which isn’t unusual for an island this size.” Leandro then asks, “How small ?” meaning exactly how many people are we talking about here.

Alysson answers, “When I move there, it’ll increase  to seven,” meaning the population will go up to seven. “And if you visit, you’ll make eight.” “You’ll make eight” here means that we will have that number of people. In other words, this island only has six people living on it. If Alysson  goes there, the population will go up to seven people, and if Leandro visits, there’ll  be eight people there. Now, normally if you visit a place we don’t count that a s part of the place’s population, but Alysson is speaking in more general terms here.

Well, Leandro clearly is not very interested in vis iting Alysson on this very small island. He says, somewhat sarcastically – somewhat jokingly – “I’ll give the idea of that trip all the consideration it deserves.” “Consideration” means careful thought, when you think about the advantages or dis advantages, the pluses or minuses of something. Leandro is saying that really , he’s not going to think about this at all because it’s not an idea that appeals to him, that he thinks it would be a good one. He’s not going to visit Alysson on this very small island named Hueller island.

Is there a Hueller Island? Well, no. We just made that name up (though there are people named “Hueller”).

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Listening to the scripts of Dr. Lucy Tse, our scrip twriter, is a bit like being in paradise – a wonderful place. Thank you, Lucy.
