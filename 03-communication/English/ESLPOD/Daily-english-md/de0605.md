I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in the beautiful city of Los Angeles, in the state of California, on the North American continent.  This episode, as all our episodes, has a Learning Guide.  It’s an 8- to 10-page guide that gives you a complete transcript of everything we say, as well as additional cultural notes, and vocabulary definitions – lots of fun stuff!

[start of dialogue]  Dad:  What are you working on, honey?  Mariko:  It’s a project for school about the Earth and its place in the universe.  I have to write a report and build a model of what scientists can see with a telescope in space.  Dad:  I can help you with that.  I was always good in science, especially astronomy.  Mariko:  Okay, Dad.  If I need help, I’ll ask you.  Dad:  Is that the report you’re writing right now?  Mariko:  Yes.  Dad:  Make sure you include all of the planets in the solar system.  Mariko:  I plan to, Dad.
