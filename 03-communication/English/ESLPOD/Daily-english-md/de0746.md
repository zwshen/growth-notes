This episode is called “Traveling Over the Holidays .”  It’s a dialogue between Sabrina and Ying using vocabulary that we might use  in talking about traveling during a busy season such as Christmas or Thanksgiv ing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sabrina:  You look like you’re getting ready for ba ttle.

Ying:  In a way, I am.  I’m flying home next week to be with my family over the holidays and you know what holiday travel is like.

Sabrina:  I’ve flown during peak travel season befo re, and now, I try to avoid it at all costs.

Ying:  Well, I can’t this year, so I’m arming mysel f for the experience.  I booked my flights back in September and I have my seat ass ignment.  I’ll print out my boarding passes before I head for the airport, and I’ll keep checking the flight status to make sure the flight is on time.

Sabrina:  I hope you don’t have any tight connectio ns.

Ying:  I change planes in Chicago, but I have two h ours in between flights.  I’m hoping that’ll be enough.

Sabrina:  What’s in that huge bag?

Ying:  Those are my supplies.  If I get snowed in o r if my flight gets cancelled, I’m ready to spend the night in the airport.

Sabrina:  Wow, you really thought this out.  You’re  ready for the worst-case scenario.

Ying:  Forewarned and forearmed.  You won’t catch m e napping!

Sabrina begins by saying, “You look like you’re get ting ready for battle.”  “Battle” (battle) is when two people, or usually two groups of people are fighting, such as two different armies from different countries; it’s  a big fight.  Sabrina says that Ying looks like he’s getting ready for battle.  Yin g says, “In a way, I am.”  “In a way” means in some manner; sort of I am.  “I’m flyi ng home next week to be with my family over the holidays (that is, during the ho lidays) and you know what holiday travel is like.”  Holiday travel in the Uni ted States usually refers to the months of November and December.  In late November we have the Thanksgiving holiday, and in December it’s the Chri stmas and Hanukkah holidays.  So when people refer to holiday travel, they’re usually talking about one of those two events.

Sabrina says, “I’ve flown during the peak travel se ason before, and now, I try to avoid it at all costs.”  “Peak” (peak) is the highe st part of something.  We can talk about the peak of the mountain.  There’s a famous p eak in Colorado called Pikes Peak.  Well, this is the peak travel season, so it’ s the busiest travel time, and that is what Sabrina is talking about.  She says that sh e’s flown, meaning she has flown in an airplane – “flown” (flown) is the past participle of the verb “to fly.”  “I fly,” “I flew,” in the past,” “I have flown.”  Well , Sabrina has flown during the travel season – the peak travel season – and now she tries  to avoid it – get away from it – at all costs.  “At all costs” means no matter what is required, regardless of how difficult or challenging it is.  “I’m going to make sure I pass my test tomorrow at all costs.”  I’ll do anything – well, almost any thing – to pass my exam.

Sabrina tries to avoid traveling during the peak tr avel season at all costs.  Ying says, “Well, I can’t this year, so I’m arming mysel f for the experience.”  “To arm” (arm) as a verb means to prepare yourself by having  all the necessary things you need.  Usually, it refers to someone who is going to be fighting, and “to arm yourself” means to have a gun or perhaps a sword or  a knife.  In fact, we call things that you can use to harm other people – weap ons – we often call them “arms,” in the plural.  The verb “to arm,” then, me ans to have, to get yourself one of these weapons.  Of course, Ying isn’t actually b ringing a gun on the plane; that’s not allowed in most airlines.  However, he is getting himself ready.  He says, “I booked my flights back in September and I have my seat assignment.” “To book” (book) means to make a reservation, to ma ke arrangements.  “I

booked a flight,” that’s a very common expression m eaning I made reservations on an airplane to go somewhere.  “Flights” (flights ) are trips on an airplane from one place to another.  “Be careful you get to the a irport on time so you don’t miss your flight.”  That is, you don’t miss your airplan e that is going to be leaving.  So, “flight” can mean the travel between one place and another.  Sometimes it’s used informally to mean simply the airplane that you are  getting on.  Of course, you can’t go somewhere unless you get on the airplane, so they’re related.  Ying booked his flights back in September.  “Back in” me ans way back, several months ago.  Now it’s November or December; if he’s  speaking about something that was a long time ago or a while ago, then you can use this expression “back in.”  Back in the 1960s, when I was born, there wer e no podcasts.  True!

Ying says that he has his seat assignment.  In most  airplanes they give you a specific seat to sit in.  A “seat” is like a chair on an airplane.  The airplane has different “rows,” lines of seats.  Each row has a n umber, and each seat typically has a letter.  So if you’re in 22A, you’re probably  sitting in row 22; A is usually a window seat, a seat next to the window, and so fort h.  Ying says, “I’ll print out my boarding passes before I head for the airport.”  A “boarding pass” is an official document, usually a piece of paper, although now so me airlines – some companies have cell phone apps that you can use, bu t a boarding pass is sort of like your official ticket to get onto the plane.  I t’s not the same as the ticket, but it’s basically your permission to board the plane.  “To board” means to get on an airplane.  So, Ying has his boarding passes and he’ s going to check his flight status to make sure the flight is on time.  The “st atus” of something is the state or condition, the situation involving that thing.  “Fl ight status” would be whether the plane will be leaving at the time it’s supposed to leave – on time – or whether it’s late.

Sabrina says, “I hope you don’t have any tight conn ections.”  A “connection,” when we talk about airplane travel, is when you fly  to one airport, you get off your plane, you get into a different plane, and travel to the next airport.  So, it’s stopping in one airport on the way to another airpo rt.  So, if you’re flying from Los Angeles to New York, you may make a stop in Chicago , and you may have to change planes.  That would be called “making a conn ection.”  A “tight connection” is when you don’t have very much time to get the next flight.  Let’s say you fly into Chicago at 12 o’clock noon, and yo u have to be on another plane leaving for Atlanta at 12:30.  Well, you only have 30 minutes to get to your next plane; that would be a very tight connection.

Ying says, “I change planes in Chicago, but I have two hours in between flights.” So, he has lots of time before his next plane will leave.  “I’m hoping that’ll be enough.”  I’m hoping that will be enough time.  Sab rina says, “What’s in that huge

bag?”  What’s in that huge piece of luggage, we mig ht also say.  Ying says, “Those are my supplies.”  “Supplies” are the things  you need to do something else; often it relates to food.  Ying says, “If I g et snowed in or my flight gets cancelled, I’m ready to spend the night at the airp ort.”  If you are “snowed in” you are unable to leave the airport because it is snowi ng so much the planes can’t take off or land; they can’t leave the ground becau se there’s too much snow.  “To have your flight canceled” means that the airplane will not go; the airline says no, we’re not going to fly that plane today.  That is h aving your flight canceled.  It’s a terrible thing; it happens, then you have to find a  new plane to get on – a new flight to take.

Sabrina says, “Wow, you really thought this out.”  “To think (something) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to spend a lot of time thinkin g about something: a problem, and how you’re going to solve it.  Sabrina says, “Y ou’re ready for the worst-case scenario.”  A “scenario” is a possible situation, s omething that might happen. “Worst-case” would be the worst possible thing that  could happen.  So for example, if you are flying and you get snowed in an d you can’t leave the airport for two days, that might be considered a worst-case  scenario, a situation that would be the worst possible one you could have.

Ying says, “Forewarned and forearmed.”  “To be fore warned” means that you know about something bad that’s going to happen bef ore it happens; someone tells you, someone warns you.  “Forearmed” means to  be armed or to be prepared before it happens.  The more common expres sion is “forewarned is forearmed,” if you know about it, then you can prep are for it.  But it’s also possible to say, as Ying says, “forewarned and fore armed,” he’s both of those things.  He knows something bad might happen and he ’s prepared.  He says, “You won’t catch me napping!”  “To nap” (nap) means  to sleep a short time usually some time in the middle of the day.  In the  afternoon, perhaps, you nap for 10 or 15 minutes.  You go into a chair or lie d own on a couch and you fall asleep.  “To catch (someone) napping,” however, mea ns to find someone who is sleeping and therefore unprepared.  So the expressi on “to catch me napping” would mean to find me unprepared, to be in a diffic ult situation and I wasn’t ready for it.  Ying says, “You won’t (you will not) catch  me napping!”  He will be, in other words, prepared.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
