This episode is a dialogue between Vera and Wang ab out how we describe the way the clothing fits – how it looks and feels on y ou. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Vera: How do these pants look on me? 

Wang: Uh, aren’t they a little too tight? They look  like they’re cutting off circulation in your legs. 

Vera: They’re a little snug, but they show off my c urves, don’t they? 

Wang: I suggest going up a size. Something a little  less formfitting would be a lot more comfortable.  

Vera: I’m not going for comfort. I’m going for styl e.  

Wang: Here, try these pants. They’re looser and off er more room.  

Vera: These don’t show my shape at all. They’re not  in the least flattering. 

Wang: But you can move in them without busting a se am. 

Vera: You’re missing the point. I want to look good  in these pants no matter what. 

Wang: Spoken like a true slave to fashion!

 Vera asks her friend Wang, “How do these pants look  on me?” Vera wants to know how a pair of pants look on her, meaning do th ey look good, do they make her look fat, and so on. Wang says, “Uh, aren’t the y a little too tight?” If we say a pair of pants or a shirt is “tight” (tight), we mea n it’s a little too small for you. It fits against your skin so much so that it looks small on  you.  

Wang says, “They look like they’re cutting off circ ulation in your legs.” Wang is telling Vera that the pants she has on look like th ey’re “cutting off circulation” in her legs. “To cut off circulation” means not to all ow blood to flow or go freely into a certain part of your body. Wang is saying that th ese pants are so tight on Vera’s legs that the blood isn’t able to go there c orrectly. He probably doesn’t mean that literally, but he’s trying to emphasize t o Vera that they’re too small for her.  

Vera doesn’t agree exactly. She say, “They’re a lit tle snug, but they show off my curves, don’t they?” If something is “snug” (snug),  it’s a little too small – perhaps not so small that you can’t wear it, but a little t ight. Vera recognizes that the pants are a little too small for her, but she says they’r e just a little snug. However, she likes them because they “show off her curves.” “To show something off” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to reveal, to let other p eople see easily.  

Your “curves” (curves) are, in this case, the parts  of one’s body, especially a woman’s body, that seem to go out from the straight  line of a body – so basically, a woman’s rear end, her butt, and her breasts. Thos e would be her “curves.” Vera wants “to show off” her curves – to let other people see them more easily. Wang says, “I suggest going up a size.” “To go up a  size” (size) means to use or try a piece of clothing that is a little bigger, th at is one size bigger.  

In the United States, as in most countries, clothin g is given a number. That number is related to how big a piece of clothing is . This can be very confusing because different countries use different numbering  systems for shoes, for pants, for shirts, and so forth. That’s why if you’re goin g to a different country and you want to buy some clothes, it’s usually a good idea to try them on first. “To try a piece of clothing on” means to put it on your body and see if you like it.  

Wang suggests that Vera go up a size in the pants, meaning she try a pair of pants that is a little bigger. He says, “Something a little less formfitting would be a lot more comfortable.” Something that is “formfitti ng” is something that is a little snug, perhaps even a little tight on someone – that  fits against his or her skin with very little extra room in between the piece of  clothing and the skin.  

Vera says, “I’m not going for comfort. I’m going fo r style.” The phrasal verb “to go for” something here means to try to have or do some thing, to have a particular goal or intention. If someone says, “I’m going for comfort,” he means that’s what he wants from this piece of clothing. He wants it t o be comfortable. Vera isn’t going for comfort. She’s going for style – that is,  she wants the piece of clothing to look good on her.  

Wang says, “Here, try these pants. They’re looser a nd offer more room.” For a pair of pants to be “looser” (looser) means that it  is a little bigger and not as tight as something else. It has more room, that is to say , between the actual cloth or fabric of the pair of pants and your skin. Wang say s that these pants he is asking Vera to try on, “offer more room.” “Room” here mean s space. A piece of clothing that offers more room means you can move around in it more easily.  

Vera says, “These don’t show my shape at all.” Vera  is concerned that the pants Wang suggests to her won’t let people see the shape  of her body, and that’s what she wants in order to be stylish. She says, “T hey’re not in the least flattering.” Something that is “flattering” (flatte ring) is something that makes one appear more beautiful or more attractive. The verb “to flatter” means to say something to someone in order for that person to li ke you – to say something complimentary about him or her, to say something ni ce about him or her.  

If you say to a woman, “You look very beautiful tod ay,” you perhaps are trying to flatter her. You’re trying to say something nice to  her so that she will think that you are nice or that you like her, perhaps. “Flatte ring” can be used to describe a piece of clothing that looks good on someone – that  makes that person look more attractive or more beautiful. So, you can see the connection between the verb “to flatter” and the adjective “flattering.”  

Vera says that the pair of pants that Wang gave her  are “not in the least flattering,” or are not flattering in the least. Wh en we say something is “not flattering in the least” or “not in the least of an ything,” we mean not at all, not even a little bit. If someone says, “Are you hungry ?” and you say, “I’m not hungry in the least” (or “I’m not in the least hungry”), y ou mean that you aren’t even a little bit hungry. You are completely without hunge r.  

If you are asked, “Are you concerned that your son isn’t doing well in school?” You might say, “Oh I’m not in the least concerned a bout my son.” Actually, you probably wouldn’t say that. You would be concerned about your son if he isn’t doing well in school, or your daughter, but “to be not in the least” something means that you don’t have that quality even in a sm all amount.  

Am I worried that the Dodgers are not going to win the World Championship of baseball, what we call the World Series (which of c ourse is not the world championship but the championship of the U.S.), I w ould say, “No, I’m not in the least worried.” I know that they are going to win t he World Series this year. Depending on when you listen to this episode, you m ay see that I was right or wrong.   

Back to our story – Vera says that the pair of pant s are “not in the least flattering.” Wang says, “But you can move in them w ithout busting a seam.” “To bust” (bust) means to break something open. A “seam ” (seam) is where two parts of a piece of clothing come together. A seam is usu ally “sewn” (sewn) with a machine nowadays, although in the old days, it was done by hand. You would attach two pieces of fabric, two pieces of material , together in order to make a piece of clothing. The line where those two pieces of material come together is called the “seam.”  

“To bust a seam” would mean basically to wear a pie ce of clothing that is so small that if you moved in it, you would rip it or bust the seam. There’s another expression, “to be bursting at the seams.” “To be b ursting at the seams” means that you are so excited about something that you ca n barely contain yourself – that you are really excited. “I’m bursting at the s eams to tell you some news that I have, some good news.”  

But here, Wang is using the expression “busting a s eam” to mean that the clothing is so tight on Vera that she won’t be able  to move in it without basically ripping the clothing, making the seams come apart. Vera says, “You’re missing the point,” meaning you don’t understand why I’m bu ying these pants. “I want to look good in these pants no matter what.”  

The expression “no matter (matter) what” means rega rdless of what might happen, even if the consequences are bad, I still w ant to do this. “I want to go to the opera tonight no matter what” – even if I have to pay a thousand dollars, even if I have to walk to the Disney Concert Hall in dow ntown Los Angeles. I want to go no matter what.  

When someone says they want to do something “no mat ter what,” he or she means it doesn’t matter what the consequences will be, what the bad effects might be – he or she wants to do this thing. Wang s ays, “Spoken like a true slave to fashion.” The phrase “spoken like” is used to us ually make fun of someone or to characterize someone’s personality or attitude. It’s used to say that this person is typical of a certain kind of person. Let me give  you another example.  

If I say to you, “I need to go to the grocery store . It’s only two blocks away, but I’m going to drive in my car. I’m not going to walk .” You might say to me, “Spoken like a true resident of Los Angeles” – an “Angeleno ,” we call ourselves. “Spoken like a true Angeleno.” That means that’s exactly th e way someone from Los Angeles thinks – that even if I have to go two bloc ks, I’m going to use my car rather than walk there.  

Now this isn’t exactly true for me. I would walk to  a store two blocks away. Three blocks? Meh, I would probably drive. It’s embarrass ing, but I will tell you a story. There’s a big shopping center about a mile from my house, and on one end of the center is a grocery store, and on the other end  of the center is a pharmacy, a drugstore, and the two stores are about maybe a blo ck from each other.  

Once, when I was feeling really lazy, I drove to th e grocery store, parked in front of the grocery store, got my food, got into my car,  drove to the other end of the parking lot, walked in the pharmacy, bought my drug s, and came out. Instead of walking down to the pharmacy, buying my drugs, and then walking back to my car parked in front of the grocery store, I drove b etween the two stores. Now that’s a terrible thing to do, really, but that’s w hat people do in Los Angeles, and I am a terrible person. I keep telling you that. You don’t believe me. Now you know it’s true.  

Anyway, let’s finish our story here. Wang says to V era, “Spoken like a true slave to fashion.” The expression a “slave (slave) to fas hion (fashion)” refers to a person who is always concerned that what he or she is wearing is the latest look, the latest clothing, the most current fashion – wha t everyone else is wearing nowadays. That would be someone who is a “slave to fashion.”  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
