This episode is called “Talking to a Mechanic.”  A “mechanic” is a person who fixes cars – automobiles.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Mechanic:  Hi, I’m the mechanic.  What can I do for  you? 

Amy:  My car is making a very weird noise.  It soun ds like this: gulug, gulug, gulug…  

Mechanic:  Hm, that doesn’t sound good.  Where is i t coming from? 

Amy:  I’m not sure.  When I’m in the car, it sounds  like it’s coming from the engine, but when I get out of the car, it sounds li ke it’s coming from directly under the trunk, maybe the muffler?   

Mechanic:  That’s not a noise a muffler would make.   Let me take a look.  Can you start the car and pop the hood?   

Amy:  Sure. 

Mechanic:  Well, I don’t hear the sound right now, but your battery needs replacing, you have a coolant leak, your carburetor  needs adjusting, and your spark plugs are shot.  I need to look under the car . 

Amy:  Okay, go ahead. 

Mechanic:  Your brake pads need replacing and your tires need balancing. 

Amy:  But are any of those problems causing that ho rrible noise?    

 Mechanic:  I don’t know.  I don’t hear the noise ri ght now, so it’s hard to tell.  But that’s all work you need to have done on this car a nyway for it to run right.  It’s only a matter of time before your car stops working  if you don’t take care of those problems. 

Amy:  I come in with one problem and you find 10 ot hers.  I guess you should go ahead.  What else can I do? 

Mechanic:  Um, buy a bus pass?

Our episode begins with the “mechanic,” the person who fixes cars, asking – or rather saying, “I am the mechanic.  What can I do f or you?”  How can I help you? Amy says, “My car is making a very weird noise (a v ery strange noise).  It sounds like this: gulug, gulug, gulug…”  The mechanic says , “Hm, that doesn’t sound good.  Where is it coming from?”  Where is the soun d coming from?  Amy says, “I’m not sure.  When I’m in the car, it sounds like  it’s coming from the engine.” The “engine” is the motor; it’s the part of the car , usually in front, that makes the car go; it gives it power.  Amy says, “but when I g et out of the car, the noise sounds like it’s coming from directly under the tru nk, maybe the muffler?”  The “trunk” (trunk) is the back part of the car, the pa rt that usually you store things in – you put things in to keep while you are driving.  Amy says that the sound sounds like it’s coming from under or underneath th e trunk.  “Maybe,” she’s guessing, “the muffler?”  A “muffler” (muffler) is a part of the car that muffles or covers – lessens – the noise from the car.   

The mechanic says, “That’s not a noise a muffler wo uld make.”  So the sound that Amy made didn’t sound like a sound a muffler w ould make, according to the mechanic.  He says, “Let me take a look.  Can you s tart the car (can you turn the car on) and pop the hood?”  The “hood” (hood) here means the cover of the front of the car.  We talked about the trunk of the car i n the back.  The front of the car has a metal cover over it, and we call that the “ho od.”  “To pop the hood” means to open the hood.  In many cars, there’s a little b utton that you either push or pull that unlocks the hood; you push it in or you pull i t out.  That’s where we get the verb “to pop,” to unleash, to unlock in one quick a ction. 

So, the mechanic opens the hood after Amy pops the hood, and although the dialogue doesn’t indicate he clearly had to take so me time to look at the engine and the parts underneath the hood.  He comes back a nd says, “Well, I don’t hear the sound right now, but your battery needs replaci ng.”  Your “battery” is a source  

of stored electrical power that is used to help sta rt the car, as well as for other parts of your car that require electricity.  The me chanic also tells Amy that she has a coolant leak.  “Coolant” (coolant) is a liqui d that you put into the car’s motor – technically into the radiator of the car – that h elps keep the engine cool so it doesn’t get too hot.  A “radiator” is something tha t gives off or radiates heat, in this case to try to get rid of the heat.  You can a lso have a radiator in your house. It’s not the same as a car radiator, but it has the  same function of giving off heat to help warm up your house.  Some old houses still have radiators.  The house that I grew up in had metal radiators all along and  through the house.  But anyway, we’re talking about cars, not my old house.  

The mechanic thinks that Amy has a coolant leak.  A  “leak” (leak) here means the slow movement of liquid coming out of some cont ainer or some hose, usually through a small hole that you don’t want to be ther e.  The mechanic also says that Amy’s carburetor needs adjusting.  A “carburet or” (carburetor) is the part of the car engine that mixes the gasoline with air so that it can be used in the engine.  The mechanic also says that Amy’s spark pl ugs are shot.  The “spark (spark) plugs” are the parts of the car that create  a spark, it’s almost like a small, quick fire to make the gasoline burn and to help ru n the engine.  When we say something is “shot” (shot) – that can have a couple  of different meanings – here it means completely ruined, no longer able to work or function properly.  That’s one meaning of “shot.”  There are other meanings that c an be found in our Learning Guide.  Our Learning Guide also, in this episode, t alks about other meanings of the word “trunk,” which we talked about earlier. 

So the mechanic finds all these problems.  Then he says, “I need to look under (or underneath) the car.”  Amy says, “Okay, go ahea d.”  And again, we assume that the mechanic has taken some time even though i t isn’t indicated in our dialogue.  Either that, or he’s the most intelligen t mechanic in the world!  The mechanic says, “Your brake pads need replacing and your tires need balancing.” Your “brakes” are the parts of the car that slow th e car down or stop the car.  A “brake pad” is a part of the brakes that pushes aga inst part of the wheel in order to slow it or stop it, and typically after so many miles you need to replace or get new brake pads, and that’s what the mechanic is say ing Amy needs to do.  She also needs to have her tires balanced.  Cars typica lly have four wheels, and around the wheel there is something made of rubber that’s called a “tire” (tire). When you put new tires on sometimes they have to be  balanced so that they’re all basically the same in terms of how they’re adju sted. 

Amy says, “But are any of those problems causing th at horrible noise?”  That bad noise that she came in and asked the mechanic about  at the beginning of our dialogue.  The mechanic says, “I don’t know.  I don ’t hear the noise right now, so  

it’s hard to tell.”  When we say something is “hard  to tell” we mean it’s difficult to know, it’s difficult to determine or figure out.  “ But that’s all work (all of those repairs) you need to have done on this car anyway f or it to run right (for it to operate correctly).  It’s only a matter of time,” h e says, “before your car stops working if you don’t take care of those problems.”  “It’s only a matter of time” means that something will definitely happen in the future, eventually.  You don’t know when exactly, but you know if things continue as they are now this thing will eventually happen.  It’s only a matter of time that  all of us are going to die; it will happen to every one of us.  We don’t know when, som eday, hopefully not too soon for most of us. 

Amy then says, “I come in (meaning I come here) wit h one problem (the noise) and you find 10 others.  I guess you should go ahea d (meaning I guess you should go ahead and do the repairs).  What else can  I do?”  That’s something that many of us feel when we go into a mechanic.  W e don’t know what the problem is.  They tell us they know what the proble m is, and they fix it, but we’re never really sure exactly, in most cases, what the problem was.  We have to trust the mechanic to a certain extent.  Amy asks, “What else can I do?”  What other choice do I have but to get these repairs made? 

The mechanic says, “Um, buy a bus pass?”  A “bus pa ss” is usually a little card or a piece of paper that allows you to get on and o ff of the public buses.  You usually pay a certain amount for a week or a month or 10 days.  Or sometimes you pay for the number of rides that you take, you can get on the bus 10 times for example.  All of these are examples of bus pass es.  You can have a pass to a lot of things.  In many cases, it means a ticket to  something, and that’s really what a bus pass is.  It’s a ticket to get on and of f – well, to get on the bus.  They don’t usually ask for a ticket to get off the bus, although that might be a good way of making some more money, I’m not sure. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
