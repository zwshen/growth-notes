On this episode, we have a dialogue between Mona an d Kellan about landscaping a house, or making the land or area aro und the house nice and pretty, Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mona: I want a lawn. I’ve always pictured our new h ouse with a lawn.

Kellan: Lawns require a lot of water and upkeep. I think we should use hardscape for most of the lawn and plant only drought-toleran t plants.

Mona: I don’t want my yard to be full of gravel and  rocks. I picture a water feature in the middle, with annuals and perennials planted all around it, surrounded by a big, beautiful lawn.

Kellan: We can have some kind of slow-growing groun d cover if you want to, but the rest isn’t practical.

Mona: I don’t know what you mean. We can plant a he dge over there and install planters along the walkway.

Kellan: Who will do the pruning and mulching? Who w ill pull the weeds and mow the lawn? Who will rake the leaves when the seasons  change?

Mona: Well, I guess I will, with your help.

Kellan: Don’t count on me. My motto is: No muss, no  fuss!

Mona says, “I want a lawn.” A “lawn” (lawn) is a gr een area around a house or a building with grass that is typically cut short so that it doesn’t look too long, but it looks nice. A lawn is almost always an area of “gre en grass” when we use the term in reference to a house or a building. Mona wa nts a lawn. She says, “I’ve always pictured our new house with a lawn.” She mea ns she’s always imagined having a house with a lawn.

Kellan says, however, “Lawns require a lot of water  and upkeep.” “Upkeep” (upkeep) is another word for “maintenance,” for tak ing care of something so that it looks nice and is in good condition. if you own a house, there is a certain amount of upkeep you have to do every year because houses, like all of us, get older and need repairs and other changes in order to keep them in good condition.

Kellan doesn’t like this idea. He says, “Lawns requ ire a lot of water and upkeep. I think we should use hardscape for most of the yard and plant only drought- tolerant plants.” “Hardscape” (hardscape) refers to  hard surfaces that are used in the outdoor areas around a house or a building that  take the place of grass or plants. Hardscape is usually something that is made  of stone or brick. So, instead of having grass in front of your house or in front of your building, you might have a hardscape, where the whole thing is st one or concrete or another hard surface.

Kellan suggests using “hardscape for most of the ya rd” (yard). The word “yard” is used to refer to the space either in front of a hou se – called the “front yard” – or in back of the house, called the “backyard.” So, “y ard” is a word that we would use to describe that area, that land. If we’re talk ing about a building, a commercial building like an office building, we pro bably wouldn’t use the word “yard” to describe the area in front and in back of  the building. We would use the term “grounds” (grounds). The “grounds of the build ing” refers to the area outside of the building that’s still part of the property of that building.

Kellan wants to use hardscape for most of the yard.  He also wants to plant, or put into the ground, only “drought-tolerant plants. ” Notice that “plant” (plant) can be used as a verb or as a noun. You can plant trees . You could also say that trees are plants. Well, Kellan wants to plant “drou ght-tolerant plants.” “Drought” (drought) is when there isn’t enough water. Here in  California, we quite frequently have droughts. We don’t have enough water. A “droug ht-tolerant plant” is a plant that doesn’t need a lot of water, that can put up w ith, or “tolerate,” a drought – when you don’t have a lot of rain or water.

Mona says, “I don’t want my yard to be full of grav el and rocks.” “Gravel” (gravel) refers to small rocks, especially ones that you wou ld use on the road or on a sidewalk in front of a house. Some of the older roa ds in rural areas, in areas outside of the main cities in the United States, st ill have gravel. Not that many, but if you go into an area where there aren’t a lot  of people, some of the roads may still be gravel roads – small little rocks inst ead of a concrete or asphalt top.

Mona says, “I picture a water feature in the middle , with annuals and perennials planted all around it, surrounded by a big, beautif ul lawn.” Mona is giving us what she wants in the yard. She wants a “water feature.”  A “water feature” refers to something with water, such as a small pool of water  – what we might call a “pond” (pond). Or a water feature could be a “fount ain” – something that sprays or shoots up water into the air.

The term “annuals” (annuals) refers to plants that only live for a single season or a single part of the year. If you want that plant a gain next year, you have to put a new plant in the ground, or new seeds in the ground . “Perennials” (perennials) are plants that live two or more years. So, you don ’t have to put a new plant in the ground next year. It will keep “coming up,” we might say, each year.

Kellan says, “We can have some kind of slow-growing  ground cover if you want to, but the rest isn’t practical.” Kellan talks abo ut “slow-growing ground cover.” “Ground cover” refers to small plants that go acros s the ground but are not very tall. They’re short. What Kellan is saying is that he doesn’t want all these flowers and plants. He just wants something very simple.

Mona says, “I don’t know what you mean. We can plan t a hedge over there and install planters along the walkway.” A “hedge” (hed ge) is a tall, thick-growing plant that you cut usually in straight lines and us e as a sort of border. So, you might have a yard in front of your house, and along  the edge of the yard, along the border of the yard, you might have a plant that  goes all the way around your yard, and you cut it, and that would be what we wou ld call a “hedge.”

Usually hedges are somewhere between two and maybe four or five feet. If they are much taller than that, they become more like tr ees and we probably wouldn’t use the word “hedge.” We use plants called “bushes”  for hedges, more commonly. They’re not that tall.

Mona talks about “planters along the walkway.” “Pla nters” are large boxes, filled with soil, that have plants in them. Instead of put ting the plant in the ground, below the surface of the ground, you have a box tha t has dirt in it, and you put the plant in there. That’s a “planter.” The “walkwa y” (walkway) just refers to the

area where you walk from one place to another in fr ont of a house or a building. A “walkway” usually goes from the sidewalk or the s treet to the front of the house or building.

Kellan says, “Who will do the pruning and mulching? ” “To prune” (prune) means to cut pieces off of a plant or a tree to make it s maller. Sometimes trees or plants get too big and you have to cut them back, you have  to “prune” them. Kellan is asking who is going to do all of this work, to take  care of what Mona wants in the front yard – who is going to prune and “mulch” (mul ch)?

“To mulch” means to put certain kinds of materials on the ground in order to help keep the plants and trees healthy. Sometimes we use  the outside surface of a tree, called the “bark,” as mulch. Sometimes we use  leaves from the tree as mulch. Notice that “mulch,” like “plant,” can be bo th a verb and a noun.

Kellan says, “Who will pull the weeds and mow the l awn? Who will rake the leaves when the seasons change?” “Weeds” (weeds) re fers to unwanted plants – plants that you don’t want in your yard or garden. To get rid of these plants, you have to pull them out of the ground. So, we have the expression “pull (pull) the weeds.” “To mow (mow) the lawn” is to cut the lawn or to cut the grass that is part of the lawn.

“Raking” (raking) refers to taking what looks like a big room and using it to gather together leaves that have fallen off the trees. The re is a verb “to rake,” which means to use an object called a “rake” to gather to gether the leaves, either to get rid of them or to perhaps use them as mulch around other parts of your yard.

Mona says, “Well, I guess I will, with your help.” Mona is saying she’s going to help do all of this work. Kellan says, “Don’t count  on me,” meaning don’t depend on or rely on me doing this work. If you want all t his stuff, you are going to have to do the work. That’s what Kellan seems to be sayi ng. Of course, no rational, sane, intelligent husband would talk to his wife th is way, but this is an imaginary dialogue.

Kellan says, “My motto is: No muss, no fuss!” Your “motto” (motto) is a short expression of either your belief about something, a  rule that you follow, or simply an expression that we associate with a certain inst itution or certain organization. Mottoes often express a certain standard of belief that you have, a rule that you live by. The Boy Scouts have a motto: “Be prepared, ” meaning be ready for anything.

Well, Kellan’s motto is “No muss (muss), no fuss (f uss).” “No muss, no fuss” is a phrase meaning that you want to keep things simple.  You want to reduce amount of work that you have. There’s also an expression w ith the word “fuss”: Don’t make a fuss. “Don’t make a fuss” means don’t cause problems. Don’t complain. Don’t make more difficulties for yourself or for us  than are necessary.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
