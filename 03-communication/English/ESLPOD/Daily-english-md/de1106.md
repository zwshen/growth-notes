This episode is a dialogue about driving your car a nd getting a flat tire. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jaloliddin: What is that thumping noise?

Minisa: I don’t hear anything.

Jaloliddin: I think you have a flat tire.

Minisa: The left rear tire has a slow leak, but I j ust inflated it the last time I was at the gas station, so I’m sure it’s fine.

Jaloliddin: No, really, I think you need to pull of f to the side of the road.

Minisa: We’re on a busy freeway, but if you insist.

Jaloliddin: Wow, your tire is definitely flat. See how the tire is completely worn out, with hardly any tread left?

Minisa: Yeah, well, I’ve been meaning to get a new one. Now what?

Jaloliddin: We need to change it. Let’s see if you have a jack and a spare tire.

Minisa: I think they’re in the trunk, but I don’t t hink I could do it myself.

Jaloliddin: [sigh] Right. I’ll change the tire. Do you have a wrench so I can get the lug nuts off?

Minisa: I have some basic tools in the trunk, too, I think.

Jaloliddin: Put your hazard lights on and I’ll get to work. At least your rim doesn’t look bent.

Minisa: I’m glad to hear that. What should I do?

Jaloliddin: Bone up on basic car maintenance?

This episode is all about getting a “flat (flat) ti re (tire).” A “flat tire” is when you have a tire that no longer has any air in it, usual ly because there’s a small hole in the tire. A tire, I guess I should explain, is what  goes around the wheels of your car. Most cars have four wheels, and around the whe els go tires. The tires usually have air in them. If the tires don’t have a ny air, well, then the car will not move very easily.

In our dialogue, Jaloliddin says to Minisa, “What i s that thumping noise?” “Thumping” (thumping) is an adjective used to descr ibe a heavy, loud noise, usually a sound made by something heavy hitting the  ground or something else. In this case, it’s the sound of rubber hitting the road with a flat tire. Minisa says, “I don’t hear anything.”

Jaloliddin says, “I think you have a flat tire.” Mi nisa says, “The left rear tire has a slow leak, but I just inflated it the last time I w as at the gas station, so I’m sure it’s fine. Minisa doesn’t think she has a problem at all . She does say that “the left rear tire has a slow leak.” A car has front tires i n the – well, logically – front of the car as well as rear tires in the rear or back of the car. There’s a tire on the left and the right side of both the front and the rear of the car.

So the “left rear tire” would be the tire in the ba ck of the car on the left hand side. Minisa says that the tire in the left rear “has a s low leak” (leak). A “leak” is when you have a small hole in something that has either air or liquid in it, that allows the air or liquid to escape, to go out of the conta iner. If a tire has a “slow leak,” as Minisa describes it, it means that air is slowly es caping from the tire, but not so fast that the tire becomes flat.

Minisa says she just inflated the tire the last tim e she was at the gas station. “To inflate” (inflate) in this case means to put air in to something. If your tire is flat, you have to inflate it. You have to put more air into it. We might also say “blow up” the tire. A “gas station” is a place where you buy gaso line for your car. Typically, gas stations also have air pumps, which are machines th at allow you to inflate a tire.

However, Jaloliddin says, “No, really, I think you need to pull off to the side of the road.” “To pull off to the side of the road” means to take your car and park it along the side of a road or a street so that you are not actually on the main part of the road or street. Minisa says, “We’re on a bus y freeway, but if you insist.” Minisa is pointing out that they’re on a freeway, w hich is a special road where people drive fast – at least, if they can.

She says, “But if you insist,” meaning if you absol utely think I must pull off to the side of the road, then I will. At this point, the t wo of them get out of the car to take a look at the tire and Jaloliddin says, “Wow, your tire is definitely flat. See how the tire is completely worn out with hardly any tre ad left?” “To be worn (worn) out” means to be used so completely that you can no long er use it. Something that is worn out has to be replaced. It is no longer usable .

Minisa’s tire hardly has any “tread” (tread) left o n it. The tread of a tire is the thick rubber part that actually holds on to, or grips, the road. If you look at a tire, you can see lines in the rubber of the tire, or the mat erial the tire is made of. That’s the “tread.” If you don’t see any lines, if the tir e is basically smooth, we would say that the tire is “bald” (bald). And you don’t want to drive with tires that are bald. That can be dangerous because you won’t be able to stop easily or quickly if you need to.

Minisa says, “Yeah, well I’ve been meaning to get a  new one,” meaning she had been planning on getting a new tire. Then she asks,  “Now what?” meaning “What do we do now?” Jaloliddin says, “We need to change it,” meaning to put a new tire on, or a different tire on. “Let’s see if you have a jack and a spare tire.” Most cars have a “spare (spare) tire,” which is an extra  tire usually kept in the back of the car, in the car’s trunk, that can be used if yo u get a flat tire. A “jack” (jack) is a small tool that is used to lift the car up so you can take one of the tires off and put a new one on.

We call it a “spare tire,” but it’s really a spare wheel and tire. The rubber tire goes around the metal wheel. Minisa says, “I think they’ re in the trunk,” meaning the jack and the spare tire are in the trunk, “but I do n’t think I could do it myself.” A “trunk” (trunk) is the back part of a car, used for  storing things. It’s not a place

where you could actually sit. Well you could, I sup pose, but it wouldn’t be very comfortable. Minisa says, “I don’t think I could do  it myself.”

Now, Jaloliddin follows the statement by sighing, a s though he doesn’t really want to do it either. I guess he’s not a very nice guy, huh? Anyway, he says, “I’ll change the tire. Do you have a wrench so I can get the lug nuts off?” A “wrench” (wrench) is a metal tool that is used to turn small  pieces of metal called “nuts” that are used to hold, in this case, the tire onto the car. A “lug (lug) nut” is what we call the nuts that are used to hold the wheels o nto the car. Minisa says, “I have some basic tools in the trunk, too, I think.”

Jaloliddin says, “Put your hazard lights on and I’l l get to work.” Your “hazard (hazard) lights” are lights on your car that go on and off – that we would say “flash” on and off – to warn other drivers that you  are parked or that there is some sort of problem with your car. We’re guessing that this is Minisa’s friend and not boyfriend or husband, because if it were a boyfriend or a husband and he didn’t seem very enthusiastic about helping his girlfriend or wife, he probably wouldn’t have a girlfriend or wife for much longer.

Anyway, in this case Jaloliddin says, “At least you r rim doesn’t look bent.” The “rim” (rim) is the edge of the wheel. It’s the part  of the wheel that the tire goes around. If something is “bent” (bent), it has an an gle or a curve in it where it shouldn’t. If your wheel is damaged – if you hit it , for example, against the side of the road or against a curb or a rock – you could be nd the rim in such a way that you damage it. The rim should go around in a circle , and if there’s any break in that circle, then we would say the rim is “bent.” I t isn’t in the correct shape.

Minisa says, “I’m glad to hear that,” meaning I’m g lad to hear that the rim of the wheel is not bent. “What should I do?” she asks. Ja loliddin says, “Bone up on basic car maintenance?” “To bone (bone) up on” some thing means to study something for a short period of time – to try to le arn something quickly. What Jaloliddin is saying is that Minisa needs to learn how to change a tire so that she doesn’t rely on other people – namely, him – to do it. I think you need a new friend, Minisa.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
