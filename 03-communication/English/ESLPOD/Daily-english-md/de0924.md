[start of dialogue]

Camile: That is a really good idea.

Nathan: Thanks, but there’s no way I can get past a ll of the gatekeepers in this company to get access to the president. He’s the on ly one who can green-light a project like this.

Camile: Can’t you present it to your boss first?

Nathan: If I bring the idea to my immediate supervi sor, she’ll either take it over or nix it.

Camile: What you need to do is to get the ear of on e of his advisors and do an end run around the other managers.

Nathan: I’m not sure how I can do that. I don’t kno w any of the advisors in the president’s inner circle. We don’t exactly travel i n the same circles, you know.

Camile: How’s your jump shot?

Nathan: Why do you ask?

Camile: My cousin works at the same gym where the c ompany president goes to exercise. Sometimes he likes to play a game of pick up basketball, often one-on- one. If you got a call from my cousin when he’s the re, you might be able to get there quickly and be in the right place at the righ t time.

 Nathan: You mean talk business on the courts?

Camile: Sure, isn’t that how real deals get made?

Nathan: You might have an idea there.

Camile: Yes, but one piece of advice: Let him win!

Camile begins our dialogue by saying, “That is a re ally good idea.” Obviously, we are coming in in the middle of a conversation that has already started between Camile and Nathan. Nathan says, “Thanks. But there’ s no way I can get past all of the gatekeepers in this company to get access to  the president.” Camile and Nathan are obviously talking about trying to commun icate with the president of some company.

He says, “There’s no way” – it’s not possible for m e – “to get past all of the gatekeepers.” A “gatekeeper” (gatekeeper) is someon e who works for an important person, typically who controls access to that person, who decides who is going to get to see that person and who will not  get to see that person. We usually think of presidents of companies or, certai nly, presidents of countries who have people around them who work for them who contr ol access to that person, who decide who’s going to get to talk to the presid ent and who isn’t. That’s what a “gatekeeper” is. Nathan is worried he can’t get p ast the gatekeepers – that is, he can’t get around them to communicate directly wi th the president. He talks about getting “access to the president.” “To get ac cess” is to be allowed to talk to or communicate with someone.

Nathan says, “The president is the only one” – the only person – “who can green- light a project like this.” The verb “to green-ligh t” means to say yes to something. It’s a very common expression in business, to mean to approve an idea, to say yes to a project. Why “green-light?” Well, of cours e, in a traffic signal, the green light indicates that you can go, that you can move forward. A red light would mean that you should stop. A yellow light, at least  in the United States, means that you need to be careful because the light is go ing to be changing to red soon. For most people, this means you need to drive reall y fast.

Well, Nathan says, “The president is the only one w ho can green-light a project like this.” Camile says, “Can’t you present it to y our boss first?” That is, “Isn’t it possible for you to talk to your boss as the first step?” Nathan says, “If I bring the

idea” – and we don’t know what that idea is – “to m y immediate supervisor, she’ll either take it over or nix it.” Your “supervisor” i s your boss – the person who tells you what to do at your job. Your “immediate supervi sor” is the boss who’s just one level above you. In most companies, you may hav e a boss, and then someone who is their boss, and then someone even hi gher who’s their boss. Your “immediate supervisor” is the boss who’s close st to you, if you will – the one who is just one level above you. The idea is that t hat boss, that supervisor, himself has a boss or a supervisor.

Nathan says if he brings the idea he has to his imm ediate supervisor, “she will either take it over or nix it.” “To take something over” means to fully control something, to say, “Okay. I’m going to now do every thing related to this project.” It’s sort of like stealing it, in a way, except tha t the person who’s taking it over may have the right to do that – may say, “Okay. Wel l, I’m going to say this is my idea, and I’m going to take it over. I’m going to a ct upon it myself.” Nathan says if he gives his idea to his immediate supervisor, “she ’ll either take it over or nix it.” “To nix” (nix) means to reject, to cancel, to say no to something.

Camile says, “What you need to do is to get the ear  of one of his advisors and do an end run around the other managers.” “To get the ear of someone” means to get someone to listen to you, to get someone to pay  attention to you. An “advisor” (advisor) is a person who gives advice an d recommendations to a more important person – a president, or a vice-president , or a boss. Your “advisors” are the people that you ask recommendations from. You ask their opinion about something that’s important to you.

“To do an end (end) run” means to go around, or to bypass, or to skip someone who normally you would have to talk to and get the approval of and, instead, go to someone at a higher level. So, instead of talkin g to your immediate supervisor, you go directly to the president. You go all the wa y around that person. You do an end run. You go around the person. That’s what C amile is recommending to Nathan, that he needs to do an end run around the o ther managers in order to get the ear of one of the president’s advisors.

Nathan says, “I’m not sure how I can do that. I don ’t know any of the advisors in the president’s inner circle.” The phrase “inner (i nner) circle” refers to the closest advisors to an important person like a president. T he president’s or leader’s inner circle would be the small group of men and women th at he or she gets advice from – talks to in order to find out what should be  done next. That’s the inner circle.

Nathan says, “We don’t exactly travel in the same c ircles, you know.” The expression “to travel in the same circles” uses the  word “circle” again but in a different way. It means a group of people who are a t the same social level who are often friends with each other or who have somet hing in common. For example, here in Los Angeles there are some people who know a lot of movie writers, and movie directors, and movie producers. I do not travel in those same circles, meaning none of my friends or people I kno w are movie directors and producers. That’s actually not true. My old neighbo r is a movie producer.

But anyway, the expression “to travel in the same c ircles” means to have the same kinds of friends or to be in the same situatio n where you would know these people. That’s what Nathan is saying is not the cas e for him. He doesn’t travel in the same circles as the inner circle, the close adv isors of the president.

Camile says, “How’s your jump shot?” A “jump (jump)  shot” is something you do in the game of basketball, where you jump up in the  air and try to throw the ball into the round circle called the “basket.” It’s an odd question. So, Nathan says, “Why do you ask?” – “Why are you asking about how I  play basketball?” Camile says, “My cousin works at the same gym” – the same gymnasium – “where the company president goes to exercise. Sometimes, he l ikes to play a game of pickup basketball.” A “pickup” game of anything is when you just play with the people who are there. You don’t plan it. You don’t organize your team in advance. You just go to a place where you think oth er people will be, for example, playing basketball, and you make a team ri ght there. You form your own team. That would be a pickup game of basketball .

Camile says sometimes the president likes to play a  pickup game of basketball, “often one-on-one.” “One-on-one” is when, in basket ball, there are just two people playing – one person versus another person –  and you try to get as many points as you can by throwing the ball through the basketball net. Camile says, “If you got a call from my cousin when he’s there” – in  other words, if Camile’s cousin called Nathan when the president was at the gym – “you might be able to get there quickly and be in the right place at the right time. The expression “the right place at the right time” means to be at a cer tain place at a certain time, where you are able to do what you really want to do . It’s almost like having good luck. “To be at the right place at the right time” means to be somewhere and, even though you didn’t plan it, something good happ ens to you.

Nathan says, “You mean talk business on the courts? ” “To talk business” means to discuss what is happening at your workplace. The  “courts” here refers to the basketball court – the place where you would play t he game of basketball. Camile says, “Sure. Isn’t that how real deals get m ade?” A “deal” is an

agreement. Nathan says, “You might have an idea the re,” meaning “I think that is a good idea.” Camile says, “Yes, but one piece of a dvice.” A “piece of advice” is a recommendation. “Let him win!” – meaning let the president win, allow the president to win. Don’t try to beat him in the game  that you are playing of basketball.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
