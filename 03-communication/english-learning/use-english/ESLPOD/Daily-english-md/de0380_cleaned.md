This episode is called “Hiring Temp Workers.”  “Temp” is short for temporary; this is when companies hire people for short amounts of time to do work.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Bethany:  I just talked to Steve about hiring replacements for Cyril, who quit last month and for Megan, who is leaving at the end of this week.  Do you know what he told me?  He doesn’t want to hire permanent replacements.  He wants to make do with temps!  Enrique:  I can see it from Steve’s perspective.  The economy isn’t so good right now and maybe he’s not sure if we can afford full-time replacements.    Bethany:  But how am I supposed to staff the office to cover all of the work that needs to be done with temps?!   Enrique:  Don’t undervalue temps.  Many of them are very skilled and you may be surprised at how well they do.  I should know.  I worked as a temp right after graduating from college.  Bethany:  You did?  I didn’t know that.  But you went to a great school.  I’m surprised you had trouble landing a full-time job.    Enrique:  Actually, I was offered a full-time job before I graduated, but I turned it down.  I decided I wanted to test the waters in a few different companies before deciding on where I wanted to work.  In retrospect, it was the best thing I could have done.
