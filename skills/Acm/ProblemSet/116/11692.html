<h1>Problem D - Rain Fall</h1>
<h3>Time limit: X seconds</h3>
<!-- author: Mikael Goldmann -->


<p>
Rainfall is measured in millimeters. The rain is collected in a
vertical transparent tube with millimeter markings, and once the rain
has stopped falling, one can check the height of the water in the
tube.

<p>
In our problem, the tube unfortunately has a leak at height <it>L</it>
millimeters (mm). If the water level is above the leak then water
drains from the tube at a rate of <i>K</i> millimeters per hour (mm/h).

<p>
We want to figure out how much rain fell during a particular rainfall.
<it>We assume that the tube is high enough that it does not overflow.
We also assume that rain falls at an (unknown) uniform rate during a
rainfall, and that water does not evaporate from the tube. The height of the 
leak itself is also negligible.</it>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N<40) which denotes the total number of test cases.
The description of each test case is given below:<br><br>

A line with five positive numbers:
<i>L</i> <i>K</i> <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> <i>H</i>
where
<ul>
  <li><i>L</i> is where the leak is (mm)
  <li><i>K</i> is the rate at which water leaks (mm/h)
  <li><i>T<sub>1</sub></i> is the duration of the rainfall (h)
  <li><i>T<sub>2</sub></i> is the time between the end of the rainfall and
    the observation of the water level (h)
  <li><i>H</i> is the water level in the tube when we observe it (mm)
</ul>
Each number is at least 0.01 and at most 1000.00, and each is given
with two decimals.

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each test case print one line with two floating point numbers
<i>F<sub>1</sub></i> <i>F<sub>2</sub></i>
where <i>F<sub>1</sub></i> is the smallest rainfall in millimeters that would result in
the given observation, and <i>F<sub>2</sub></i> is the largest rainfall in millimeters
that would result in the given observation.
Values with either absolute or relative error
smaller than <i>10<sup>-6</sup></i> are acceptable.
