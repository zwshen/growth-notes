This episode is a dialogue between Jerome and Sandy  about having a plan in case there’s a problem with what you’re doing. Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jerome: This is a very dangerous undertaking. Do yo u have a backup plan if anything goes wrong?

Sandy: It’ll work. I’ve come up with contingencies for every possible setback.

Jerome: It’s just that I’d like to know we have som e recourse if anything goes wrong.

Sandy: My plan is foolproof. Failure is not an opti on.

Jerome: But don’t you think we should consider some  alternatives? If, God forbid, anything goes wrong, it would be good to have an es cape hatch, don’t you think?

Sandy: That won’t be necessary. If anything goes wr ong, it’s every man for himself.

Jerome: What?! I thought we were in this together? What happened to, “Stick with me and you can’t go wrong”?

Sandy: That was before I realized what a liability you are.

Jerome: A liability?!

Sandy: In a dangerous plan like this, there are bou nd to be some casualties – a sacrificial lamb or two.

Jerome: Yes, but I didn’t know you’d double-cross m e before we even got started!

Jerome begins our dialogue by saying to Sandy, “Thi s is a very dangerous undertaking.” An “undertaking” (undertaking) is jus t another word for a project, something that you are doing, often something that is a little difficult – a little “challenging,” we might say. Jerome says, “This is a dangerous undertaking,” meaning you might get hurt. “Do you have a backup p lan if anything goes wrong?” he asks Sandy. A “backup (backup) plan” is what you will do if your first plan doesn’t work. We might call it an “alternative ” to the plan that you have now.

For example, I want to go to a restaurant that is a bout 15 miles from my house. To get to the restaurant, I have to take the freewa y. I decide to go to this restaurant, but when I get on the freeway, it’s ver y crowded. There’s a lot of what we would call “traffic” – too many cars, making eve ryone move very slowly. So, I decide, “No, this is a bad idea.” I have a backup p lan, however. My backup plan is to go to a different restaurant that’s only one mile from my house and is easy to get to. Because there were problems in trying to  carry out my first plan, I decided to go to my backup plan.

Sandy says, about the plan that she has, “It’ll wor k,” meaning it will work. She says, “I’ve come up with contingencies for every po ssible setback.” “To come up with” something is a phrasal verb meaning to have i nvented or created or thought of something. “Contingencies” (contingencies) are t hings that might happen. They won’t all happen, probably, but some of these things might happen. This word “contingency” is often used when talking about  a plan, especially a formal plan, such as in your business.

You have a plan, but you also think there might be some problems in the future, so you have different possibilities that might happ en: if this happens, then we’re going to do this; if something else happens, then w e’re going to do that. So, you have all sorts of contingencies – things that might  happen that you are prepared for. Sandy says she’s come up with “contingencies” – things that they can do for every possible setback. A “setback” (setback) is wh en you have a problem with your plan – some difficulty or obstacle that makes it difficult or impossible for you to continue with your original plan.

We often use the term “temporary setback,” meaning it’s a problem now, but it won’t be a problem in the future – it’s just for a short amount of time. Jerome says, “It’s just that I’d like to know we have some  recourse if anything goes wrong.” “Recourse” (recourse) is something you can do when you are in a difficult situation, something that you can do to m ake things better. This is a somewhat formal word. “To have recourse to” somethi ng is to have the possibility of using something in order to help you if you have  a problem.

If you wake up in the morning and your car has been  stolen and you need to get to work, your only recourse might be taking a bus. That would be your recourse – what would help you, in this difficult situation, t o do what you need to do. Sandy says, “My plan is foolproof.” “Foolproof” means tha t it cannot possibly fail. There is no possibility of anything going wrong.

She says, “Failure is not an option.” That expressi on, “failure is not an option,” is used to emphasize that you have to succeed – you mu st be successful. You cannot possibly not be successful. If you are, then  terrible things will happen. “Failure is not an option” means we must succeed. O f course, just because you want to succeed doesn’t mean you will succeed. Jero me says, “But don’t you think we should consider some alternatives?” An “al ternative” is another possible way of doing something. Jerome is asking Sandy to t hink about what they are going to do if something goes wrong.

He says, “If, God forbid, anything goes wrong, it w ould be good to have an escape hatch, don’t you think? The phrase “God forb id” (forbid) is used to emphasize that you don’t want something to happen, and you hope that God will prevent it from happening, but it might happen. It’ s an expression that we use when we are saying, “Well, I really don’t want this  to happen. I hope this doesn’t happen, but we have to be prepared if it does happe n.” And that’s what Jerome is saying here. If the plan fails, they need to hav e alternatives. They need to have an escape hatch.

An “escape (escape) hatch (hatch)” refers to a door  that would allow you to escape or get out of something such as an airplane or some sort of space vehicle in an emergency. If you need to get out of whatever  you are in immediately because there’s some problem, you might use an esca pe hatch. This is a way of getting out of a plane or a spacecraft very quickly  in case something goes wrong. However, here it is used not literally to mean a do or, but rather an alternative or a plan that will allow you to get out of a difficult situation if your original plan doesn’t succeed.

Sandy says, “That won’t be necessary.” They will no t need an escape hatch, Sandy is saying. “If anything goes wrong, it’s ever y man for himself.” That expression, “every man for himself,” is used to sho w that each person is responsible for his own future and cannot depend on  other people to help him. If there is a problem with a plan and it looks like ev eryone may be hurt or may be in danger, then each person has to save himself, basic ally, is what this means. “Every man for himself” means I’m not going to help  you; you have to get out of this difficult situation yourself. Jerome says, “Wh at?! I thought we were in this together?” “To be in this together” means to be wor king as part of a team.

Jerome says, “What happened to, ‘stick with me, and  you can’t go wrong?’” “What happened to” is a way of saying, “What about the idea you told me before?” or “Is this still true?” And it’s followed  by, usually, something the other person said that he doesn’t seem to believe anymore . “What happened to, ‘stick with me, and you can’t go wrong?’” “To stick with” someone means to stay close to someone, to follow someone’s example, or to lite rally be with someone during the entire plan or during the entire action that yo u’re doing together. It’s sometimes used to mean, simply, follow what I do; d o what I do; learn from me.

Sandy told Jerome, “Stick with me, and you can’t go  wrong.” The phrase “can’t go wrong” means that everything will be fine. There  will be no problems. Sandy says, “That was before I realized what a liability you are.” A “liability” (liability) is something – or, in this case, someone – representin g a disadvantage. If you say this person is a “liability,” you mean this person will cause us problems or this person might prevent us from being successful at do ing what we want to do. Jerome says, “A liability?!” He’s surprised that Sa ndy thinks that he is a problem.

Sandy says, “In a dangerous plan like this, there a re bound to be some casualties – a sacrificial lamb or two.” “Bound (bo und) to be” means that there will definitely be. It is certain. “Casualties” (ca sualties) are usually people who die or who are hurt in a war or some sort of accident. “Sacrificial lamb” refers to something that needs to be destroyed or something t hat needs to be killed in order for you to succeed at your plan. Of course, t he thing or person killed isn’t usually very happy about that. The term “sacrificia l lamb” comes from the very ancient, old practice of sacrificing, or killing, a n animal to honor God or to honor some divine power.

Jerome says, “Yes, but I didn’t know you’d double-c ross me before we even got started.” So, Sandy is saying that in every dangero us plan, some people will probably get hurt, but that it’s necessary that tha t happen in order for the plan to be successful sometimes. Jerome says yes, he unders tands that. However, he didn’t realize that Sandy would double-cross him be fore they even got started.

 “To double-cross” means to trick or betray someone – to do something that would lose the trust of another person. “To double- cross” means to say, “Oh, yes, I’ll do that,” and then, the very next moment, to d o the opposite. The term “to double-cross” can also be used to describe the act of cheating another person.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
