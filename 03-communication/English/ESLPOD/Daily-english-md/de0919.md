This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 919 – or backwards: 919. 

This episode, like all of our episodes, has a Learn ing Guide. You can find that 8- to 10-page guide on our website at ESLPod.com. You can download that guide if you become a member of ESL Podcast, which I hope yo u will.  

This episode is a dialogue between Adam and Noelle about trying to find a place where they can put their young child while the two of them work. Let's get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Adam: What’s that? 

Noelle: It’s a list of questions I’m going to ask a t the childcare center when we visit today. I want to be prepared.  

Adam: We already know that it’s licensed and has a good reputation. What other questions are you going to ask? 

Noelle: Lots. For instance, I want to know what the  ratio is of children to each childcare worker and what their staff turnover rate  is. 

Adam: Okay, I guess those are important questions. 

Noelle: And I want to know what their policies are on disciplining the kids and what kinds of meals and snacks they serve. 

Adam: Also good questions. 

Noelle: And I want to find out their policies on si ck kids and if they allow late pick- up.  

Adam: Yeah, I guess those are really good questions , too. 

Noelle: And I want to know if I can observe any tim e I want to and if there is a secure check-in/check-out system.  

 Adam: Those are all good questions, but I guess I s houldn’t be surprised that you’ve done your homework.  

Noelle: That’s why you married me, right? Because I ’m so practical? 

Adam: If that’s why I married you, wouldn’t that ma ke me  the practical one?

Our dialogue begins with Adam asking Noelle, “What' s that?” Noelle says, “It's a list of questions I'm going to ask at the childcare  center when we visit today.” A “childcare center” is a place – not a school, but a nother place – that takes care of young children, children who are too young to be in  school, usually under the age of five. So, a young baby or a one-year-old, or two -year-old, or three-year-old, or four-year-old – all of these would be the kind of c hildren you would find in a childcare center, typically.  

Traditionally, women always stayed home and took ca re of the children while the man went out to work. Over the last 50 years, and i n many western nations in particular, there has been a change in the economy.  So, now a lot more women work. Some of these women, if they have a lot of mo ney, can hire someone, can get someone to come in and take care of their child ren at their home – what we might call a “nanny” (nanny). This is one woman who  comes – typically it is a woman – who comes and takes care of children while the wife is working or somewhere else. This only happens, however, if you have a lot of money.  

Instead, what most people do is, if the mother or f ather cannot stay home to take care of the child, they put the child in what's cal led a “childcare center.” A childcare center is a place where, usually, there a re several adults and lots of young children. It's sort of like a school, but usu ally they're not there to teach your children. They're just there to take care of t hem while you are at work.  

Noelle has a list of questions she wants to ask the  people who work at the childcare center. Obviously, she and Adam are looki ng for somewhere where they can take their young child. Adam says, “We alr eady know that it's licensed and has a good reputation.” Adam is referring to on e specific childcare center that apparently Adam and Noelle are interested in. He says that this is a “licensed” facility, or a “licensed” childcare cent er. “Licensed” means it has official permission from the government to be a childcare ce nter. In many places, you must get permission if you want to open up a place like this that will take care of children. Adam also says the childcare center “has a good reputation.” A  

“reputation” is what other people think of you. So,  if it has a “good reputation,” many people think this is a good place.  

Adam says, “What other questions are you going to a sk?” Noelle says, “Lots,” meaning I have a lot of questions. I have many ques tions. “For instance” – for example – “I want to know what the ratio is of chil dren to each childcare worker.” A “ratio” is the same as a proportion. It's how muc h you have of one thing compared to another thing. If you have a ratio of 1 0 children to 1 adult, that means you have 1 adult taking care of 10 children. The ratio is 10 to 1 – we would say, “10 to (to) 1.” Noelle wants to know the  ratio of children to childcare workers.  

She also wants to know what the “staff turnover rat e is.” “Staff” (staff) refers to the employees – the people who work at any company,  including a childcare center. “Turnover” (turnover) – one word – refers t o people quitting their jobs and getting new jobs. When a company has a high turnove r, it has a lot of people who come and go. People are always leaving and they ’re always bringing new people in. We might refer, then, to the “turnover r ate” – the percentage of people who are replaced every month or every year.  

Adam says, “Okay, I guess those are important quest ions.” Noelle says, “And I want to know what their policies are on disciplinin g the kids and what kinds of meals and snacks they serve.” A “policy” (policy) i s a set of rules or regulations – what you do in certain circumstances, certain situa tions. Noelle wants to know “what their policies are on disciplining the kids.”  “To discipline” (discipline) means to do something to someone who is making a mistake or who has done something wrong – usually you try to do something s o that the person doesn't do it again. That is “to discipline,” to provide some sort of negative consequence for someone's negative actions. You're trying to correc t what they are doing and make sure they don't do it again.  

People have different ideas about how to discipline  children. Some people think you should yell at them. Some people think you shou ld lock them in a room by themselves. My neighbors apparently don't believe i n any discipline for their children. So, everyone has a different idea about h ow you should discipline your child.  

Noelle wants to know, also, something about the foo d that they give the children. She wants to know the “kinds of meals and snacks th ey serve.” A “snack” (snack) is a small amount of food that you might eat in bet ween meals. So, you have breakfast in the morning, and then maybe at ten o'c lock in the morning you have a snack. You have an apple, or a doughnut, or an or ange, and then you have  

your lunch, which is a meal. Then in the afternoon you might have another snack, another piece of food, and so forth.  

Children are often given little snacks in between t heir meals, and that's what Noelle is referring to. She wants to know what kind  of snacks they serve. Notice the verb “to serve” means to give someone food. Ada m says that these are good questions. Noelle continues, however – she has even  more questions.  

She says, “I want to find out their policies on sic k kids and if they allow late pickup.” “Sick kids” would be kids who are ill, kid s who have some medical problem. They might have a cold or the flu, for exa mple. Noelle wants to know what their policy is on sick kids. She wants to kno w, probably, whether you can bring a sick child to the childcare center. Some ch ildcare centers do not allow you to do that because, of course, then all of the other children will get sick. 

Noelle also wants to know about “late pickup.” “Pic kup” is when the parent comes to get the child at the end of the day. A “late pic kup” would be the ability to get your child at a time later than normal. So, normall y if parents come at five o'clock, but you can't be there until seven o'clock, you wou ld have a “late pickup.” It would be later than everyone else. Adam says, “Yeah , I guess those are really good questions, too.” Noelle continues, “And I want  to know if I can observe any time I want to.” “To observe” means to watch what i s happening. Noelle is probably referring here to the ability for the pare nt to just come in and to watch to see how the childcare workers are taking care of th eir children.  

Noelle says she wants to know if there is “a secure  check-in/check-out system.” In order to make sure that the children are safe, m ost childcare centers will have some sort of system where they only allow people wh o they know are the parents – or who the parents have sent – to pick up their c hildren. “To check in” is the opposite of “to check out.” “To check in” is when y ou first arrive at a location. We talk about checking into a hotel. When you get ther e, you go to the desk and they give you a key, and you give them money and your na me. “To check out” is when you leave. So, “to check in your children” would be  to bring them to the childcare center, typically in the morning, and then check ou t would be to come at the end of the day and pick them up. “Secure” (secure) here  just means safe.  

Adam says, “Those are all good questions, but I gue ss I shouldn't be surprised that you’ve done your homework.” “Homework” is usua lly what you get in school, what a teacher gives the students to do at home and  to bring back the next day. “To do your homework,” as a general expression, mea ns to do the work required, to do the research, to investigate sufficiently.  

Noelle says, “That's why you married me, right? Bec ause I’m so practical?” Someone who is “practical” is someone who gets thin gs done, who's concerned about the results, who’s very productive. I am the opposite of that. I am very impractical (impractical).  

Adam says, “If that's why I married you, wouldn't t hat make me  the practical one?” Adam is saying, “Well, if I was smart enough to marry you, then I’m the practical one, because I am getting things done by having you do them.” That's probably somewhat true in many marriages.  

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
