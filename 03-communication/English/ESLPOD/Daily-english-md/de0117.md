# Impressions of LA

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 117: Impressions of L.A.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 117. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Dev elopment in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Today we are talking about the general American imp ression of the city of Los Angeles, especially compared to New York City. Let’ s get started!

[start of dialogue]

I was talking to my new friend Nicole about the dif ferences between New York City and Los Angeles. Nicole just relocated from Ne w York, where she lived all her life, and I'm a native of L.A.

Dan: So, is L.A. all it's cracked up to be?

Nicole: Well, the stereotype in the movies is that L.A. is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people. I guess, in the back of my mind, t hat's what I expected.

Dan: And, is it what you found?

Nicole: Well, it is and it's not. The city of L.A. is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected. There are people here from all  over the country and all over world, like New York. I've heard people say that in  L.A., everyone is from somewhere else. That's partly true. So, I've met al l kinds of people here. What I'm realizing is that the picture of L.A. that's in  movies only represents a small segment of the city.

Dan: You're right. Life isn't always like the movie s.

We’re talking today about the city of Los Angeles, where I live, and the impression or the ideas that people have about Los Angeles, especially those who moved from another city – big cities like New Y ork or other cities on the other side of the United States, on the East Coast.  I live here on the West Coast of the U.S and the story begins with the person, the narrator, saying that she was

talking or he was talking to his friend about the d ifferences between New York and Los Angeles. His friend has just relocated from  New York. “To relocate” (relocate) – past tense “relocated” – is to move, t o move permanently here where you’re living from one place to another – usually f rom one city or one state to another. Often, it’s because of a job. So, the comp any you work for asks you to move from Chicago to Dallas – that would be “reloca ting” you.

Well, she had lived or rather been relocated from N ew York – New York City – where she lived all her life – that is all of her l ife – her entire life. And in the story, the narrator is a “native” of Los Angeles or L.A. A  “native” (native) – someone who was born there, someone who is from there origi nally. So the dialogue begins by Dan saying, “So, is L.A. all it’s cracked  up to be?” The expression “cracked up to be” – “cracked (cracked) up to be” –  the verb “to be” – “cracked up to be” here means is it as good as you were expecti ng or as people say it is. So, for example, if you go to a famous museum, say the British Museum in London or any of the beautiful museums in other cities and so meone says, “Well, is it all it’s cracked up to be? – meaning is it as good as people  say it is – and that’s the expression. We sometimes use this in the negative. “It’s not all it’s cracked up to be” – it’s not as good as people say it is. “To cra ck” normally means to break or to separate something – two pieces – into something  rather something into two pieces. But here “cracked up” means is it as good a s people think it is.

Well, Nicole says that the “stereotype” in the movi es about Los Angeles is that it’s a “frivolous” town. The “stereotype” – all one  word – (stereotype) – a “stereotype” is common perception, a common idea th at people have that is often false. So, for example, if you were to say, “Everyo ne from New York City is loud and talks very fast and is rude, is not very nice” – those are all “stereotypes” of people who live in New York City. And there are ste reotypes in every country about people in different regions, about people of different languages, about people with different backgrounds and so forth. Man y of these, of course, are negative stereotypes.

The stereotype about L.A – and it’s usually a negat ive thing- a stereotype – is that it’s “frivolous.” And “frivolous” (frivolous) – when we say something is “frivolous,” we mean not serious. The opposite of i mportant or of serious, something that’s just very light, not important, wo uld be frivolous.

The other stereotype about people in Los Angeles is  that they are “flaky.” “To be flaky” means to be unreliable – means that you’ll s ay one thing and then you’ll do something else. Usually, we talk about people being  “flaky” (flaky) – “flaky” – when they promise to do something, they promise to meet you, for example, at a café and – at the English Café – and they don’t arr ive, they don’t show up, they

don’t come to the café when they said they would – that would be someone who is flaky – the adjective. Or as a noun, we could sa y, “This person is a flake” (flake). “Don’t be a flake,” means keep your promis es. If you say you are going to meet someone, then you should go and be there.

Well, one of the stereotypes about L.A is that peop le here are “flaky.” And Nicole, who’s from New York, says that “in the back of my m ind” that’s what I expected. “In the back of my mind” – that expression means th at you have thought about it, that you have it in your memory, but you weren’t th inking about it actively. You weren’t – it’s something that you may have forgotte n or could only remember a little bit about. Another use of this expression or  another example of this expression would be “I was talking to my friend and  he was telling me about his mother. And in the back of my mind, I was thinking this is the fourth time he has complained to me about his mother,” meaning I start  to remember something that I might have forgotten – “in the back of my mind.”

Well, Nicole says that L.A isn’t exactly what she e xpected. She says that L.A is bigger and “more diverse” or “diverse” than she had  expected. “To be diverse” or “diverse” means – (diverse) – it’s spelled – it mea ns to have a lot of variety. And usually, when we talk about diversity – when someth ing is diverse – we’re talking about people from different backgrounds, from diffe rent, perhaps parts of the country or parts of the world. And here in Los Ange les, Nicole says, we have people from all over the world – just like in New Y ork City. Nicole says that everyone in L.A is from somewhere else and that’s t rue. They’re usually from somewhere else in the world or somewhere else in the United States. People like me, for example. In Los Angeles, I’m sure the major ity of the people who live here now, were not born here. And that is not true in other cities in the United States. Where I’m from, St. Paul, Minnesota, the ca pital of Minnesota. Most of the people you meet will be – have been born in tha t area. So, the smaller towns, the smaller cities tend to be – we would probably c all them more “stable” (stable) – means they don’t change very much – their populat ion. The people don’t move in and out. But in Los Angeles – has a very diverse  and mixed population from all over.

Nicole uses the expression “that’s partly true.” Wh en someone says, it’s “partly (partly) true” or it’s partly false, they mean it’s  sort of – not completely. “Partly” is not completely, not totally. So, “it’s partly true”  means there’s some truth, but it’s not all true.

She says that she’s met all kinds of people here. W hen you say “all kinds” you mean “many different types of people.” And she ends  by saying that her “picture of L.A” – the picture that’s in the movies only rep resents a small segment of the

city. When we use the expression “the picture” – “T he picture you get is that people are flaky” – you mean the impression, the id ea that you get. We sometimes refer to movies as pictures but here, eve n though we’re talking about a movie, the expression “the picture” – that noun –  the use of that noun here is not necessarily related to the movie. You can say, for example, “The picture that you get of London by reading Charles Dickens” – fam ous English author – “is a very dark and depressing one.” So, you can get a pi cture, an idea, of something from any sort of source of information – a movie, a  book, a conversation, television show, and so forth.

Well, the picture that Nicole has of L.A is – that she’s seen in the movies, only “represents” – means it only shows you a small segm ent of the city. A “segment” (segment) is a small part of the city.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
