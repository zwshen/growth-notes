This episode is called “Eating Spoiled Food.”  “Spoiled  food” is food that is no longer good to eat.  We’ll listen to a dialogue betw een Ryan and Corrie using a lot of vocabulary that you might see or hear describing spo iled food.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ryan:  It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me.  It ’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked meal.

Corrie:  I’m happy to do it.  First, though, let’s see  what you have in your fridge.

Ryan:  I have tons of food in there.

Corrie:  What is that?  It looks moldy.

Ryan:  Oh, that’s cheese.  I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts.

Corrie:  Okay, but look at the “best if used by” date.  This expired three months ago.  What about this?

Ryan:  That’s hamburger.  Maybe you could make some spaghet ti with meatballs.

Corrie:  Not with this rotten meat.  It’s definitely g one bad.  Can’t you tell by the discoloration?  Meat isn’t supposed to be gray.

Ryan:  I guess you’re right.  I bet this milk isn’t any go od either, is it?

 Corrie:  Nope.  It’s gone sour, and you might as well t hrow out this bread, too. It’s stale.

Ryan:  Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?

Corrie:  Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks tai nted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted.  You do have a lo t of food in your kitchen, but it’s been here a long, long time.

Ryan:  I don’t like things to go to waste.

Corrie:  I guess not.  I’m still willing to make you d inner, but we’ll have to do some shopping.  My cooking isn’t the best, but I don’t usually g ive people food poisoning, and I don’t want to start now.

Ryan:  Okay, okay, give me a list and I’ll go to the marke t.

Corrie:  And while you’re there, I’ll see what I can d o about getting rid of all of this hazardous waste!

Ryan begins our dialogue by saying, “It’s really nice of yo u to make dinner for me.  It’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked m eal.”  A “home-cooked meal” would be, of course, one that you make yourself in  your house.  Corrie says, “I’m happy to do it.  First, though, let’s see what  you have in your fridge.” So, Corrie is over at Ryan’s apartment or house and she is agreeing to cook a meal for him, so she looks inside of his fridge.  “Fridg e” is short for refrigerator; it’s a box that keeps cold where you store or put your food .  Ryan says, “I have tons of food in there.”  Notice we say “tons of food,” it’s very common for informal English to use this idea of “tons,” meaning a lot.  A “ ton,” of course, is 2,000 pounds, but here it just means a lot of food.

Corrie then asks, “What is that?  It looks moldy.”  “Moldy”  (moldy) comes from the word “mold,” which are small green plants, really, tha t grow on things usually because they are old or wet, especially food.  Ryan says, “Oh , that’s cheese.  I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts. ”  Corrie says, “Okay, but look at the ‘best if used by’ date.”  Most food, especially fr esh food that you would put in your refrigerator for example, has a date on it aft er which you shouldn’t probably eat it.  That’s what Corrie means by the “best if used by” date, meaning this food should be used by a certain date.  “This expired  three months ago,” she

 says.  “To expire” means something has passed its time; it is no longer able to be used.  In this case, it’s for food that is too old to be eaten; it’s no longer good.

Then Corrie says, “What about this?” pointing to somethi ng else.  Ryan says, “That’s hamburger.  Maybe you could make some spaghetti  with meatballs.” Corrie says, “Not with this rotten meat.”  “Rotten” (ro tten) comes from the verb “to rot” (rot), which means to spoil, to decay so that you can ’t use it anymore.  Rotten meat would be meat that is no longer good to eat beca use it is too old.  Corrie says that the hamburger has definitely gone bad.  “To go  bad” means to become rotten, to become spoiled, to become so that you can no longer eat it.  “To go” has, of course, hundreds of meanings in English; take a l ook at our Learning Guide for just a few more of those.

Corrie then says, “Can’t you tell by the discoloration?  M eat isn’t supposed to be gray.”  “Discoloration” is when something changes its color,  usually to indicate that there is a problem or that it has gone bad.  Ryan  says, “I guess you’re right. I bet this milk isn’t any good either, is it?”  Corrie sa ys, “Nope,” an informal way of saying no – “nope” (nope).  “It’s gone sour.”  “To be so ur” means to have spoiled, to have an unpleasant taste or smell, especially if we are talking about milk or something made from milk.  Corrie says, “you might as well  throw out this bread, too.  It’s stale.”  The expression “you might as well” is u sed to suggest that someone do something or to indicate what you should do.  “Stale” (stale) is the opposite of “fresh.”  When we’re talking about bread, stale bread would be dry and old, fresh bread would be soft and moist.  Ryan th en says, “Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?” meaning isn’t any of my food any good. This is the problem if you walk into my kitchen, I don’t have a lot that you could eat!

Corrie says, “Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks ta inted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted.”  There a re several words there that we use to describe particular kinds of food or thin gs that you eat that go bad. Let’s start with the first one about the oil.  Corrie says, “this oil (such as vegetable oil or olive oil) is rancid.”  We use “rancid” (rancid) sp ecifically to talk about oil or fat or food that has fat in it that goes bad – that spoils.  It usually will have a bad smell and a bad taste.  Corrie also says that the butte r looks “tainted.”  You could also use the adjective “rancid” when talking about butter .  But Corrie, here, is saying that the butter is “tainted.”  Here, she means th at it is not safe to eat; it is perhaps something that could even hurt you.  She says, “t he vegetables are wilted.”  “Wilted” is when a vegetable that is normall y stiff and crisp (that is, it normally is sort of hard) becomes very soft and the leaves of  it are weak.  For example if you have lettuce, which is a green food that y ou use in salads, if the lettuce is put in the heat the leaves of the lettuce – the pieces of lettuce will wilt

 (wilt).  So she says the vegetables are “wilted,” meanin g they are no longer fresh. She also says that Ryan’s canned goods are “rusted.”  “Canne d” means it is food that you buy in a can that you then open.  “Canned goo ds” could include things like tomato sauce or corn; many different kinds of food can be purchased in a can.  But these canned goods – these canned foods are ru sted.  The actual can is made of metal, and the metal, if it is very old, can  turn brown creating something we call “rust.”  Well, you don’t want to eat  canned food that comes from the cans that are rusted, there could be something  there that could make you sick.

Corrie says, “You do have a lot of food in your kitchen, b ut it’s been here a long, long time.”  Ryan says, “I don’t like things to go to wast e.”  The expression “to go to waste” means that you don’t use it; not using somethi ng that you paid money for.  But of course, if you wait too long, well, the food will no longer be able to be eaten.  Corrie says, “I guess not,” meaning I guess you do n’t like to waste things. That’s obvious by the fact that he didn’t throw anything away.  Corrie says, “I’m still willing to make your dinner, but we’ll have to do  some shopping.  My cooking isn’t the best, but I don’t usually give people food poi soning.  “Food poisoning” is when you get very sick because of something that you have eate n.  I had food poisoning about 10 years ago, where I had to go to the  hospital because I was so sick.  I won’t tell you where I ate, although the restau rant is still here in Los Angeles.  So if you come to Los Angeles I’ll tell you whi ch restaurant you should not eat at!

Anyway, Corrie says that she needs to buy some new food so that she can prepare the meal – some fresh food.  Ryan says, “Okay, okay , give me a list and I’ll go to the market,” place where they sell, in th is case, food.  Corrie says, “And while you’re there, I’ll see what I can do about getti ng rid of all of this hazardous waste!”  “To get rid of” means to throw out.  The ter m “hazardous waste” is usually one that we apply to chemicals that are very danger ous.  Corrie is making a joke here; she’s saying that the food is old and so spoi led that it is like a hazardous waste.  “Hazardous” comes from the word “hazard, ” meaning something that could cause you harm, something that is da ngerous.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
