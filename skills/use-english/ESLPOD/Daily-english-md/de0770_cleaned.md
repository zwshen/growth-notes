This episode is called “Joining a Tour.”  We’re goi ng to be taking a trip – a vacation, and we’re going to be going with a group of other people.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Darrel:  What are you looking at? 

Alice:  Tours for our vacation.  I was thinking tha t it’d be hard for us to get around on our own, so I think joining a tour is a good ide a. 

Darrel:  Really?  I thought we’d make our way aroun d leisurely to see the sites.  I don’t like the fast pace of tours.  I’d rather have  the time to take in each site, not rush through it just to say I’ve been there. 

Alice:  Tours come in all shapes and sizes.  I’m su re we can find one that isn’t too fast-paced or strenuous for you. 

Darrel:  And I don’t want to eat all my meals with the tour group.  I want some time to explore on our own. 

Alice:  All right, I’m looking at a tour that has t he perfect itinerary.  It’s also gotten rave reviews.  It includes a tour guide, all admiss ion fees, accommodations, ground transportation, and most of the meals.  And there are several free mornings and afternoons built-in so we can explore on our own. 

Darrel:  I don’t know.   

Alice:  The alternative is for you to plan each sto p of our trip. 

Darrel:  A tour is sounding better and better.

Darrel begins by saying to Alice, “What are you loo king at?”  Alice says, “Tours for our vacation.”  A “tour” (tour) is an organized  journey to see a city or a place, usually it’s with a group of people, and there is s omeone leading the tour called the “tour guide.”  Alice is looking for tours for h er and Darrel’s vacation.  She says, “I was thinking that it’d be hard for us to g et around on our own,” meaning it would be difficult for us to go to this place, wher ever they’re going, by themselves, “so I think joining a tour is a good id ea,” signing up, paying and becoming a member of this group that will travel to gether. 

Darrel says, “Really?  I thought we’d make our way around leisurely to see the sites.”  “To make our way around” means to go by yo urself, not with another group, to find out the interesting things, to look at things by yourself; you don’t have anyone helping you.  “Leisurely” (leisurely) i s an adverb meaning slowly, in a very calm and relaxed, enjoyable way.  The “sites ” (sites) are places that you go to visit: it could be a famous building, it coul d be a beautiful park, it might to be a museum, anything that you would go as a tourist –  as someone visiting another place – to see.  That would be called a “site.”  Da rrel says he doesn’t like the fast pace of tours.  The “pace” (pace) is the speed, how  fast or how slow something goes.  I can talk at a fast pace or I can talk at a  slow pace.  I can walk at a fast pace or walk at a slow pace.  Darrel says, “I’d rat her have the time to take in each site, not rush through it just to say I’ve bee n there.”  “To take in” means to look at, to experience, to appreciate something.  I f you come to Los Angeles I would tell you to go and drive up along the ocean a nd take in the beautiful views – the beautiful scenery, the things that you can se e: the ocean and so forth.  Well Darrel says he wants time to take in each site – ea ch place they visit, not rush through it just to say he’s been there.  “To rush t hrough (something)” is to do something very quickly, usually without enough time  to do it well.  He doesn’t want to go from one place to another place just to say that he was at those places, he wants to actually stop and enjoy them. 

Alice says, “Tours come in all shapes and sizes.”  The expression “to come in all shapes and sizes” means that there is a wide variet y of options, a lot of different types, a lot of different ways that tours can be or ganized; they’re not all the same. Alice says, “I’m sure we can find one that isn’t (t hat is not) too fast-paced or strenuous for you.”  When we say is something is “s trenuous” (strenuous) we mean it’s difficult, it requires a lot of perhaps p hysical work or mental concentration.  It’s a lot of work.  Usually it’s u sed when we talk about physical  

work, like lifting heavy boxes for example.  Alice thinks she can find a tour that isn’t too strenuous for Darrel. 

Darrel says, “And I don’t want to eat all my meals with the tour group.”  Your “meals” are your breakfast, your lunch, and your di nner.  It’s often the case that on a tour you go to a restaurant and everyone eats together.  Darrel doesn’t want to do that; he says, “I want some time to explore o n our own.”  “To explore” means to go to someplace you’ve never been before t o try to learn new things, to discover new things.  Darrel says he wants to explo re.  Alice says, “All right, I’m looking at a tour that has the perfect itinerary.”  “Itinerary” is a planned scheduled for a trip.  It shows exactly what you are going to  be doing: first you get up at 8:00, then you eat breakfast, your bus leaves at 11 :00, you arrive at the museum at 1:00, and so on.  That’s an itinerary.  Alice sa ys this tour has gotten, or has received, rave reviews.  “Rave reviews” are when pe ople say that something is very wonderful; it’s excellent.  You may, for examp le, be thinking of going to a restaurant, so you go online and you look at the re views, what other people say about that restaurant.  If they are saying they’re wonderful, then we say they are “rave (rave) reviews.”  “Rave” has a couple of diff erent meanings in English, however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some  of those.   

Alice says that this tour she found includes a tour  guide (remember that’s the person who is the leader of the tour), all admissio n fees, accommodations, ground transportation, and most of our meals.  An “ admission fee” is the amount of money that you pay to get into a museum or to ge t into some famous historical site.  The word “fee” (fee) is price.  “Admission” is to get into something, to enter into something, or to become part of something.  “A ccommodations” is another word for the place where you are going to sleep at night; we sometimes called this “lodging” (lodging).  “Lodging” and “accommoda tions” mean the same thing, it’s your hotel or whatever place you are staying a t and sleeping at.  “Ground transportation” refers to how you get from one plac e to another by car, bus, train, subway, anything that travels on the ground.  It do es not include air travel; we’re not talking about airplanes.  But, we’re talking ab out all the other ways that you can travel without leaving the ground. 

Alice says, “there are several free mornings,” mean ing mornings that you don’t have anything planned, that you can do what you wan t, “and afternoons.”  These free mornings and afternoons are built-in so they c an explore on their own. When we say something is “built-in” we mean it’s in cluded as part of the plan – as part of the itinerary.  “We are planning that on  the second day in the afternoon we won’t have any activities, you can do whatever y ou want.”  That’s why Alice says they are built-in; they are part of the plan. 

Darrel is not sure; he says, “I don’t know.”  Alice  says, “The alternative is for you to plan each stop of our trip.”  The “alternative” means the other option or another way we can do this.  She says the alternative is fo r Darrel to plan each stop – each day, each thing you do each day – for their tr ip.  Darrel says, “A tour is sounding better and better.”  Now that he has the o ption of doing everything himself or taking a tour, now he’s more interested in taking the tour! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal pace.
