This episode is about someone who is going through customs. When you go into another country, the government officials of that c ountry often want to look to see what you are bringing into the country. Let’s get s tarted.

The topic of this episode is “going through customs ” (customs). “Customs” refers to the office, or the people who work for the offic e, of the government that check the things that you are bringing into a country. So , when you go from one country to another and you have a suitcase – you have lugga ge with clothing and other things in it – the customs official wants to make s ure that you’re not bringing anything into the country you’re not supposed to. M ost countries have two people or two offices that handle new arrivals to the coun try, either at an airport or somewhere else. That would be “immigration and cust oms.” “Immigration” checks to make sure that you have the legal right t o come into the country, and “customs” checks to make sure you’re not bringing a nything that you shouldn’t bring into the country.  

Our dialogue begins, then, with a customs officer. “Officer” here just means employee – person who works for the customs office.  The customs officer says, “Your passports, please.” Your “passport” is the of ficial government document from your government that allows you to travel to o ther countries. In the U.S. you typically have to show your passport to an immigrat ion official and then later to a customs official, because it’s your official identi fication.  

Customs officers will often ask you what your final  destination is. So, if you fly to Boston, but you are only going to arrive in Boston and stay there for a few hours, and then you’re going to drive down to New York Cit y, you would say your final destination is New York City. That’s where you are going to go. That’s the place you’re really going to go. You’re just here in Bost on to rent a car and drive down to New York City. That’s what the customs officer i s asking Özkan. 

Özkan says, “Los Angeles.” That’s his final destina tion. The customs officer says, “How long is your stay?” Your “stay” is the period of time when you’re going to be in a certain place. “How long are you going to rema in in Los Angeles?” Özkan says, “We’ll be there for a week.” The customs offi cer says, “What is the purpose of your trip?” Why are you coming? Usually they wan t to know if you’re there for  

business or if you’re there for pleasure – that is,  just for fun. Özkan says, “I’m going there on business.” So, his reason, his purpo se, is for something related to his job.  

He says, “My family is accompanying me on vacation. ” To “accompany” someone is to go with someone else. The other perso n needs to go somewhere, and you decide to go with them, perhaps “to keep th em company,” we might say. That is, to be their friend, to have someone for th em to talk to. That would be an example of accompanying someone.  

In this case, the family is accompanying Özkan on v acation. “On vacation” means they’re there for pleasure. They’re there jus t to have fun, to relax. The customs officer says, “Who are you travelling with? ” Özkan answers, “This is my wife, Ayse, and these are my children, Mustafa and Omer.” The customs officer says, “Are you bringing in any restricted items?” A n “item” (item) is just a thing – something. A “restricted item” is something that yo u are not supposed to bring into that country or that, if you bring it into tha t country, you need special permission, or you might even have to pay money, li ke a tax, to bring it into the country. That would be a “restricted item.”  

The customs officer then lists, or gives examples o f, restricted items – plants, fruits and vegetables, meats, or animals. In some c ountries, they don’t allow you to bring in plants, for example, because they’re af raid that they may be plants that have diseases, or have bugs, or have things th at might hurt the plants in that country. Özkan says, “No.” No, I don’t have any of these restricted items.  

The customs officer says then, “Do you have anythin g to declare?” “To declare” (declare) means to make an official statement. In t his case, it means to tell the customs officer that you have something that you wa nt to bring in the country but that you will probably have to pay tax on or that y ou think the customs officer might want to know that you’re bringing it in.  

So, for example, if you’re bringing in a lot of cig arettes, or if you’re bringing in alcohol, you might have to declare that at customs.  You might have to say, “Yes, I am bringing in a bottle of alcohol,” and tell tha t to the customs officer. You might have to pay some sort of tax, however, if you do th at. But, you do not want to go through customs and not declare things you’re suppo sed to, because then, if they search you and they find those things in your luggage, in your suitcase, you could get into more trouble. They, in fact, could n ot allow you to come into the country, possibly.  

Özkan says, “We bought some duty-free items in the airport. Here’s the receipt.” In many places, you can buy things without having t o pay taxes on them, especially if you are about to leave the country an d you’re not going to remain in that country. If you are from another country, you can sometimes buy things at the airport, or even there on the airplane, that yo u don’t have to pay the local taxes on. That’s what Özkan is talking about. He sa ys, “We bought some duty- free items.” “Duty” (duty) is the tax. It’s another  word for a tax you pay to bring something into a country. “Duty-free” means that it  is not taxable. You don’t have to pay tax on it.  

The customs officer says, “That’s fine. Step over t o the exam station for baggage inspection.” “To step over” means to move over to o ne side, to go to a particular place in a particular direction, usually to the sid e of where you are right now. The customs officer wants the family to step over to th e “exam station.” “Exam” is short for “examination.” The word “station” is some times used to describe one particular place within a larger place where someth ing is done. In this case, it is a place at the airport, usually a big table where the y take your luggage or your baggage and they open it up and they inspect it – t hat is, they look inside of it to see what you are bringing into the country.  

When you come into the United States, you don’t alw ays have to go through baggage inspection. Sometimes it’s just random. The y just pick people who they think may be bringing something – or just because t hey need to show that they’re working – and they inspect the luggage. They look i nside of your luggage to make sure that you are not bringing in anything tha t you should not.  

After the customs officer speaks to Özkan, he says,  “We opened our bags for inspection and luckily,” – fortunately – “the inspe ctor found nothing to confiscate and we got off scot-free.” The “inspector” is the p erson who works for the customs office who looks, who inspects the baggage.  “He found nothing to confiscate.” “To confiscate” (confiscate) means to take something from you because you are, in this case, bringing it in illeg ally. “To confiscate” means to take away something from another person. In this ca se, the inspector did not confiscate anything.  

And so, Özkan says, “We got off scot-free.” “To get  off scot- (scot) free” means not to be punished for something you did wrong. We only use this expression if you’ve done something wrong but you are not punishe d for it. You have no negative consequences for it. That is “to get off s cot-free.” That’s what Özkan says.  

He says, “We got off scot-free. I’m really glad the y didn’t find that cat we’re smuggling in as a gift for my favorite podcaster.” “To smuggle (smuggle) in something” or “to smuggle something in” is a phrasa l verb meaning to bring something in that you are not allowed to – to hide something so that the customs inspector doesn’t see it, because it’s illegal and you don’t want to get caught, or you don’t want to pay the duty, to pay the tax you would have to. This is not, by the way, a very good idea. But Özkan wants to give his favorite podcaster – I don’t know who that is – a cat. I assume it’s not m e. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
