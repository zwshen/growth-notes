    has a beautiful campus. The authority of NGU has decided to take some more 
    steps about beautification of this campus. One of these steps is <b>tree plantation</b> 
    in some roads. To complete this project they will select some roads, and for 
    any road they will also select a number that how many tree will be planted 
    on that road. To make this campus 
    more beautiful they decided in a single road, the gap between any two 
    adjacent tree will be fixed, and this gap will be as large as possible. So If 
    you walk through the road in a constant speed, you will reach a tree after 
    constant intervals.</p>

    <p align="justify">A road can be described by <b>K</b> points <b>P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, 
    ...... , P<sub>K</sub></b>. <b>P<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>P<sub>i+1</sub></b> are connected by a 
    straight line.&nbsp;So, it is clear that a road consists of some contiguous 
    straight lines. <sub>&nbsp;</sub></p>

	<p align="justify">
 In this problem you have to find all the points, where to plant a tree. For the 
 sake of simplicity, we will consider that roads will not have any width. </p>
