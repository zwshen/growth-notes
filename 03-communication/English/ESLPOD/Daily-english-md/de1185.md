This episode is a dialogue between Harry and Christ ina about people who try to bring things or bring people into another country i llegally. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Christina: What is the holdup? There are cars backe d up for half a mile.

Harry: I bet the Border Patrol is looking for smugg lers.

Christina: Do you really think so? I wonder if ther e could be a drug mule in one of these cars carrying illegal drugs.

Harry: It might be drugs, but it could be any kind of contraband. I’ve heard that there’s a problem with gunrunning and other kinds of arms trafficking across these borders.

Christina: Maybe they’re looking for people trying to sneak into this country without permission.

Harry: Or they could be looking for people trying to import exotic species without permission.

Christina: What kinds of exotic species?

Harry: Plants and animals that aren’t allowed to be  brought into this country, at least not without quarantine.

 Christina: Plants? You mean like these herb plants I bought?

Harry: I doubt if they’re prohibited. Wait, you can ’t leave the car!

Christina: What if this is contraband and they catc h me with it?

Harry: They’ll confiscate it and send us on our way .

Christina: Are you sure?

Harry: Sure, I’m sure. They’d be much more interest ed in the bats I’m smuggling in my pants anyway.

Christina: What?!

Christina says to Harry, “What is the holdup? There  are cars backed up for half a mile.” A “holdup” (holdup) is a source of delay, so mething that slows you down, something that puts you behind schedule. “There’s a  holdup in the front of the line because someone is having a problem with his c redit card.” So the line isn’t moving. Nothing is going forward. A “holdup” is a r eason for something that isn’t happening that should be happening.

I should mention, there’s a very different meaning of “holdup,” which is when people go into a store or a bank and try to get the  money from the store or bank with a gun or some other sort of weapon. That is, i f someone tries to steal money by going into the business, usually with some sort of weapon. It doesn’t even have to be a business. It could be a car or somewhe re else. Here, we’re just talking about a delay.

Christina says, “There are cars backed up for half a mile.” “To be backed (backed) up” means that you have a lot of cars that  are stopped or moving very slowly instead of going at the normal speed on that  particular road or freeway. There are backed-up cars on the freeways of Los Ang eles every day of the week. Harry says, “I bet the Border Patrol is looking for  smugglers.”

Now we understand that Christina and Harry appear to be entering into another country. Maybe they went to Canada and are returnin g to the United States. Maybe they went to Mexico and are returning to the United States. The “border” (border) is the line that divides two countries. A “patrol” (patrol) is a group of

police officers, soldiers, or government officials who are usually there to prevent crime or to do some sort of inspection. In the U.S. , the Border Patrol is responsible for preventing people and things from c oming into the United States illegally.

If you drive from Canada or Mexico into the United States, you have to stop at the Border Patrol on the border or right inside of the United States, and you will be asked a bunch of questions and they may look ins ide of your car. This happened to me several times as I came back from Me xico. The Border Patrol is sometimes looking for “smugglers” (smugglers). A “s muggler” is a person who tries to bring things or bring people illegally int o another country.

Christina says, “Do you really think so? I wonder i f there could be a drug mule in one of these cars carrying illegal drugs.” A “drug mule” (mule) is a person who carries illegal drugs from one place to another usu ally by hiding those drugs somewhere on or even in his body. We won’t talk abo ut the places where the drugs may be hidden. “Illegal drugs” are drugs that  are against the law – chemical substances whose sale and or use is agains t the law. Examples would be heroin or cocaine in the United States.

Harry says, “It might be drugs, but it could be any  kind of contraband.” “Contraband” (contraband) is anything that is broug ht into a country illegally. It could be drugs. It could be guns. It could even be electronics or certain kinds of food or cigarettes – anything that is illegal to br ing into another country. Harry continues, “I’ve heard that there’s a problem with gunrunning and other kinds of arms trafficking across these borders.”

“Gunrunning” (gunrunning) is bringing guns and othe r weapons into a country illegally. “Arms” (arms) refers to guns and other w eapons. “Trafficking” (trafficking) is buying and selling things that are  illegal to buy and sell. So “arms trafficking” would be illegally buying and selling guns and other weapons. Sometimes we, sadly, talk about “human trafficking”  – buying and selling of human beings. Such is the world we live in.

Christina says, “Maybe they’re looking for people t rying to sneak into this country without permission.” “To sneak (sneak) into” means to go into somewhere without being seen or observed, usually because you  don’t have permission to go into that place. But it could just be to go into  a place unobserved. Your teenage son may sneak into his room after midnight not wanting you to know that he didn’t get home by the time you told him to be h ome. In this case, we’re talking about people sneaking into a country – goin g into a country without permission and without being seen.

 Harry says, “Or they could be looking for people tr ying to import exotic species without permission.” “To import” (import) means to bring something into another country, usually to sell it in that country. “Speci es” (species) refers to a kind of plant or animal. “Exotic (exotic) species” refers to species that are not normally found in a given area or a given country. They’re f rom another part of the world or another country. Christina then asks, “What kind s of exotic species?” Harry says, “Plants and animals that aren’t allowed to be  brought into this country, at least not without quarantine.”

That’s not a very good definition by Harry of exoti c species. There are plants and animals that you’re not allowed to bring into a cou ntry that are not exotic, meaning that are found normally in that country, bu t for a variety of reasons you’re not allowed to bring them in. This, by the w ay, is also sometimes the case when you go from state to state in the United State s. Normally when you go from one state to another, there is no person there chec king to see if you have certain items that you are bringing into that state, but there are exceptions to that.

Here in California, if you drive into the state of California, you will be stopped by a California officer, a government official, who will  ask if you are bringing in certain kinds of plants or fruits. Because California has a  large agriculture industry – that is, it grows a lot of food – it has to be careful that you’re not bringing in certain diseases with your plants that would affect the pla nts here in California. Hawaii also has a similar system where they may check to make sure you’re not bringing in certain kinds of fruit or plants into the state of Hawaii when you arrive at the airport.

Harry also mentions animals coming into the country  that cannot be brought in “without quarantine” (quarantine). Certain animals can be brought into a country if they are allowed to spend time separated from ot her animals to make sure that they don’t have any illnesses or diseases. Christin a says, “Plants? You mean like these herb plants I bought?” “Herbs” are basically plants whose leaves are used to season or flavor food – things like parsley, sag e, rosemary, and thyme – just like the song. You remember? “Parsley, sage, rosema ry, and thyme.” Simon and Garfunkel, people. Look it up on YouTube.

Anyway, Harry says, “I doubt if they’re prohibited. ” If something is “prohibited” (prohibited), it is not allowed. It is forbidden. H arry then says to Christina, “Wait, you can’t leave the car!” Apparently Christina star ts to get out of the car, probably to get rid of her herb plants that she thinks are p rohibited. Christina says, “What if this,” meaning her herbs, “is contraband and they c atch me with it?” meaning they find her with it.

 Harry says, “They’ll confiscate it and send us on o ur way.” “To confiscate” (confiscate) is to take something from another pers on because you have the legal right to do so. A teacher may confiscate a st udent’s cell phone if he’s using the cell phone in class against the rules of the sc hool. The police may confiscate illegal guns or drugs if they find you with them. “ To send someone on his way” means to simply let someone leave without doing any thing to them, without stopping them – to release someone whom you could h ave kept but decided not to.

In this case, Harry is saying that the people at the border – who in this case would be the customs officials, I think – would con fiscate or take the illegal items but would not arrest them. They would let the peopl e go – in this case, let Christina go. Christina says, “Are you sure?” Harry  says, “Sure, I’m sure,” meaning yes, I’m sure. The officials, Harry says, w ould be much more interested in the bats he is smuggling in his pants.

A “bat” (bat) is a small flying mammal – kind of li ke a mouse with wings that flies at night. You know Batman? Well, Batman is based on  the animal called a “bat.” And apparently Harry has bats in his pants, which s ounds very painful, that he is trying to bring illegally into the country. He’s tr ying to smuggle them into the country. Christina apparently didn’t know that and is quite surprised at the end of the dialogue, as are all of us.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
