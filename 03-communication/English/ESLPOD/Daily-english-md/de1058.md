This episode is a dialogue about people who drink t oo much – too much alcohol, that is. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Danielle: They’re at it again. Those college kids n ext door are having another kegger.

Nabil: That’s what we get for buying a house this c lose to a college. College students will have keggers and they’ll binge drink.  It’s a rite of passage.

Danielle: It’s dangerous to their health and a mena ce to the neighborhood, and I’m going to do something about it.

Nabil: There’s nothing we can do. If it gets out of  hand, we can call the cops, but let’s not overreact.

Danielle: I’m not overreacting. They’re college stu dents, so I’m going to teach them about the dangers of binge drinking.

Nabil: What are you going to do?

Danielle: I’m going to wait on the sidewalk and pas s out flyers as people arrive. This flyer lists the many health reasons they shoul d moderate their drinking. It’s for their own good.

Nabil: And you think college students are going to give you the time of day?

Danielle: I won’t let them pass unless they agree to drink responsibly.

 Nabil: I have a feeling we’ll see the cops tonight.

Danielle: You think the party will get out of hand?

Nabil: No, I think they’ll be here to arrest the cr azy lady waylaying people outside of their house!

Our dialogue begins with Danielle saying to Nabil, “They’re at it again.” “To be at something again” means to be doing something again,  especially when we are referring to something that we don’t like. If you h ear your neighbors arguing with each other, you might say, “They’re at it again.” T hey’re arguing again. They’re doing something you don’t like again. In this case,  the problem is not people arguing, but college students drinking.

Danielle says, “Those college students next door,” meaning next to the house where we live, “are having another kegger.” A “kegg er” (kegger) is a party that has a lot of people and a lot of beer. The beer com es in a big barrel, a big container called a “keg” (keg). So, it’s very popul ar, especially among college students, to have parties where someone brings a bi g keg – a big barrel, basically – of beer. These parties are called “kegg ers.” Remember, in the U.S., the drinking age is 21 years old. However, this doe sn’t stop people under 21 from drinking, especially at parties such as keggers.

Nabil says, “That’s what we get for buying a house this close to a college.” “That’s what we get” means that is the logical nega tive consequence of something. If someone says to you, “You put on twen ty pounds” – you’ve gained twenty pounds – “That’s what you get for eating all  of that chocolate,” the idea is that the logical consequence of eating all of that chocolate is that you gain weight. The logical consequence of moving into a ho use that is close to a college or university is that you get student parties.

“College students,” Nabil continues, “will have keg gers and they’ll binge drink. It’s a rite of passage.” “To binge (binge) on” something  means to consume a lot of it. “To binge drink” would be to drink a lot of alcohol  in a short amount of time. “To binge watch” would be to watch a lot of television in a short amount of time. That expression “to binge watch” has become popular in the last few years to refer to people who like to watch all of the episodes of a c ertain television series in a short amount of time, say over a single weekend.

“Rite (rite) of passage (passage)” refers to an eve nt or an activity that marks or indicates your movement or transition from one stag e to another. A rite of passage would be something that everyone goes throu gh at a certain age that indicates that they are growing older or that they are changing. Nabil is saying that having keggers is a rite of passage for colleg e students; it’s something that all college students do. Danielle says, however, “I t’s dangerous to their health and a menace to the neighborhood, and I’m going to do something about it.”

Danielle says that the binge drinking of her colleg e neighbors is a “menace” (menace) to the neighborhood. A menace is something  that is dangerous, scary, or threatening. There was an old television show ca lled “Dennis the Menace.” Dennis was a young child who was always getting int o trouble. Usually, however, “menace” has a little more negative meaning than ju st the trouble that a young boy would get into. When you say something is “mena cing,” you mean that it is threatening you in a very dangerous way.

Danielle thinks that the binge drinking of her coll ege neighbors is a menace to the neighborhood, and she’s going to “do something about it,” meaning she’s going to somehow try to stop it or change it. Nabil  says, “There is nothing we can do. If it gets out of hand, we can call the cops, b ut let’s not overreact.” When something “gets out of hand” (hand), it gets out of  control. It becomes too wild for anyone to control it and to limit the damage it mig ht cause.

If the party gets out of control, Nabil says they can call the cops. The “cops” (cops) are the police. The word “cop” is used infor mally to refer to a police officer. “Let’s not overreact,” Nabil says, however. “To ove rreact” (overreact) means to react to something too strongly – to act as if some thing is more important than it really is, especially when you are reacting in a ne gative way.

If your wife tells you that you need to wash the di shes tonight after dinner, and you start yelling and screaming about how you’re to o busy, that would be overreacting. That would be reacting in a negative way that the situation doesn’t require or doesn’t seem appropriate for. Danielle s ays, “I’m not overreacting. They’re college students, so I’m going to teach the m about the dangers of binge drinking.” Nabil says, “What are you going to do?” Danielle says, “I’m going to wait on the sidewalk and pass out flyers as people arrive.”

The “sidewalk” is a narrow area along the side of the road or the street where people walk up and down instead of walking in the s treet. Danielle is going to stand on the sidewalk near the house and pass out f lyers. “To pass out” is a two- word phrasal verb that here means to give to people , especially people who are walking by – to give them pieces of paper. A “flyer ” (flyer) is a piece of paper that

has information on it, usually about some political  cause, but sometimes just about information that the person passing it out th inks you should know.

Danielle’s flyer is going to list many health reaso ns, because of which students should moderate their drinking. “To moderate” (mode rate) here means to control the amount of something so that it isn’t too high. It isn’t too much or it isn’t too little or too low. Danielle wants the students to m oderate their drinking, meaning she doesn’t want them to stop drinking. She wants them to stop drinking too much. She says, “It’s for their own good.” The expr ession “for your own good” means it’s for your own benefit.

We often use this expression when you are telling s omeone to do something or to not do something when the person doesn’t agree w ith you that it’s a good thing or a bad thing to do. You think it’s good for them;  the person doesn’t agree with you. That would be a case where we would use this e xpression “It’s for your own good.” Parents, for example, use this expression wi th their children when the children, say, don’t want to brush their teeth or e at their vegetables. They may say to the child, “It’s for your own good” – you wi ll benefit from this. It is a good thing for you even if you don’t understand that.

Nabil says, “And you think college students are going to give you the time of day?” The expression “to give someone the time of d ay” doesn’t mean to tell someone the time right now. It means to pay attenti on to someone, to give someone the respect or courtesy that you might expe ct. If you don’t give someone the time of day, you’re not interested in t alking to that person. You’re not even interested in listening to that person. Na bil thinks that these college students will just ignore Danielle standing on the sidewalk passing out her flyers.

Danielle says, “I won’t let them pass until they ag ree to drink responsibly.” The verb “to pass” (pass) here means to move forward an d to go around something that is in your way. If you are walking down the st reet, and I stand right in front of you and I hold my arms out so that you cannot go by  me, I would not be allowing you to pass. If I allow you to pass, I move out of the way so you can continue moving forward, you can continue walking.

Danielle says she’s not going to let these students  pass, meaning she’s not going to let them go into the house, “until they agree to  drink responsibly.” “To drink responsibly” is to avoid drinking too much alcohol – to avoid drinking too much. Nabil says, “I have a feeling we’ll see the cops to night.” “I have a feeling” here means I predict, I expect. Danielle says, “Do you t hink the party will get out of hand?”

Nabil says, “No. I think they’ll be here to arrest the crazy lady waylaying people outside of their house.” Nabil is referring of cour se to Danielle herself. He’s saying the cops, the police, will show up because D anielle is trying to stop people from getting into the house. “To waylay” (waylay) –  one word – is to prevent someone from doing something – to stop someone, to interrupt someone. That’s what Danielle is thinking about doing with these bi nge-drinking college students.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
