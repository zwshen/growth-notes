On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Natalia and Kei discuss some office vocabulary dealing with office furniture.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Natalia:  Is that the Office Shop catalogue?

Kei:  Yeah, I’m in charge of furnishing the new off ices on the second floor.  They need everything – desks, file cabinets, bookcases –  you name it.

Natalia:  That sounds like fun.  I love shopping for new furniture.  Can I help?

Kei:  Yes, definitely.  I’ve picked out a few thing s already, but I’m having a hard time deciding among all of these office chairs.

Natalia:  Get this one.  They’re on casters and are  fully adjustable.

Kei:  Okay, what about desks?  Everybody has a diff erent idea about office desks.

Natalia:  I like this one.  It’s got a keyboard tra y, file drawers, and space for lateral files.  See?

Kei:  All right, I guess that one is as good as any , but what about this one with a hutch?

Natalia:  This desk has an optional hutch.  If the new employees want a hutch, they can order one later.

Kei:  Okay, last but not least, we need bookcases.

Natalia:  These are solid wood and look sturdy.  Wh at do you think?

Kei:  I think there’s one person who’s cut out for this job, and that person is not me!

Our dialogue begins with Natalia saying, “Is that t he Office Shop catalogue?” Office Shop is the name of some store that sells of fice material, not a real place. A “catalogue” is a printed book with many pages tha t usually contains photographs and descriptions – pictures and text ab out what a particular company sells.  So, you might have a clothing catal ogue that shows all the latest dresses and shirts, pants, that sort of thing; you could have a office furniture catalogue that shows things that you can buy for yo ur office.  Catalogues are becoming less common because people now sell on the  Internet and you don’t need to send them a book.

Kei says, “Yeah, I’m in charge of furnishing the ne w offices on the second floor.” “To furnish” (furnish) is a verb meaning to buy fur niture, things like desks and chairs for a certain place, for a house or, in this  case, for an office.  The noun “furnishings” (plural) refers to furniture, but the  verb “to furnish” means to go and buy – select and buy furniture for a particular pla ce.  Kei says that the second floor offices need everything, “desks, file cabinet s, bookcases – you name it.”  A “desk” is a large piece of furniture, like a table,  that you are able to write on or put your computer on and other objects: paper, pencils,  that sort of thing.  Desks can be very small, like a school desk where a student s its, or it can be very large, like what the president of the company might have.  “Fil e cabinets” (sometimes called “filing cabinets,” they’re the same thing) are larg e – typically large pieces of furniture that have big drawers in them – boxes, if  you will, that pull out and you can put into them pieces of paper that are put into  cardboard files.  A “file” is a large piece of cardboard that is folded in half and  you put papers in it, just like you would put meat in a sandwich, and then you put these files into a drawer – a large box – and then that drawer goes into the file  cabinet.  A “cabinet” is a general term for a place to store things – to keep things.  So here, we are keeping the files; it’s a file cabinet.  “Bookcases ” (one word) are large pieces of furniture that hold books, of course.  A bookcase h as straight, flat pieces of either metal or wood, usually two or three, sometimes more ; these are called “shelves.” Individually, it’s a “shelf” (shelf).  And, you put  the books on the shelves.  Kei says they need “desks, file cabinets, bookcases – y ou name it.”  This is an expression; when someone says, “you name it,” they mean that they have given

you a list of possible things, but there are even m ore things that they could say. It’s as if you are starting a list, but then you st op because there are so many things on the list, you use the things that you say  as a sample – as an example.

Natalia says, “That sounds like fun.”  I’m not sure  if she’s joking or being serious there.  “I love shopping for new furniture.”  So I guess she’s serious, she does think this will be fun.  “Can I help?”  Kei says, “ Yes, definitely.  I’ve picked out (I’ve selected a few things here) a few things alre ady, but I’m having a hard time (I’m having a difficult time) deciding among all of  these office chairs.”  A “chair,” of course, is what you sit on; an “office chair” wo uld be a chair that you would typically find in an office.  Often office chairs a re adjustable; you can make them taller or shorter depending on what you want.

Natalia says, “Get this one (meaning buy this one).   They’re on casters and are fully adjustable.”  “Casters” (casters) are small w heels that you put on the bottom of a chair or any very heavy furniture so that you can move it back and forth easily.  You might have a desk on casters, possible .  You probably wouldn’t have a bookcase on casters, but you might have a small f iling cabinet on casters so you could move it back and forth easily.  Natalia s ays that the chairs that he should buy should be adjustable.  “Adjustable” mean s you can move it in different positions, as I was saying earlier, you can make it  higher or lower for example.

Kei says, “Okay, what about desks?  Everybody has a  different idea about office desks.”  Natalia says, “I like this one.  It’s got a keyboard tray, file drawers, and space for lateral files.  See?”  A “keyboard tray” is a small, flat piece of wood or metal that goes underneath your desk, and you can p ull it out and type on it – put your keyboard there so you can enter information in to your computer.  The reason that some desks have keyboard trays is becau se the desk is too tall and in order to have a comfortable position for typing you want the keyboard to be lower than the top of the desk.  A “file drawer” is  similar to what we talked about when we discussed file cabinets.  A “file drawer” i s a drawer that you put files in that’s in a desk; a “file cabinet” is separate from  the desk.  “Lateral files” are a kind of file drawer – file system where the files a re facing either left or right. Normally when you have a file cabinet, you pull out  the drawer and the files are all facing you.  In other words, they are in a dire ction so you can read them easily.  To have a “lateral file” means that the fi les are basically at 90 degrees from where you are so that they don’t face the same  direction as the drawer pulling out, they face in a perpendicular direction  – if that makes any sense.

Kei says, “All right, I guess that one is as good a s any (meaning that’s good enough), but what about this one with a hutch?”  A “hutch” (hutch) is something that goes on top of your desk; it’s usually somethi ng that has some places for

storing things.  So, it’s like a storage cabinet th at goes on the top of a desk, usually at the back of the desk.  Sometimes it can be a place to put your computer, sometimes it’s a place for other equipmen t, it depends on the desk and the hutch.

Natalia says, “This desk has an optional hutch.”  S omething that is “optional” means that it doesn’t have to go with the desk; you  can choose it or not, it isn’t required.  Natalia says, “If the new employees want  a hutch, they can order one later.”  They can get one after they first start us ing the desk.

Kei says, “Okay, last but not least (meaning this i s the last thing we need to do, but it’s not necessarily the least important), we n eed bookcases.”  Natalia says, “These are solid wood and look sturdy.”  “Solid” us ually means strong or well built, something that is firm, something that is st able.  “Solid” has some other meanings in English as well; take a look at our Lea rning Guide for those. “Sturdy” (sturdy) also means strong, well built, so mething that won’t fall down or fall apart easily.  Natalia says, “What do you thin k?”  Kei says, “I think there’s one person who’s cut out for this job, and that person is not me!”  “To be cut out for (something)” means to be well qualified to do somet hing or to be well prepared to do something.  You might say, “I’m not cut out for doing heavy lifting,” or, “I’m not cut out for painting,” it’s not something I would d o a very good job at.  That’s what I tell my wife all the time!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
