This episode is called “Watching Videos on the Internet.”   It’s a dialogue between Sheila and Rudy talking about watching videos on your com puter versus on your television.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Sheila:  Where are you going? 

Rudy:  I’m going to the video store to rent a movie fo r tonight.  Do you want to come? 

Sheila:  You don’t need to do that.  We can watch nea rly any movie you want online.   

Rudy:  Oh, you mean we can pay to download it? 

Sheila:  Yeah, we can download it, but we don’t have to pay for it. 

Rudy:  What do you mean?  You’re not using a file-shari ng site, are you? 

Sheila:  Of course, I am.  Everybody is doing it.   

Rudy:  Aside from the ethical issues, it’s so frustrating wa tching videos online. The ones that stream are constantly pausing to buffer.  The interruptions drive me crazy! 

Sheila:  Yeah, sometimes, but there’s usually a workaroun d.   

 Rudy:  Even so, the movies are usually pirated and they’re so grainy.  I want to watch something in high definition.  Come on, let’s go  to the video store.  It’ll be my treat. 

Sheila:  All right, if you insist, but why can’t we just pay to download it right here at home? 

Rudy:  We could do that, but where would we get the p opcorn?

Sheila asks Rudy, “Where are you going?”  Rudy says, “I’m go ing to the video store to rent a movie for tonight.”  A “video store” i s a store where you can rent or buy a movie; you can rent it for usually two or three days,  sometimes longer. Video stores became very popular in the 1980s, after vide ocassette players became popular.  Now they have DVDs instead of the old ca ssettes.  But, because of the new Internet services and other mail service s, video stores are not as popular now as they were, say, 10 or 15 years ago . 

Rudy asks Sheila if she wants to come with him.  He says, “D o you want to come?” meaning do you want to come with me.  In some pa rts of the country, you would say, “Do you want to come with?”  The idea is “come with me.”  Sheila says, “You don’t need to do that,” meaning you don’t ne ed to go to the video store.  “We can watch nearly any movie you want (almost an y movie you want) online.”  “Online” means on the Internet, on the Wo rld Wide Web.   

Rudy says, “Oh, you mean we can pay to download it?”  “To  download” means to save a file from the Internet or a website onto your com puter.  If you are listening to this on your MP3 player, such as your iPod, you downloa ded the file from the Internet to put it on your player.  Rudy says, “you mean  we can pay to download it?” meaning we pay money and then we download the mo vie.  Sheila says, “Yeah, we can download it, but we don’t have to pay fo r it.”  This is, of course, common on the Internet nowadays, people downloading th ings that they did not pay for.   

Rudy says, “What do you mean?  You’re not using a file-sha ring site, are you?” “File sharing” is when you exchange files, often files tha t you have copied illegally, with someone else.  This is, of course, against  the law but it is common, at least it is common among some people on the Internet .  I don’t to it myself. 

Sheila says, “Of course, I am (of course I’m using a file sh aring site).  Everyone is doing it.”  This is a common excuse for people who do things that are wrong;  

 they’ll say, “Well, everyone is doing it,” meaning it must  be okay if everyone is doing it.   

Rudy says, “Aside from the ethical issues, it’s so frustrating  watching videos online.”  “Aside from” means in addition to, or beside s.  So, in addition to the ethical issues, Rudy is saying, there are other problems: i t’s frustrating to watch the videos online.  “Ethical” means something that is ri ght or wrong; “ethical” refers to whether something is correct or incorrect moral ly, from a position of right and wrong.  Rudy is saying that there are ethical proble ms, meaning it’s wrong to steal someone else’s files without paying them.  But it’s also frustrating; it’s not very satisfying, not very pleasing to watch videos online.  He  says, “The ones that stream are constantly pausing to buffer.”  To “strea m” on the Internet means that you’re not saving the file onto your computer, you ’re just watching or listening to the file from the website but you’re not downloading it, necessarily.  In fact, you’re usually not downloading it if it’s streaming .  When it streams, sometimes because of the slow Internet connections, it has t o stop so that it has enough of the file to continue going.  This is called “to buffer,” when a computer holds data or information for a brief time before usi ng it.  “To pause” means to stop doing something.  So, the video stops – it pauses to  buffer, to get enough data (enough information) to continue.  “Stream,” I should say also, is a word that has a couple of different meanings in English, so of cour se, take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

Rudy says, “The interruptions drive me crazy!”  An “interru ption” is something that stops you from doing what you are doing right now  in order to do something else, usually for a short period of time.  If a parent is talking to a friend of theirs, and their four-year-old child keeps saying, “Mommy, I have a question,” and the parent has to stop and answer the child, the child is in terrupting the parent.  The verb is “to interrupt,” the noun is “an interruption.”   Normally, it’s something that you want to avoid, that you don’t want to happen.  In this case, the video keeps stopping, and that is an interruption for Rudy. 

Sheila says, “Yeah, sometimes (sometimes there are interr uptions that drive you crazy, that make you angry or upset), but there’s usually a w orkaround.”  A “workaround” is a solution that doesn’t fix a problem, b ut let’s you do something in a different way to get around the problem, to get  what you want to have done. Even though you haven’t solved the problem you’re able t o do it.  So for example, your email software stops working.  Well, you can also send email online with your email account, let’s just say, so a workar ound would be to use the Internet browser to send email until you can get you r email software program fixed.  You didn’t solve the problem of your program,  but you found a workaround – you found another way to get the same things done.    

 Rudy says, “Even so (even though there are workarounds for t hese interruption problems), the movies are usually pirated and they’re so  grainy.”  “To pirate,” as a verb, means to, in this case, to copy without permission , especially when we’re talking about music or movies, or podcasts.  That’s “pirati ng” something.  Rudy says, “the movies are usually pirated (meaning they have bee n pirated – stolen) and they’re so grainy.”  Something that is “grainy” is an  image that is not clear or seems a little rough because it has some small spots on i t.  If you take a photograph and you try to enlarge, or make bigger one part of the photograph, sometimes that will cause the photograph to become grain y, you can’t see things clearly. 

Rudy says, “I want to watch something in high definition .”  “High definition” is a certain technology now that you can use with your televisi on; you can buy a television that is HD, or high definition.  It’s supposed  to be a much clearer picture, something that is much higher quality.  I don’t  have a high definition television, so I can’t tell you.  My television is black and white, from the 1960s; so, I guess there are color televisions now, people tell me!   

Rudy says that he wants to watch something in high defini tion, he says, “Come on, let’s go to the video store.  It’ll be my treat.”  A “treat,” in this case, means that you are going to pay for something as a gift for someon e else.  You can use it as a verb: “I will treat you to dinner.”  That means I a m going to invite you to dinner and I will pay for your dinner.  So, Rudy says, “It’ll b e my treat (I will pay for the movie).”  “Treat” has a couple of different meanings in  English, so take a look at our Learning Guide for some more definitions. 

Sheila says, “All right (okay), if you insist.”  This is a ph rase used to show that you will agree to do something, what another person i s suggesting, especially if that person has made a generous offer and it’s somethin g that you want to do anyway.  So, for example I don’t want to go shopping, a nd my wife says, “Well, I’ll buy you a new pair of shoes if you go with me shoppi ng,” so I say, “Okay, if you insist,” meaning I want the pair of shoes, you are aski ng me, you are giving me this gift, therefore I will go.  Then she uses my cr edit card, so it doesn’t really matter! 

Sheila says, “All right, if you insist, but why can’t we ju st pay to download it right here at home?”  She’s saying well, we can pay to downloa d a high quality movie here and not go to the video store.  Rudy says, “We coul d do that, but where would we get the popcorn?”  “Popcorn” is a food that is commonly eaten at movies, at least in the United States.  It is made from  heating dry corn in oil or hot air, and then putting butter and salt on top of the popcorn.  Many video stores  

 sell popcorn in addition to renting videos.  It’s very expe nsive there, however; it’s much cheaper just to buy it at the regular grocery stor e – if you like popcorn! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
