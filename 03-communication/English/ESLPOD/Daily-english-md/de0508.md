This episode is called “Regretting Past Actions.”  It’s a d ialogue between Dennis and Nora using vocabulary about being sorry for things tha t you did.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Dennis:  Oh, why did I let my temper get the best of me ?  I never should have said those things to the new client!

Nora:  Don’t freak out.  I’m sure you didn’t do any da mage that can’t be rectified. It’s true that, in retrospect, you probably shouldn’t ha ve called Nathan, the head of the project, a twerp.

Dennis:  Don’t remind me of what I said!  Hindsight is 20/20.  Now they’re going to think we’re running a dog and pony show.

Nora:  No, they’re not.  Nathan was being unreasonable  and you tried to sugarcoat your objections the best you could.  Everybody could  see that you were trying to pull your punches, but that guy just would n’t give an inch.

Dennis:  Nevertheless, this is going to have repercussions.

Nora:  Oh, here comes the boss now.  I think she wants to  talk to you.

Dennis:  I’ve no doubt about that.

Nora:  What do you suppose she’s going to say?

 Dennis:  I know exactly what she’s going to say: “Don’t let  the door hit you on the way out!”

Our dialogue begins with Dennis saying, “Oh, why did I let my temper get the best of me?”  Your “temper” is your anger.  To say “you l et your temper get the best of you” means that you got very angry, you lost control , you started saying and doing things that you would not normally do.  When  something “gets the best of you,” it defeats you somehow.  In this case, it means that your anger has defeated you in some way and caused you some problems.

Dennis says, “I never should have said those things to the ne w client!” the new customer, obviously talking about something at his job.  No ra says, “Don’t freak out.”  The verb “to freak (freak) out” is an informal t wo-word verb meaning to lose control of yourself, to panic, to get very worried.  “Fr eak” actually has a couple of different meanings in English; you can find more in this episode’s Learning Guide.

Nora says, “I’m sure you didn’t do any damage that can’t b e rectified.”  “To rectify (something)” is to fix something that is broken, to correct  something that is wrong, to repair something.  We often use this verb in  talking about problems that we’ve caused: “I’m going to rectify the situation,” I’m g oing to fix it; I’m going to make it better.  Nora says, “It’s true that, in retrospect , you probably shouldn’t have called Nathan, the head of the project, a twerp.”   “In retrospect” is an expression meaning looking back on something that has alre ady happened; looking at the past, especially when you wish that you woul d have done something differently.  Normally, when someone says “in re trospect,” they’re usually expressing some sort of regret, something they wish they did not do or wish they hadn’t done.

So, Nora is saying it was not a good idea for Dennis to call Nathan, who’s the leader of this project at his work, a twerp.  A “twerp”  (twerp) is an informal insulting word meaning someone who’s stupid, someone wh o you don’t like because they’re annoying or bothering you.  It’s a pretty strong insult; you certainly wouldn’t want to call anyone a twerp at your w ork.  Sometimes the word is used to imply that someone is too young to have sufficien t experience.

Dennis says, “Don’t remind me of what I said!  Hindsight is 20/20.”  “Hind” is “behind,” so “hindsight” means looking back.  When we say yo ur vision – your sight (how well you can see) is “20/20,” that means that it’s perfect.  “Hindsight is 20/20” is an old expression meaning it’s always easy to see  what you did wrong

 or did right when you are looking at the past; it’s much  more difficult to know what to do in the future.  Dennis says, “Now they’re going to  think we’re running a dog and pony show.”  The expression “a dog and pony show” ref ers to a meeting or an event that is organized to impress other people but i sn’t really very important, doesn’t have a lot of depth.  “A dog and pony show” is o ften a somewhat negative way of describing someone going in and giving a presentation, for example, at another company.  A “pony” is a small type of horse that you might see, for example, in the circus.  It’s a small type of hors e that a child might ride, for example.

So Nora says, “No, they’re not (they’re not going to thi nk we are running a dog and pony show).  Nathan was being unreasonable and you  tried to sugarcoat your objections as best you could.”  Remember, Nathan is the guy that Dennis called a twerp.  “Nathan was being unreasonable and you  (Dennis) tried to sugarcoat your objections.”  “To sugarcoat (something)” mea ns to make something seem nicer than it really is, especially somethi ng that’s, perhaps, critical or negative.  “Sugar” is, of course, something that is sweet.  If you put sugar on top of something it may make it taste better – unless, of course, that something is, say, a steak or your eggs.  You shouldn’t put sugar on those – usually!  Dennis was trying to sugarcoat his objections.  You r “objections” are your differences of opinion, things that you have against  what someone else is saying.  “To sugarcoat your objections,” then, means to tr y to give your disagreements but do it in a nice way.

“Everybody could see,” Nora goes on, “that you were trying to pull your punches, but that guy just wouldn’t give an inch.”  “To pull your  punches” means not to use all of your abilities, not to do everything that you possi bly could.  The word “punch” has several different meanings: one meaning come s from boxing, where you take your fist  (your hand – your closed hand) and you t ry to hit the other person.  That’s called a “punch.”  “To pull your punches”  means not to hit the person as hard as you could.  In general, however, it m eans not to use all of your strength and ability.  For more meanings of the word “ punch,” take a look at today’s Learning Guide.  Nora says that Nathan, however, just wouldn’t give an inch.  The expression “to give an inch” is to compromise; to change your idea, even a little bit.  You say one thing; I say something di fferent.  When one of us changes our opinion so that we can agree, we would give an inch – an inch, of course, being a very small amount.  But this guy wouldn’t give an inch; he wouldn’t compromise.

Dennis says, “Nevertheless, this is going to have repercussion s.”  Nevertheless (regardless; even though what you say what is true), this action (what he did by calling him a twerp) will have repercussions.  “Repercussion s” is just another

 word for consequences, usually negative consequences, somethi ng bad that happens because of something else.

Nora says, “Oh, here comes the boss now (meaning the boss is walking towards them).  I think she wants to talk to you.”  Dennis says, “I ’ve no doubt about that,” meaning I’m sure that’s true, she will want to talk to  me.  Nora says, “What do you suppose she’s going to say?” meaning what do you guess, what do you think she’s going to say.  “What do you suppose she’s going to sa y?”  Dennis says, “I know exactly what she’s going to say: ‘Don’t let the door hit you on the way out!’” This is an old expression; don’t let the door hit you on the way out while you’re leaving, in other words.  It’s a phrase used to mean tha t you want someone to leave immediately, usually because they have said something o r done something wrong.  It could mean because they’re fired – they’re lo sing their job, or that they just want that person to leave.  “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out!”  That’s what all my old girlfriends used to say to me!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
