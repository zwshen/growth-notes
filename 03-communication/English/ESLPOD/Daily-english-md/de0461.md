# Using a Guidebook

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 4 61: Using a Guidebook.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 461.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in the beautiful City of Los Angeles, in the golden State  of California.

We invite you to visit our website at eslpod.com and downl oad a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page guide that will h elp you improve your English even faster.

This episode is about using a “guidebook,” which is a specia l book for “tourists,” people visiting another city or another country, that tel ls him about that country: where they should eat, where they can sleep, where they  can stay, and so forth. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Nicki:  Wow, did you buy out the bookstore?!

Tony:  Very funny.  I just got a few guidebooks for our trip to Vancouver.  I want to study up on what the must-see sights are, and then deci de whether we can do some self-guided tours or need to book guided tours.

Nicki:  That’s very conscientious of you.  The trip isn’t for three months.

Tony:  I know, but I want to start sketching out an itin erary now.  I’m going to start out by reading the orientation chapters so I get a feel  for the city.

Nicki:  Good, then at least one of us will know where to go and what to do.

Tony:  After that, I’m going to read the helpful hin ts in the accommodations section.  I want to make sure we stay in the heart of the  city with plenty of nightlife.  I’ll read the section on day trips, too, in  case we have some extra time.

Nicki:  It sounds like you’ve got it covered.

Tony:  I do.  I also want to spend some time learning so me survival phrases so I can talk to the locals.

 Nicki:  Survival phrases?  To visit Vancouver?

Tony:  Yeah, we won’t be able to get around without learning some French, you know.

Nicki:  Really?  Hmm.  I think you’d better keep reading.

Nicki begins the dialogue by saying, “Wow, did you buy out  the bookstore?!”  To “buy out” means to buy everything in a store.  For exampl e, if you really like chocolate and you go to the grocery store and you buy all of the chocolate they sell – everything, that would be to buy out the store.  Nicki is asking Tony if he bought out the bookstore because, apparently, Tony has a  lot of books.

Tony says, “Very funny,” which means I don’t think you’re ve ry funny.  When someone says something to you making a joke and you don’t like the joke, you can say, “very funny,” but you have to say it in a way that s hows that you don’t think it’s very funny.  Tony says, “I just got a few guideboo ks for our trip to Vancouver,” he says, “I want to study up on what the must- see sights are.”  To “study up on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to s pend a lot of time learning about something, usually by reading.  Someone  might say, “I’m going to study up on Greek philosophy.”  I’m going to read Greek philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, in order to know more about them.  That’s “ to study up on.”  You can also say, “to read up on.”

Tony is studying up on the must-see sites in Vancouver, which  is a city in western Canada.  If someone says, “this is must-see,” they me an it is highly recommended, it is something that you really ought to – you really should see. Here in the U.S., one of the television networks had a  slogan – had an advertising expression “must-see TV,” meaning these were sho ws that everyone had to watch because they were so popular.  “Sights” (si ghts) here means interesting or famous things that people would want to  visit.  Here in Los Angeles, for example, some of the must-see sights would be Hollywood Boulevard, the Santa Monica Pier and Beach, probably the Getty Museum, and the Hollywood Sign, which is famous as a symbol of Hollywo od.

Tony says he wants to decide whether he and Nicki can do some  self-guided tours or if they need to book guided tours.  “Self-guid ed tours” are tours (visits; trips to somewhere) where you’re not with anyone who’s a professional tour

 guide, you’re just using, typically, a book that tells you a bout things.  The word “self” added to the beginning of another word usually means by yourself, without anyone else’s help.  Someone could say they are “self-taugh t,” meaning they didn’t have a teacher, they taught themselves.  So, self-g uided tours are tours that you go on by yourself.  If you want someone to help  you, to go with you, that would be a guided tour.

Nicki says, “That’s very conscientious of you.”  “Conscientious” me ans very careful, paying attention to all the little details, d oing everything you’re supposed to do.  If you say, “she’s a conscientious worker,” you mea n she does all of her work, she’s very careful.  I am not very conscientious!

Nicki says, “The trip isn’t for three months,” meaning we aren’t going to go on this trip for three more months.  Tony says, “I know, but I wa nted to start sketching out an itinerary now.”  To “sketch out” is a two-word ph rasal verb meaning to write down some ideas, what we might call “rough idea s.”  You’re not exactly sure but you want, at least, to have a beginning plan .  “Itinerary” is the schedule for your trip: what you’re going to do on the first da y, the second day, the third day, and so forth.  Tony says, “I’m going to start out (I’ m going to begin) by reading the orientation chapters so I get a feel for the city.”  An “orientation” is an overview, something that gives you general knowledge abo ut a thing or a place before you actually begin it, or in this case, before you  actually go there.

Tony is going to read the orientation chapters of the book so he can get a feel for the city.  “To get a feel for (something)” means to beco me familiar with something, to understand it very well.  Nicki says, “Good, then at least one of us will know where to go and what to do.”  Tony says, “Afte r that (after he finishes reading the orientation chapters), I’m going to read the helpful hints in the accommodations section.”  Guidebooks normally have lots of in formation about different things you can do in a city or a place.  A “hin t” is additional or useful information or suggestion, so “helpful hints” are usefu l ideas, useful suggestions. “Accommodations” refers to places where you sleep overnight : hotels, for example.

Tony says, “I want to make sure we stay in the heart of the city with plenty of nightlife.”  The “heart of the city” is the main busine ss and entertainment area of the city – the center of the city.  In many cities, that’s the downtown.  In New York City, Manhattan is the heart of the city; it’s the major , main area in the city. People often complain that Los Angeles is a city that do esn’t really have a heart. That is, there isn’t one center place where thing happe ns.  Tony says that he’s looking for someplace with lots of nightlife.  “Night life” is entertainment that

 happens in the evening, at night.  It usually refers to bars, restaurants, dance clubs, concert halls – places where people would go to enj oy themselves at night.

Tony says, “I’ll read the section on day trips, too, in case  we have some extra time.”  A “day trip” is when you go to, say, a large cit y such as Los Angeles, and then you want to visit a smaller city close to there, but yo u don’t want to stay overnight.  You’re just going to go in the morning an d come back in the afternoon or evening.  So if you come to L.A., you might want to  take a day trip to Santa Barbara, which is about two hours north of the city; or  San Diego, which is two hours south of the city; or Palm Springs, which is two h ours east of the city. These would be day trips from Los Angeles.

Nicki says, “It sounds like you’ve got it covered.”  If someone  says they’ve “got it covered,” they mean they are able to do something, they a re in control of the situation, they are prepared.  Tony is very prepared; Ton y says, “I do.  I also want to spend some time learning some survival phrases so I can talk to the locals.” “Survival phrases” are basic expressions that you might learn when you are visiting a country that uses a language you don’t speak very w ell.  So, if I were to go to Japan, I would have to learn things like “Where is the bathroom?”  “How much does this cost?”  Those would be survival phrases.  Whe n Tony says he wants to be able to talk to the “locals,” he means he wa nts to talk to the people who live in the city – people who are not tourists, peo ple who are permanent residents, people who live all year round in the particu lar area.  “Local” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Nicki says, “Survival phrases?  To visit Vancouver?”  Tony says, “Y eah, we won’t be able to get around without learning some French, yo u know.”  But, of course, this isn’t true.  Vancouver is in the western part of Can ada, and although there are people who speak French there, it is mostly an Engli sh-speaking city.  Nicki says, “Really?  Hmm.  I think you’d better keep reading,” meaning you obviously don’t know very much about Vancouver if you think you have to learn French to visit there.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
