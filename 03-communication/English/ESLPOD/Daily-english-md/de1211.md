[start of dialogue]

Ursula: Weren’t you watching this same movie yester day?

Ian: No, this is the sequel. Yesterday, I watched A ims Pond. This is Aims Pond: Super Spy.

Ursula: Wasn’t this originally a TV show?

Ian: Actually, it was originally a novel, which was  adapted into a long-running TV show. Then, it was turned into a movie franchise. T he new installment is coming out next month and I can’t wait!

Ursula: The latest installment? I thought it was ju st a trilogy.

Ian: No, the original film has spawned four sequels  and two prequels so far.

Ursula: So you’re watching all the films again?

Ian: That’s right, but I’m not stopping there. I’m watching all of the TV show episodes again, too. And if I have time, I’ll even watch the spin-off.

Ursula: Spin-off? I didn’t know there had been a sp in-off.

Ian: There was. Aims Pond’s brother got his own sho w: Jaime Pond: Building Inspector. It wasn’t very successful.

Ursula: I guess we can call you a superfan.

Ian: That’s right. I’m a superfan of the super spy!

This episode is all about “franchises” (franchises) . “Franchises” are films, television shows, video games, and other products that all have the same characters and the same or similar stories. You can  think of, for example, the Star Wars franchise – there are many different Star  Wars movies – or perhaps the Jason Bourne franchise. There are novels with J ason Bourne and then there were movies with Jason Bourne. These are all part of a “franchise” – a similar set of stories and characters.

Ursula begins our dialogue by saying, “Weren’t you watching this same movie yesterday?” Ian says, “No, this is the sequel (sequ el).” A “sequel” is a show or a movie that continues the story from the previous sh ow or movie. So you have the first Star Wars movie and then you have a sequel, w hich continues the story. It tells you what happens after the end of the first m ovie, in effect.

Nowadays we also have what are called “prequels” (p requels). A “prequel” is a show or a movie that says, or tells you, what happe ns before the original movie. And of course, Star Wars has sequels and prequels. Star Trek, another popular franchise that began as a television show and then became a set of movies, has prequels and sequels also.

Ian is watching a sequel. He says, “Yesterday, I wa tched Aims Pond. This is Aims Pond: Super Spy.” A “spy” (spy) is a person wh ose job it is to discover secrets of another country or even another company.  Ursula says, “Wasn’t this originally a TV show?” That is, wasn’t this story f irst on a TV show before it was in a movie. Ian says, “Actually, it was originally a novel.” A “novel” (novel) is, of course, a fictional book. Harry Potter was original ly a character in the novels which were later made into movies.

Another way of saying “made into” is “adapted (adap ted) into.” You can have a story that begins as a novel that is “adapted into a movie” – or in the case of our dialogue, “adapted into a long-running TV show.” “L ong-running” means it was on television for many years, in this case. “Then,” Ia n says, “it was turned into a movie franchise.” “To be turned into” here means so mething similar to “to be

made into” or “to be adapted into.” It just means to be changed into something. In this case, the TV show was turned into a movie fran chise.

Ian says, “The new installment is coming out next m onth and I can’t wait.” The “new installment” (installment) is the new, in this  case, “movie.” The “new installment” is the new part or the new version of some television show, movie, or book series. “The new installment is coming out,” m eaning it will be released. You will be able to watch it next month.

“The latest installment?” Ursula asks. “I thought it was a trilogy.” A “trilogy” (trilogy) is a group of three related books, movies , or stories. The Lord of the Rings was a trilogy. There were three parts to it. There was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. T hose three movies were part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Ursula is confused because she thought that the ser ies that Ian was watching with Aims Pond was a trilogy, and therefore there w ere no more installments to be released. Ian says, “No, the original film has s pawned four sequels and two prequels so far.” The verb “to spawn” (spawn) means  to produce or to generate. The verb is often used in cases like this when some thing produces or generates many different additional parts or additional insta llments. This original movie, according to Ian, “spawned four sequels and two pre quels.”

Ursula says, “So, you’re watching all the films aga in?” Ian says, “That’s right, but I’m not stopping there. I’m watching all of the TV show episodes again, too.” So Ian is going back and watching all of the movies th at are part of this franchise and the original TV episodes that came before the m ovies. “And,” he adds, “if I have time, I’ll even watch the spin-off.”

A “spin-off” (spin-off) is a product that is associ ated with the original show or movie – another show or movie typically that is bas ed on, or comes from, a story or a character in another book, TV show, or movie. “Spin-offs” were quite popular in the 1970s and ’80s in American television. If there was a very popular TV show, sometimes they would take one of the characte rs from that TV show and make a whole new show, an additional show based jus t on that character.

So for example, there was a popular TV show in the 1970s called All in the Family. Well, that was such a popular TV show that the television studio, the company that made that TV show, decided to produce a new show that was based on one of the characters in that show called George Jefferson. And so we had a show called The Jeffersons. And then I think there might have been a spin- off from that show as well.

 Sometimes you have spin-offs of spin-offs – televis ion shows that take characters from other television shows. Spin-offs can also happen in the movie industry, where a character from a popular movie ge ts his or her own movie. Ursula says, “Spin-off? I didn’t know there had bee n a spin-off.” Ian says, “There was. Aims Pond’s brother got his own show: Jaime Po nd: Building Inspector. It wasn’t very successful.”

Ian is talking about this fictional franchise that he is watching. It’s based on a character named Aims Pond. Well, Aims Pond has a br other, and that brother got his own spin-off movie, “Jaime Pond: Building Inspe ctor.” A “building inspector” is a person who has the job of going into a building o r a house and making sure that it is safe. Ian says the spin-off wasn’t very successful.

Ursula says, “I guess we can call you a superfan.” A “superfan” is a person who is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about someth ing. If you, for example, love watching all of the Game of Thrones TV shows, but you also read about them and you go back and read all the books and you  follow the different bloggers about that particular series, you might be  a superfan. You love that series so much that you want to know everything abo ut it.

Ian says, “That’s right. I’m a superfan of the supe r spy!” The word “super” (super) is often used to mean great or wonderful. It can al so mean, as it does here, the best of a certain category. So a “super spy” would be one of the best spies in the world. Ian is a “superfan” of the “super spy,” Aims  Pond, who should not be confused with the character James Bond. That’s a co mpletely different franchise.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
