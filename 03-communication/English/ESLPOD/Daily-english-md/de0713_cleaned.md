This episode is called “Being Physically Strong.”  It’s a dialogue between Takeshi and Paula.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Takeshi:  What do you want me to do with this piano ? 

Paula:  I want you to move it from the living room to the family room.  You’re as strong as an ox and that’s why I called you for hel p. 

Takeshi:  Lucky me.  I don’t think I can move that piano by myself, though. 

Paula:  You’re built and have muscles coming out of  your ears.  Come on!  Let’s put those muscles to work! 

Takeshi:  I haven’t been working out as much recent ly.  I don’t think I’m up to the job.   

Paula:  I’ll cut you some slack.  I’ll help. 

Takeshi:  What I’m trying to tell you is that you’l l need at least three big guys to move this piano.  There’s no way around it.   

Paula:  Come on.  Be a man.  Suck it up!  I’m willi ng to put my back into it, so let’s move this thing. 

Takeshi:  You are completely deluded if you think w e’re going to move this piano one inch.  I, for one, am not putting my back out t rying to do the work of three! 

[end of dialogue] 

Takeshi begins by saying to Paula, “What do you wan t me to do with this piano?” A “piano,” you probably know, is a musical instrume nt that has white and black we call “keys” that you play on.  Paula says, “I wa nt you to move it from the living room to the family room.”  Some big houses have two  spaces where many people can sit down and talk or watch television.  The family room is separate from the living room.  I’m not sure exactly the dif ference, since my house is too small to have a family room and a living room, but basically it’s another living room.  It’s a place where you have a sofa and perha ps some chairs.  People often put their televisions, or in this case their piano in the living room or family room.   

Paula says, “You’re as strong as an ox and that’s w hy I called you for help.” Takeshi is as strong as an ox.  An “ox” is usually a male cow, what we call a “bull,” that has had some of its male sexual organs  removed – the word is “castration” – and the animal is then trained to pu ll heavy things, to be a strong farm animal.  So we have this expression “strong as  an ox” to describe a very strong person – physically strong person, someone w ith a lot of muscles.  Not like me! 

Takeshi says, “Lucky me.”  Now, there he’s being sa rcastic; he doesn’t really mean he’s lucky.  He’s saying that he’s not that ha ppy that he has to come over and move this piano, that’s the idea.  He says, “I don’t think I can move that piano by myself, though.”  “Though” means however. 

Paula says, “You’re built and have muscles coming o ut of your ears.”  To say that someone is “built” (built) in this context means th ey have very strong muscles, you can see them on their body.  “Built” has a numb er of meanings in English, however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some  additional ones.  Paula says that Takeshi has muscles coming out of his ear s, which is kind of a strange expression.  To have something “coming out of your ears” means to have a lot of something, to have more than what you actually need .  Paula says, “Come on! Let’s put those muscles to work!”  Let’s start usin g those muscles. 

Takeshi says, “I haven’t been working out much rece ntly.  I don’t think I’m up to the job.”  “To work out” is a two-word phrasal verb  that here means to exercise, to do physical exercise.  Someone says, “I’m going to go work out at the gym.” I’m going to go do exercises at the gym; maybe run or lift weights, that sort of thing.  Takeshi says that he’s not up to the job.  The expression “to be up to the job” means to be prepared and ready to do something , to feel that you are able to  

do it.  You might say about someone, “Well, she’s r eally not up to the job,” meaning she isn’t prepared to do this, whatever it is. 

Paula says, “I’ll cut you some slack.  I’ll help.”  “To cut (someone) some slack” (slack) is an expression meaning I will make the si tuation easier for someone else, in this case so they don’t have to work as ha rd.  “To cut (someone) some slack” can also mean not to require them to do as m uch as you want, to go easy on them, not to blame them, to give them some extra  time for example, or whatever they need to finish a difficult job. 

Takeshi says, “What I’m trying to tell you is that you’ll need at least three big guys (big men) to move the piano.  There’s no way a round it.”  The expression “there’s no way around it” means that you cannot ch ange something; this is the way it really is; it’s unavoidable; you have to do it this way or this has to be done. In this case, Paula needs to get three strong men, not just one.   

Paula says, “Come on.  Be a man.  Suck it up!”  The se are all informal expressions.  “Come on” means let’s go; let’s get s tarted.  It can sometimes be used to indicate that the other person is resisting  what you are suggesting, doesn’t want to do what you are suggesting, and you  are encouraging them – you are urging them to do what you want to do.  Pau la says, “Come on.  Be a man.”  “Be a man” is a phrase used to tell a man th at he needs to be braver or stronger, and stop crying or complaining.  “Suck it  up!” is a phrase used to tell someone that he or she needs to stop complaining an d do what is necessary, even if it is difficult.  So, you may say, “Oh, it’ s too hot.  I can’t cut the grass today (the lawn today),” and your wife says, “Oh, just su ck it up!”  You need to go and do it; stop complaining.  Paula says, “I’m willing to put my back into it, so let’s move this thing.”  “To put your back into (somethin g)” means to work very hard, especially at something that requires a lot of phys ical strength. 

Takeshi says, “You are completely deluded if you th ink we’re going to move this piano one inch.”  “To be deluded” (deluded) means t o be confused, to believe something that is not true, or to be fooled.  You’r e really saying they have some sort of psychological problem; they think something  that isn’t true.  The noun would be “delusions.”  Takeshi says to Paula, “You are completely deluded if you think we’re going to move this piano one inch (mean ing even a very small amount).  I, for one, am not putting my back out tr ying to do the work of three (or of three men)!”  “I, for one” is a phrase that we u se to emphasize your opinion about something, your position about something.  It ’s not as commonly used nowadays, but you will still hear it.  “I, for one,  am not going to go to the beach today, because it’s raining.”  You can go, but I am  not.  It is often said when someone else wants to do something, or other people  are doing something but  

you are not going to do it.  So you’re expressing s omewhat more strongly, with emphasis, that you are not going to do this thing.   

“I, for one,” Takeshi says, “am not putting my back  out trying to do the work of three (men).”  “To put your back out” means to inju re or to hurt the back.  The back part of your body, usually between your should ers and your waist or your buttocks, that’s your back.  “To put your back out”  means to hurt it, to injure it, which, of course, can be very painful.  Takeshi doe sn’t want to put his back out trying to do the work of three, in this case of thr ee men.  “To do the work of (a certain number of people)” means to do the same amo unt of work that is normally performed by three men or by whatever numb er you decide to use here. So Takeshi says no, he’s not going to help Paula mo ve – or try to move this piano.  Paula will just have to go and pay someone,  rather than asking her friend Takeshi to come over and do it probably for free, a lthough we’re not sure here. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

Takeshi:  What do you want me to do with this piano ? 

Paula:  I want you to move it from the living room to the family room.  You’re as strong as an ox and that’s why I called you for hel p.
