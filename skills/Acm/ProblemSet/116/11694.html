<h1>Problem F - Gokigen Naname</h1>
<h3>Time limit: X seconds</h3>
<!-- author: Jimmy Mårdell -->

<p>
<i>Gokigen Naname</i> is a Japanese puzzle game played on a square
grid in which numbers in circles appear at some of the intersections
on the grid.

<p>
The objective is to draw diagonal lines in each cell of the grid, such
that the number in each circle equals the number of lines extending
from that circle. Additionally, it is forbidden for the diagonal lines
to form an enclosed loop.

<p>
The first figure shows the start position of a puzzle. The second
figure shows the solution to the same puzzle. A <i>Gokigen Naname</i>
puzzle always has exactly one solution.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N<25) which denotes the total number of test cases.
The description of each test case is given below:<br><br>

The first line of each test case contains a single integer <i>n</i> (<i>2
&le; n &le; 7</i>), the number of cells along each of the sides in the
square grid.  Then follow <i>n + 1</i> lines containing the contents
of the intersections of the grid cells. Each such line will contain a
string of <i>n + 1</i> characters, either a digit between 0 and 4,
inclusive, or a period ('.') indicating that there is no number at
this intersection (arbitrarily many lines may connect to it).

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each test case print <i>n</i> lines, each line containing
exactly <i>n</i> characters. Each character should either be a slash
or a backslash, denoting how the corresponding grid cell is filled.
