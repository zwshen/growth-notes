# Hiring for a Job

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 44 - Hiring for a Job.  

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 44. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  

In this episode, we’re going to discuss choosing wh om to hire for a job. Let’s get started.  > Last week, my administrative assistant gave notice that he was quitting in two weeks. It couldn't have come at a worse time. It wa s a very busy time of year, but there was nothing I could do. Right away, we put a want ad in the classifieds and received several applications for the job. I called  in four of them for interviews, and I had narrowed it down to two candidates.  
> The first was Claudia Trujillo. From her résumé, I knew that she had had four years of experience working at a telecommunications  company. She looked promising, and when she arrived for the interview, she was dressed professionally and seemed personable. When I asked her about her experience, she answered my questions with confidence. She soun ded like a hard worker and showed a lot of perseverance. The only drawback s were that she was a little chatty and she also seemed a little disorganized.  
> The second candidate was Alex Mayhew. Alex had more  experience than Claudia, but in different capacities, and only had one year of experience as an administrative assistant. When I met Alex, he seeme d a little rough around the edges. He was earnest and eager but didn't have the  air of someone who had worked in a corporate environment. Still, he seemed  bright and easy to get along with. He did strike me as being a little shy, but I  think that was because he was nervous.  
> So, those are my two options. Now, which one should  I hire? I need to give it some more thought.

Lucy begins her story by talking about hiring, or f illing a job position that is open in her company. She started by saying that her “adm inistrative assistant gave notice that he was quitting in two weeks.” An “admi nistrative assistant” is someone who works for a boss or, really, works for anyone in a company who has the job of taking care of or administering some thing, whether it's running a department or running a project or just simply runn ing a large operation.  

An “assistant” is always someone who helps someone else. The word “administrative” refers to taking care of something , running something, managing something. In the old days, we used to call this pe rson a “secretary.” But nowadays, “secretary” doesn't sound very important,  and so now we call these people “administrative assistants.” It’s sort of li ke a teacher is called a “teacher” if they're in a high school or grade school, but when they go to the university, they’re called a “professor.” It sounds more import ant, doesn't it? Sometimes administrative assistants do more than just type le tters and make copies and, nowadays, send emails. “Administrative assistants” sometimes do other things.  

There's also another job category called a “persona l assistant.” A “personal assistant” is different than an administrative assi stant in that a personal assistant usually helps someone take care of their personal m atters. People who have a lot of money – people who are rich – often don't ha ve a lot of time, and so they hire a personal assistant to go and buy their groce ries and pay their bills and get their cars fixed and so forth. An “administrative a ssistant” is always someone related to a specific job within a company, for exa mple. Lucy's administrative assistant “gave notice.” “To give notice” (notice) means to tell your company that you are going to leave, that you are quitting.  

In this case, Lucy’s administrative assistant gave notice that he was quitting in two weeks. Two weeks is a common time that people g ive here in the United States, if they're going to quit a job. In fact, so me jobs require that you give them a “two-week notice,” meaning you give them at least  two weeks’ advanced notice that you are going to quit. So, if you're going to quit on the 14th of the month, you have to tell them by the 1st of the month that you are going to quit. Of course, I’m not sure what they would do if you didn't give them  two weeks notice. It's more of a courtesy thing – that is, it's more of a nice thi ng to do, a professional thing to do.  

Lucy said that this decision of her administrative assistant to quit “couldn't have come at a worse time.” This expression, “couldn't h ave come at a worse (worse) time,” is used when something very bad has happened  to us and there are other bad things that will happen because of it, or they happen at the same time. If you drive in your car and it begins to rain, that might  be considered something bad  

happening. Then five minutes later if you run out o f gas, that, of course, would be worse. That would be something that would be in add ition to the bad thing that already happened. So, if something bad is already h appening and then something else that is bad happens, we might use th is expression, “It couldn't have come at a worse time.”  

Lucy says she put a “want ad in the classifieds.” A  “want (want) ad (ad)” is an advertisement or notice that you used to put in the  newspaper – now, you would put it on the Internet – that is used to find someo ne for a job. If your company needs someone for a certain job, they need to hire someone. They might put a want ad in the newspaper or on the Internet.  

The “classifieds” is a general term we use for adve rtising or notices that appear typically in the back of a newspaper. The “classifi ed ads” are small little advertisements, often for people who are selling th eir cars or selling furniture. One section of the classified ads is called the “wa nt ads,” and these are ads for jobs. There are also personal ads in a classified a ds section. These are ads for people who, I guess, are looking for friendship or love – at least, that's one of the things you would put in a personal ad. It could be for other things as well. Nowadays people just put things on their Facebook p age, I guess. 

Lucy said that she called in four candidates to int erview. “To call in” is a phrasal verb meaning to contact or email or call someone an d ask them if they would come to the office in order to be interviewed. “To interview” someone means to sit down and ask them questions – in this case, abo ut their experience – so that you can decide whether you want to give them a job or not. Lucy says she “narrowed it down” to two candidates. A “candidate”  here means someone who is applying for a job, someone who wants a certain job . They don't have the job yet; they want the job. You are still deciding.  

Lucy “narrowed it down to two candidates.” “To narr ow something down” is a phrasal verb meaning to reduce the number of possib ilities. If you have ten people applying for the job – who want the job – yo u may “narrow it down” to a group of two or three people. You’re getting rid of  some people and focusing on just a small group. The first person Lucy talked to  was Claudia Trujillo. Lucy says, “From her résumé, I knew that she had had fou r years of experience working at a telecommunications company.”  

A “résumé” (résumé) is a list of all of your educat ion, experiences, and the jobs that you have had in the past. It's what you give s ome potential employers, someone who might give you a job, to let them know what your experience is. For certain kinds of jobs, such as a job at the uni versity, we don't use the word  

résumé. We use the words “curriculum vitae.” ”Vitae ” (vitae) is a Latin word. We will often just use the abbreviation “CV.” A “CV” i s simply a professional résumé – a résumé for a more important job or a job at the u niversity.  

Lucy says the person she was going to interview, Cl audia, worked at “a telecommunications company.” A “telecommunications company” might be, for example, a telephone company – a company that deals  with any sort of electronic communications. Lucy said that Claudia “ looked promising” because she “dressed professionally and seemed personable.”  When we say you “look promising,” we mean that it looks like you're prett y good. It looks like you may be a good person, in this case, for the job.  

“To dress professionally” means to dress in a forma l way. The way you would dress to an office meeting or a special event, a bu siness event. For a man, that usually means wearing a suit and a tie and pants. F or a woman, it might be a business suit or possibly a dress. That would be “d ressing professionally.” Wearing a bikini or T-shirts or shorts and tennis s hoes – those would not be examples of dressing professionally. Unless you wor ked at the beach, of course. 

Lucy said the candidate was “personable.” “To be pe rsonable” (personable) means to be kind, to be polite, to be nice. The can didate that Lucy was interviewing “spoke with confidence.” “To speak wit h confidence” means to be sure of yourself, to answer knowing that you are gi ving the correct answer. She said this woman Claudia was “a hard worker.” A “har d worker” is someone who works hard, who works very well, who doesn't sit ar ound and look at their Facebook page or surf the Internet or read their em ail. It's a person who is actually working – not a person who is sitting arou nd listening to podcasts, for example.  

She also described Claudia as someone who “showed a  lot of perseverance.” “Perseverance” comes from the verb “to persevere” ( persevere), which means to continue doing your work even though there are a lo t of difficulties. Someone with perseverance continues on even though it is di fficult. The only drawbacks that Lucy found with this candidate were that “she was a little chatty” and “seemed a little disorganized.”  

A “drawback” (drawback) is a disadvantage, a negati ve thing about a person or a situation. The “drawbacks” for Claudia are that “sh e was a little chatty” and she “seemed a little disorganized.” “To be chatty” (cha tty) means to talk too much. “To be disorganized” means to be not organized, to be someone who doesn't have everything neat and clean on their desk, to be  someone who doesn't seem  

to know what to do next, who doesn't have a good pl an for the future. That might describe a “disorganized” person. That also describ es me, I think. 

Lucy interviewed another candidate, another person who wanted this job, by the name of Alex. She says Alex had different “capaciti es.” “Capacities” means abilities, things that you are able to do. He was, however, “a little rough around the edges.” That expression “to be a little rough ( rough) around the edges (edges)” means that you don't have a lot of experie nce. You have a lot of potential. You have a lot of possibilities, but you  still don't have a lot of experience. That is to be “rough around the edges.”  You need more training, more time on the job, to be what you have the poten tial to be.  

Lucy said Alex was “earnest and eager.” “To be earn est” (earnest) means here, basically, to be honest, to be sincere, to be someo ne who you can trust. “To be eager” (eager) means to be very motivated, to be wi lling to do something. Lucy also said that Alex “didn't have the air of someone  who had worked in a corporate environment.” “To have the air (air) of” something means to give the impression, to appear. “That person has the air of someone who is very intelligent” means he appears to be; he looks to be  someone who is very intelligent.  

Well, Alex did not “have the air of someone who had  worked in a corporate environment.” A “corporate environment” just means a large company, a large business. The candidate Lucy interviewed was “brigh t and easy to get along with.” “To be bright” means to be intelligent, to b e smart. If you're “easy to get along with,” you’re someone who is personable, who’ s easy to talk to, who doesn't cause a lot of problems.  

Lucy then says that Alex “did strike me as being a little shy.” The expression “to strike you” or “to strike me” means to appear to yo u or to appear to me. “He strikes me as an honest man” means it seems to me t hat he is an honest man. That's the impression I get from talking to him. Al ex strikes Lucy as being someone who is a little shy. If you're “shy” (shy),  you're the opposite of “chatty.” You don't like to talk to people. You perhaps are a  little afraid to go up to someone and talk to them and try to communicate wit h them. Lucy said she was going to review her options – her choices – and tha t she needed to “give it some more thought.” “To give something more thought” mea ns to think about it more, to consider it for a longer period of time.  

Now let's listen to our story, this time at a norma l speed.  

[start of story]  

 Last week, my administrative assistant gave notice that he was quitting in two weeks. It couldn't have come at a worse time. It wa s a very busy time of the year, but there was nothing I could do. Right away, we pu t a want ad in the classifieds and received several applications for the job. I ca lled in four of them for interviews, and I had narrowed it down to two candi dates.  

The first was Claudia Trujillo. From her résumé, I knew that she had had four years of experience working at a telecommunications  company. She looked promising, and when she arrived for the interview, she was dressed professionally and seemed personable. When I asked her about her experience, she answered my questions with confidence. She soun ded like a hard worker and showed a lot of perseverance. The only drawback s were that she was a little chatty and she also seemed a little disorganized.  

The second candidate was Alex Mayhew. Alex had more  experience than Claudia, but in different capacities, and only had one year of experience as an administrative assistant. When I met Alex, he seeme d a little rough around the edges. He was earnest and eager but didn't have the  air of someone who had worked in a corporate environment. Still, he seemed  bright and easy to get along with. He did strike me as being a little shy, but I  think that was because he was nervous.  

So, those are my two options. Now, which one should  I hire? I need to give it some more thought.
