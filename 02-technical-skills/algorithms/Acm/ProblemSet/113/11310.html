<h1>Problem D</h1>
<h1>DELIVERY DEBACLE</h1>
</center>

<p>Wolfgang Puck has two very peculiar habits:
<li>I.&nbsp; He only makes two shapes of cakes. One is square and has an area of one unit.
The other is L-shaped and has an area of three units.</li><br>
<li>II. He will only deliver cakes packed in very specific box sizes.
The boxes are always 2 units wide and are of varying length.</li></p>

<p>One day Wolfgang wondered in how many different ways he can pack his cakes into
certain sized boxes. Can you help him?</p>
