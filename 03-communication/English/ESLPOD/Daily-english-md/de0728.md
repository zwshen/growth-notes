This episode is a dialogue between Elaine and Tony,  using vocabulary to describe how good you are at doing something.  Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Elaine:  Welcome to your first day as an intern in our company office.  Let me show you around.  This is the main office area with  a cubicle for each employee. Are you pretty good with computers?

Tony:  Actually, my computer knowledge is pretty ba sic.  The only thing I’m adept at is videogames.  I’m not up to snuff on actually doing work on one.

Elaine:  Okay, well you should be proficient by the  end of your internship.  Over there is where we keep the photocopier and fax mach ine.  Have you used them before?

Tony:  I’m an expert on the copier.  I can use it w ith one hand tied behind my back.  I’m particularly good at photocopying body p arts.

Elaine:  Uh, great.

Tony:  But the fax…I’ve only used one once and I ne ver quite mastered it.

Elaine:  I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it pretty quickly.  And this is the break room.  You have your standard refrigerator and vend ing machines.

Tony:  Hey, I’m really good with vending machines.  That’s one machine I know inside and out.

Elaine:  How could I have guessed that the one thin g you really excel at is working the vending machine?

Elaine says to Tony, “Welcome to your first day as an intern in our company office.”  An “intern” (intern) is a person, usually  a student, who works in an organization for a short period of time – a month, two months, maybe a year – to learn how to do something and to prepare for their future doing that kind of job. Lots of organizations have interns; they are young students, either still in college or just graduated from college, that perform differ ent jobs.  Sometimes they are paid, sometimes they are volunteer; you don’t get p aid but you do get experience.  I think I need an intern here at the C enter for Educational Development.  You know, someone to bring my coffee in the morning – or my tea, as the case may be.  Well, Elaine is welcoming  – is saying hello to Tony, who is an intern.  She says, “Let me show you aroun d.”  Let me give you a tour; let me tell you where everything is.  She then says , “This is the main office area with a cubicle for each employee.”  A “cubicle” (cu bicle) is a small work area within a larger office space.  Typically, it has a desk, a computer, a telephone. There are walls around it, but the walls don’t go a ll the way up to the ceiling. That’s a cubicle.

Elaine then asks Tony, “Are you pretty good with co mputers?”  Tony says, “Actually, my computer knowledge is pretty basic.”  When we say our knowledge about something is “basic,” we mean that it isn’t v ery much; it’s the minimum that you need to know; you could be much, much better; it’s very low, very beginning level.  “Basic” has a number of different meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more of those.  Tony says, “The only thing I’m adept at is videogames.”  “To be adept (adept) at (something)” means to be able to do something very well, to be very good at doing or using something. “He’s adept at certain programming languages,” Java  and PHP – I don’t know – something you’re good at.  Tony says he’s adept at videogames, but “I’m not up to snuff on actually doing work on one.”  “To be up  to snuff” (snuff) means to perform at a satisfactory level, to meet someone’s expectations, to be good enough to do something.  I am up to snuff on record ing podcasts; I’m able to do it.  I can’t do a lot of other things, but I am up to snuff on the recording part anyway.

Elaine says, “Okay, well you should be proficient b y the end of your internship.” Your “internship” is the time that you are an inter n.  “To be proficient” (proficient) means to be good at something, to be very good at it.  You might be an expert or you might just have a lot of knowledge, but you are  very good at what you do.

We often talk about proficiency in languages, being  able to speak them and understand them and so forth.  Elaine says, “Over t here is where we keep (where we have) the photocopier and the fax machine.”  A “ photocopier,” more commonly called a “copying machine” or just a “copi er,” is a machine that produces an image on a piece of paper from what you  give it.  So it sort of takes the image and reproduces it onto a piece of paper; that’s a copying machine.  A “fax machine” is a machine that uses phone lines to  send images of paper to another machine – another fax or fax machine.  Fax machines are becoming less and less common now, with the Internet and email.

Tony says, “I’m an expert on the copier.”  “To be a n expert” means to be someone who knows almost everything about something .  You could be an expert on ancient Greek art or an expert on how to fix your car.  Tony is an expert on copying machines.  He says, “I can use it  with one hand tied behind my back.”  The expression “to have one hand tied behin d your back” means you can do something very easily, without any difficulty.  To tie your hand would be to take a piece of rope or string so that you couldn’t  move your hand.  If you tied it behind your back, you could only do something with one hand – with one arm. The idea is that you’re so good you don’t need both  arms – both hands to do it. Tony, again, is making a little bit of a joke here.   He says, “I’m particularly good at (I’m very good at) photocopying body parts.”  A “bo dy part” is a part of your body: your arm, your leg, your hand, and so forth.  Somet imes in offices as a joke people will take pictures of their head or other pa rts of their body and give them to someone as a joke.  So Tony is an intern who’s m aking a joke.  Elaine is not really happy with this joke; she says, “Uh, great.”   She doesn’t really mean “great,” she says it in a way that makes us underst and that she doesn’t really think the joke is very funny.

Tony says, “But the fax…I’ve only used one once and  I never quite mastered it.” “To master (something)” is to become very good at s omething; it’s to become an expert.  Elaine says, “I’m sure you’ll get the hang  of it pretty quickly.”  “To get the hang (hang) of (something)” means to learn how to d o something, to learn how to do something correctly.  She says, “this is the bre ak room.”  A “break room” is a room in an office where you can go to eat, to relax .  Many employees get a break – a 15 minute break every morning and every afterno on in addition to their, say, 30 minute lunch break, and this is where you can go  in the building.  It usually has chairs and tables, sometimes machines that sell  things: candy and soda, coffee, etc.  Elaine says, “You have your standard refrigerator (your normal refrigerator) and vending machines.”  We just expla ined a “vending machine,” it’s a machine that you put money into and it gives you food or drink or other things.

Tony says, “Hey, I’m really good with vending machi nes.”  I know how to use them very well; again, another joke.  He says, “Tha t’s one machine I know inside and out.”  “To know (something) inside and out” mea ns to know it very well, to have knowledge of all the different parts of someth ing.  Elaine says, “How could I have guessed that the one thing you really excel at  is working the vending machine?”  The first part of this question, “how co uld I have guessed,” means it should have been obvious.  It’s a kind of a strange  expression, but what she’s saying is it is obvious, knowing you – or knowing w hat I do about you, that in this case you really excel at working with the vending m achine.  “To excel” (excel), as a verb, means to do something very well, to become a master at doing something.  We have the adjective “excellent,” whic h is related.  Elaine says that Tony really excels at working the vending machine, meaning using the vending machine.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
