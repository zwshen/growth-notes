This episode is a dialogue between Sean and Ayako a bout someone making an offer, a proposal of marriage to another person, wh o I guess doesn’t expect it. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sean:  By now, I think you know how I feel about yo u. I’m madly in love with you and I believe in my heart of hearts that you’re my soul mate.

Ayako:  That’s really sweet of you to say.

Sean:  And because I feel the way I do, I would lik e to ask you a very important question.

Ayako:  Okay, but why are you getting down on one k nee?

Sean:  Ayako, would you marry me?

Ayako:  Marry you?! Is this a marriage proposal?

Sean:  Yes, and before you say anything else, I jus t want you to know that I’ve given this a lot of thought and I’m convinced that we’re made for each other.

Ayako:  I don’t think...

Sean:  And you just have to say the word and we cou ld elope tomorrow, if you wanted to.

Ayako:  Elope?!

Sean:  Or, if you prefer, we can have a lavish wedd ing. I’m not picky. I just want us to be husband and wife.

Ayako:  Sean, you’re a really nice guy, but don’t y ou think you might be jumping the gun?

Sean:  No. You know what they say: “When it’s right , it’s right.”

Ayako:  We’ve only been on two dates!

Sean:  Yes, but they have been the best two dates of my life!

Sean begins by saying to Ayako, “By now by this poi nt in time, I think you know how I feel about you. I'm madly in love with you.” To be “in love” with someone means that you feel a strong romantic connection. I n this case, to be “madly in love” means to be very much in love, to have very s trong romantic feelings toward another person. I'm madly in love with you. “And,” Sean continues, “I believe in my heart of hearts that you are my soul mate, that you're my soul mate.” “In my heart of hearts” is a phrase we use w hen you are saying something that you believe in very much, that you know is tru e. In my heart of hearts, what I really believe, what I really think – is what Sean is saying here. He really believes that Ayako is his soul mate. A “soul” (soul) “mate”  (mate) is a person that has all of the qualities and characteristics for a romantic  partner, for the perfect romantic partner, someone who you could spend the rest of yo ur life with, who understands the world the way you understand the wo rld (even if you're crazy!).

Ayako says, “That’s really sweet of you to say.” “S weet” (sweet) here means nice, kind. It's not a very strong word, however. W hen you say, “Oh, that’s very sweet of him,” you mean it's nice of him, it's kind  of him. It's definitely a positive thing to say about someone, but perhaps not what yo u would say when someone says that you are his or her soul mate.

Sean says, continuing on, “And because I feel the w ay I do because I have these thoughts, these beliefs, these feelings, I would li ke to ask you a very important question.”

Ayako says, “Okay, but why are you getting down on one knee?” The expression “to get down on one knee” means to bend one knee an d let the other knee of your leg go down against the ground. That’s the tra ditional pose or the traditional position that a man uses to ask a woman to marry hi m. To get down on one knee

means to ask someone to marry you and traditionally  that’s what a man would do in asking a woman to marry him.

Sean says, “Ayako, would you marry me?” Would you b ecome my wife?

Ayako says, “Marry you?” She’s quite surprised, sho cked even. “Is this a marriage proposal?” “A marriage proposal” is a requ est from one person, usually the man (traditionally), to marry a woman. So, Ayak o is asking quite surprisedly if Sean is proposing to marry her.

Sean says, “Yes, and before you say anything else, I just want you to know that I've given this a lot of thought. I've thought abou t it a lot. I've been thinking about it and I'm convinced, I know for sure that we're ma de for each other.” We are made for each other. “To be made for each other” is  sort of like having a soul mate, when you are saying that this other person in  this romantic relationship is perfect for you, that you each have the characteris tics that matched, that go together, and that make you a perfect romantic coup le. Of course, there no such thing as a perfect romantic couple, but many people  do believe that their husband or wife was “made for them,” meaning they'r e perfect for them.

Ayako says, “I don’t think…” Sean interrupts her an d says, “And you just have to say the word and we could elope tomorrow if you wan ted to.” The expression “to say the word” means indicate that you want to do so mething or the time that you want something done. “You say the word and I will t ake you to Venice Beach, and we will go swimming.” That means whenever you want to, you just tell me and I will do it. That’s what Sean is saying here t o our poor Ayako. Sean says, “We could elope tomorrow.” To “elope” (elope) means  to go and get married in secret. You don’t tell any of your family or your f riends, you just go somewhere. Here in the United States, people often go to Las V egas because it's easy, I guess, to get married there. They have lots of plac es to get married and you'll get married without telling any of your friends and fam ily. That is to elope. Sean is saying that if Ayako wants to, they can go and get married today, tomorrow. They could elope suddenly, without having any sort of we dding or celebration.

Ayako says, “Elope?!” Sean says, “Or, if you prefer , if you want, we can have a lavish wedding.” He’s saying okay, well if you don’ t want to elope, we can also have a very expensive, fancy, elegant wedding cerem ony. That’s what lavish means, something that usually costs a lot of money.  “I'm not picky,” Sean says, meaning it doesn’t matter to me. I'm not going to b e mad one way or the other. He can do whatever Ayako wants. “I just want us to be husband and wife” – to be married.

Ayako says, “Sean, you're a really nice guy, but do n’t you think you might be jumping the gun?” To “jump the gun” means to do som ething too soon, before it's the right time, to do something perhaps before some thing is completed. So, if you invite everyone to a party and you haven’t asked yo ur husband or wife if they can come over to your house, you probably jumped the gu n. You’ve done something that you should have waited to do until you were su re of, or certain of, other things. The expression probably comes from track. T hat is when people race to see who’s fastest. Usually the race begins by shoot ing a gun in the air. “To jump the gun” means to start running before the gun fire s and you, of course, can't do that. That’s the whole point of having the gun, so everyone starts at the same time. Anyway, back to our story.

Ayako thinks that Sean is jumping the gun. Sean say s, “No. You know what they say: When it's right, it's right.” This is a phrase  that Sean uses to defend his decision. He’s saying that when it's the right time , you just have to do it, and now is the right time.

Ayako says, “We've only been on two dates,” meaning  they’ve only gone out romantically somewhere as a couple or gotten togeth er twice, two dates. A “date” is a romantic appointment, dinner and a movie, that  sort of thing.

Sean says, “Yes, but they have been the best two da tes of my life.” Well, even if they were the best two dates of his life, we would probably agree that Sean is jumping the gun in asking this woman to marry him.
