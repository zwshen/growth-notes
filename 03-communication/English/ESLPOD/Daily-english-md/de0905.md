This episode is a dialogue about someone who is going to get married and needs to get the official government marriage license. Le t's get started.

[start of dialog]

Yves:  Help me fill out this application for our ma rriage license.

Vanessa:  Can’t you do it?  I’m really busy with wo rk right now.  Do as much as you can and ask me if you don’t know something.

Yves:  Okay, I’ll try, but I’m reading through the requirements, and it’s a good idea for both of us to know what they are.

Vanessa:  Okay, then just read them out loud to me.

Yves:  All right.  We need to bring identification and it’s best to bring our birth certificates, just in case.  We don’t need blood te sts and there’s no waiting period in this state.  Are you listening?

Vanessa:  To every word.  Go on.

Yves:  For people who have been married before, the y’ll have to bring proof of divorce, death, or annulment.  Okay, since you’ve b een married before, you’ll need to bring a copy of your final divorce decree.  Did you hear that?

Vanessa:  Yeah, yeah.

Yves:  We can choose any qualified officiant and the marriage license is valid for 90 days – that’s 90 days to get married and have the marriage recorded.  We only have 90 days after we get the license to get m arried, got that?

 Vanessa:  Sure, 90 days.  No problem.

Yves:  I’m starting to wonder.  If you don’t have t ime to fill out our marriage license application, how will you make time for our  wedding?

Vanessa:  What?  I’m really busy right now.  Let’s talk about it later.

Yves:  Is it just me, or does this conversation not  bode well for our future marriage?

Our dialogue begins with Yves – which in English, s pelled “Eve” would be a woman's name, but this is the French “Yves” and so it’s a man – Yves says, “Help me fill out this application for our marriage  license.” Yves and Vanessa are going to get married and when you get married in the United States, you have to fill out or complete an application. An “applicatio n” is a form that you are required to complete with information about yourself. This is an application for a marriage license.

The state governments in the United States each con trol the giving of marriage licenses. A license is recognition by the governmen t that you are officially married, that you are married according to the law.  That's a marriage license. It’s sort of like a license to drive except you don't ha ve to take a test to be married. You probably should  have to take a test to be married but you don't. You have to do that only if you want to drive a car.

Vanessa says, “Can't you do it? I'm really busy wit h work right now. Do as much as you can and just ask me if you don't know someth ing.” Vanessa is very busy, she says, too busy to even help fill out the applic ation for her marriage license. Yves says, “Okay, I'll try, but I'm reading through  the requirements and it's a good idea for both of us to know what they are.” So Yves  says, “Yes, I understand you're busy, but I think you should do this with me .” Vanessa says, “Okay. Then just read them out loud to me.” “Out loud” means sp eaking the words so that other people can hear them. The opposite of out lou d would be “in silence” or “to yourself” – where you read something but you’re not  saying anything as you're reading.

Yves says, “Okay” – actually he says, “All right,” which means okay, “we need to bring identification and it's best to bring our bir th certificates just in case.” “Identification” is some document that proves that you are who you say you are.

Typically, identification would be a driver’s licen se or a passport, but for some things, like getting married, some states might req uire a birth certificate, which says you were born with this name, at this place, o n this date.

Yves says, “We don't need blood tests and there is no waiting period in this state.” “Blood tests” are analyses of your blood to  determine if you have any diseases or illnesses that can be detected that way . Many states used to require that the man and the woman getting married have a b lood test. I think there’s still maybe one state that still requires blood tests. the blood test is not to determine, as some people think, whether these two people are biologically compatible, whether they'll be a good match. That, of course, i sn't something you could figure out from a blood test. If you could, we could save a lot of problems but unfortunately, you can't determine the most importa nt things about the person you're getting married to by testing their blood.

Now, blood tests were used to make sure that one of  the people getting married didn't have diseases that might harm the other pers on – specifically, syphilis, which is a sexually transmitted disease, a disease that you get from someone who has the disease by having sexual relations with  that person. At one time, in the 1930’s and 1940’s, it was thought that syphilis  was a big problem and so we had to have blood tests to make sure that the disea se didn't spread, didn't infect more people, but it was decided that it wasn't as b ig a problem as people thought, and so most of these blood tests in almost  every state have been eliminated. Interestingly enough, however, the rate  of syphilis has almost doubled in the United States in the last 10 years.

Yves says that, “We don't need blood tests and ther e is no waiting period in this state.” In some states, you can't just get married on the day that you decide to get married. You can’t go down and decide, “I’m going to get married today.” Instead, you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can get your marriage license.

That's probably a good idea. If you woke up this mo rning and said, “Hmm, I'm going to get married today,” that's probably not a very good idea. You should probably think about it for at least a few days. As  in the case of blood tests, however, most states do not have a waiting period, or at least there are a lot of states that don't. California does not. So, you can  fly to California and get married that same day. Pretty exciting! I don't recommend it, but you can do it. States that do have waiting periods typically require that you wait only maybe three to five days – not very long.

Yves says, “Are you listening?” He thinks that Vane ssa is not listening to him. Vanessa, however, says “To every word.” I'm listeni ng to every word you say – go on, continue. Yves says, “For people who have be en married before, they'll have to bring proof of divorce.” “Proof” is some so rt of document or evidence or object that you have that demonstrates that what yo u are saying is true. If you have been married, and then have legally ended your  marriage, have divorced your partner, you have to prove that. You have to p rove it typically through something called a “divorce decree” or a “final div orce decree” (decree).

A “final divorce decree” is just a piece of paper f rom the place where you were divorced, saying, “Yes, in fact, these two people a re no longer married.” It's also possible, although it's not very common, that you can end a marriage not with divorce but with “annulment.” “Annulment” (annulmen t) is when you have a situation where something happens that makes the ma rriage invalid, that the conditions for marriage are not met.

One of the conditions for a couple to be legally ma rried in most places or at least in many places is that they have sexual relations. If they don't, the marriage can be annulled. Marriage is not legally, technically, a marriage until the couple has sexual relations. Annulments however, are quite rar e.

Divorces however, are not rare, and in our story, it looks like Vanessa has been married before and divorced. So, she will need to bring proof of that. Interesting statistic: more second marriages fail than first ma rriages, and more third marriages fail than second marriages. You would thi nk that people would have experience with marriage the first time, and so the  second time would be successful, but it's in fact just the opposite. So,  if you've gotten a divorce once, you're much more likely to get a divorce again.

Vanessa doesn't seem to be listening to Yves. Yves says, “Did you hear that? And Vanessa says, “Yeah, yeah.” You can tell she's not interested. Yves goes on, “You can choose any qualified officiant.” An “o fficiant” (officiant) is usually a religious official – a priest, a minister, a rabbi,  an imam – who is recognized as a religious official and can therefore marry you, can  say that you are married. You don't have to go to a religious official, however. You can get married by someone from the government, by a judge, for example.

Yves says that, “The marriage license is valid for 90 days.” So, you get your marriage license and then you must use that marriag e license, you must actually get married, within 90 days. You have to get marrie d and then go back and return the license to the government to say, “Yes, we got married on this date, by this

person.” That's having your marriage recorded. “To be recorded” here means to be registered officially with the government.

Again, Yves asked Vanessa if she's listening if she  understands, and Vanessa says, “Sure, no problem.” Yves says, “I'm starting to wonder” – I'm starting to have doubts. “If you don't have time to fill out ou r marriage license application, how will you make time for our wedding?” “To make t ime for something” is to schedule something, to take some action to make sur e that you have time for something. Your “wedding” of course, is the ceremon y in which you get married. It's those few minutes or perhaps hour, during whic h you have the marriage ceremony.

Vanessa says, “What? I'm really busy right now. Let 's talk about it later.” Yves says, “Is it just me, or does this conversation not  bode well for our future marriage?” The expression “Is it just me or” is use d when we are sort of making a joke, trying to say that “It seems obvious to me bu t other people do not seem to have noticed or don't seem to think it is obvious.”  “Is it just me” means “Am I the only one who thinks this?” What does Yves think? He  thinks that this conversation that he has just had with Vanessa does  not “bode (bode) well” for his marriage. “To bode well” is to be a good sign. “To not  bode well” is to be a bad sign, an indication that something bad is going  to happen in the future.

Now let’s listen to our dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
