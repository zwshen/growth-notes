Our dialogue begins with Teresa saying to Adrian, “ Hey, where are you going? We have a meeting in 10 minutes.” Adrian says, “I’m  sorry. I’m going to have to postpone.”“To postpone” (postpone) means to do some thing later than you had planned on or than had been originally scheduled. I t’s to change the time or even the day of something.Usuallywe postpone something w hen there’s some problem, some difficulty in doing what we were plan ning on doing.

Adrian says,“I’m in the middle of putting out fires , and I’ve had to clear my schedule to deal with the latest crisis.”The expres sion “to put out” something, as a phrasal verb, means to either turn something off( for example, “I put out the lights”)or to extinguish a fire – to stop the fire from burning.“The firefighters put out the fire in the house.” Here, however, “putting  out fires” is used to mean taking care of difficult situations, taking care an d providing solutions for difficult problems – often, problems that come up without a l ot of warning.

“To clear your schedule” means to free time in your  day to cancel other things, usually so that you can spend time on, in this case , “putting out fires” – taking care of some immediate problems that must be solved  right away.A“crisis” (crisis) is a very important and urgent or immediate problem  – a problem you have to take care of or deal with right away. That’s a “cri sis.”

Well, in our dialogue, it seems that Adrian has som e sort of crisis. Teresa says,“Can I help?” Adrian says,“I wish you could,” meaning “I wish you could help, but you can’t.”He says,“With the new layoffs,  I feel like I’m being pulled in several directions at once.” A “layoff,” as a noun,  is when someone is fired from his or her job –when you lose your job.If a company  is having difficulty and it’s not making very much money, there may be layoffs – people who are, to use the verb form now,“laid off.”“To lay off” is a phrasal verb and is two words.A“layoff” as a noun is one word.

So, at Adrian’s company, it seems as though there h ave been layoffs,and this means, we’re guessing, that he has to do more work since there are fewer people working there. That’s why he says,“I feel li ke I’m being pulled in several directions at once.”“To be pulled (pulled) in sever al directions at once” means to need to do a lot of different things, especially wh en the number of things that you have to do is great. There are a lot of things that  you have to do all at the same time or with some sense of urgency.

Adrian says,“As soon as I feel like I’m making head way with one problem, I get another thrown at me.”“To make headway” (headway) i s a phrasal verb meaning to make progress, to advance toward some goal.“We’r e making headway on the paperwork we have to complete” – we’re making progr ess, we’re doing better.

Every time that Adrian feels as though he is making  headway with one problem, he says, “I get another thrown at me.”“Thrown (thro wn) at”is an expression that means “imposed on another person,” especially when it’s some responsibility that you would rather not have.“My boss has thrown sever al problems at me.” I have to take care of them.He has told me to take care of  them. “Thrown” is, obviously, the past participle of the verb “to throw.”

Teresa says,“I know exactly what you mean. I always  feel like it’s crunch time around here because we’re so shorthanded.”The phras e “crunch (crunch) time” refers to a period of time when a lot of things hav e to be completed, and you have to work really hard in order to complete them.  Many students, for example, wait until the last week of their class to do their  big project – then, it’s crunch time.They have to get a lot of things done in a sma ll amount of time. “To be shorthanded” means to not have enough people to do a job. Teresa complains that the company is shorthanded; it doesn’t have en ough employees, enough people to do all the work that needs to be done.

Adrian says,“I’m so tired of everything being urgen t all the time and needing attentionASAP.”“To be urgent” (urgent) means to nee d immediate attention – something that you have to do right away. It can’t wait – that’s urgent.In Adrian’s case, he says he’s “tired of everything being urgen t all the time and needing attention ASAP.”“ASAP” is an acronym for“as soon as  possible.”As soon as possible – without delay, in other words.

Adrian continues,“I long for the days when projects  had timelines and people followed them.”“He longs for the day” means he want s very badly to return to the time when this certain thing happened – in this cas e,“when projects had timelines and people followed them.”So, “to long for” somethi ng means to desire something, to want it a great deal.“Timelines” (tim elines) are schedules, plans about when things are going to be completed. Adrian  says,“I’ve got to go,” meaning I have to leave now.

Teresa says, “Hey, when are we going to have that m eeting?”In other words, when are we going to have the meeting that we were supposed to have in 10 minutes? Adrian says,“As soon as things quiet down. ”“To quiet (quiet) down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become calmer, to not be rushing so much.“To rush” (rush) means to go fast.So, to be re laxed, to be calm.

Sometimeswe use this phrasal verb to mean to not ta lk so loud or to be quiet.“To quiet down a group of students” would be to get the  students to stop talking so loudly. Teachers have to do that all the time.

Teresa says,“When will that be?”That is, when will things quiet down? Adrian says,“I’ll let you know as soon as the latest disas ter has been averted.”A“disaster”(disaster)is a serious, large p roblem that has very negative consequences. We sometimes talk about “natural disa sters”– that would be an earthquake or a flood or a big snowstorm. These thi ngs cause damage and therefore have negative consequences. You can also have a disaster in your own life; something bad could happen to you. Maybe you lose your cat. Would that be a disaster?Maybe.Not for me.

The verb“to avert” (avert) means to prevent somethi ng from happening or to avoid something.You’ll often hear this verb or see this verb in writing with the word “disaster.”“We’re trying to avert a disaster”–  we’re trying to prevent something bad from happening.Adrian is saying here that he won’t have time, until there are no crises, to meet with Teresa.

Now let’s listento the dialogue, this time at a nor mal speed.
