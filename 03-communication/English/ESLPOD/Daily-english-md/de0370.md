This episode is called “Describing a Bad Experience.”  It’s a dialogue between Caterina and Oliver about, well, something that was not very fun.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Caterina:  I can’t believe I let you rope me into seeing this performance.  It was so lame!  Oliver:  Okay, you’re right, it was the pits.  I had no idea it was going to be amateur hour.  When I saw the ad in the paper describing this as an experimental play, I thought it might be interesting.  Was I wrong!  Caterina:  I didn’t understand that play at all.  The music, if you can call it that, was atrocious.  How can anyone be expected to listen to that for more than three seconds without going crazy?  I wish I could get those two hours of my life back!  Oliver:  Yeah, it’s left a bad taste in my mouth, too.  Let’s go see something else.  I want to put this whole experience behind me.    Caterina:  Benjamin’s Bar is having open-mic tonight.  Do you want to check it out?  Oliver:  No way!  Wild horses couldn’t drag me to another amateur show.  How about a movie instead?  Caterina:  Okay, I’d go to a movie.
