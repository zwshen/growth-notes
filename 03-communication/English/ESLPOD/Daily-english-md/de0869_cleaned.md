[start of dialog] 

Tour guide:  Welcome to Hollywood Tours, everybody.   I’m your tour guide for today, and I’ll be showing you some of the most mem orable locations in Hollywood history.  Every seat in this double-decke r bus is a good one, and you’ll be able to see every landmark we drive by.  Uh, do you have a question? 

Elvira:  Yes, I do.  When do we see the celebrities ?  I want to get my picture taken with a real Hollywood star!  

Tour guide:  Well, we’ll be stopping at some celebr ity homes and it’s possible that we’ll catch a glimpse of a celebrity.  I’ll also be  taking you to some filming locations where classic and well-known movies were filmed on location. 

Elvira:  Yes, but can we go to some celebrity hango uts?  I really want to meet Johnny Depp. 

Tour guide:  I’m not sure... 

Elvira:  If I saw a Johnny Depp or any celebrity wa lking down the street, I would just go crazy!  For sure I’d chase them down! 

Tour guide:  This isn’t a hop-on, hop-off bus and i t would be really dangerous to run out into L.A. traffic. 

Elvira:  Oh, what’s a little danger if I can come f ace to face with a real life movie star?

We begin the dialog with the tour guide, the person  who leads a group of people as the travel around and look at things, visit plac es that might be interesting for someone who is not from that part of the world or f rom that area. This is a case of a tour guide here in Los Angeles, here in Hollyw ood. “Hollywood” is just one part of the city of Los Angeles. It’s not its own c ity. It’s just what we would call a neighborhood, a section of the city of Los Angeles,  although the word really gets used to describe the entire industry, the entire bu siness of making movies and television shows and other things here in Southern California. The tour guide says, “Welcome to Hollywood Tours, everybody.” You can actually take a tour here in Los Angeles that will drive you around to f amous places. This is one of those tours.  

The tour guide says, “I’m your tour guide for today  and I’ll be showing you” – I’ll be taking you to – “some of the most memorable loca tions in Hollywood history.” “Memorable” (memorable) is something that is easy t o remember, usually because it’s very exciting or very interesting. The  guide says that “Every seat in this double-decker bus is a good one.” A “double-de cker (decker) bus” is a bus that has two stories or two levels. These are most famously found in London, in England, where you’ll see the double-decker buses.  

I’ve ridden in double-decker buses once or twice. T hey’re very popular for tours because you can put a lot of people in the same amo unt of space. You can put people on the bottom and people on the top. For mos t of the Hollywood tour buses, the top floor or level of the bus is open; t hat is, there’s no roof over it. So if it’s a sunny day, you’re going to get a lot of sun,  and if it’s a rainy day, well, you probably want to go down to the first level.  

The tour guide says that “You’ll be able to see eve ry landmark we drive by.” A “landmark” (landmark) is some structure, object, lo cation that is somehow important, that is typically connected with somethi ng special – perhaps it was a special historical event, perhaps it was a famous m ovie, maybe a famous person died here or someone was born there. You can go and  visit the houses where famous people may have lived. Those could be consid ered landmarks. Or you could go to, say, the capital of our country, Washi ngton D.C., and see the big monuments and memorials, the statues. These could a ll be considered landmarks, especially when they’re found at places where something important happened.   

 Someone has a question – Elvira. Elvira says, “When  do we see the celebrities?” This is a question that everyone who comes to Los A ngeles wants to know the answer to – Where are the celebrities? A “celebrity ” (celebrity) is a very famous person, usually a singer, an actor, an athlete, a p odcaster – well, most of those would be celebrities. Elvira wants to get her pictu re taken with – she wants to take a picture with her standing next to a real Hol lywood star. A “star” is like a celebrity, usually an actor, an actress who’s very popular in a movie or a television show.  

The tour guide says, “Well, we’ll be stopping at so me celebrity homes and it’s possible that we’ll catch a glimpse of a celebrity. ” “To catch a glimpse” (glimpse) means to get a very brief, quick look at something or someone without seeing it very well. So, you see someone walking down the str eet and they’re walking very fast and you just get a quick glimpse of them. You just get a glimpse of what they look like. You don’t see them very well because the y go by so quickly. The tour guide says, “Maybe we’ll catch a glimpse.” Notice t he verb “to catch (catch)” a glimpse. You could also say “get a glimpse” of some thing or someone.  

The guide says, “I’ll be taking you to some filming  locations.” A “filming location” is anywhere where they used the area for a movie or  a television show. Here in Los Angeles, there are filming locations everywhere , and they use different parts of the city to make movies and television shows, in cluding my neighborhood, where I live. You will often see a film crew – a gr oup of people making a movie. You know they’re there because they’re blocking the  streets and you can’t drive around there and I really hate that. But it’s part of living in this city – living in Los Angeles.  

Other parts of the city have filming locations more  frequently. Downtown Los Angeles is often – parts of it are often closed bec ause they are filming. The tour guide says that they’re going to go where some clas sic and well-known movies were filmed “on location.” The expression “on-locat ion” means they were filmed right there. They weren’t filmed back in what we ca ll a “studio” (studio), which is a place where you would normally make a movie or a te levision show, that’s inside a large building. They would actually, when you fil m on location, they will go to the place that is in the script – that is, in the s tory or that represents some place in the story. So they’ll go to a real house or they ’ll go to a street and they will film there, not inside of a studio.  

Elvira says, “Yes but can we go to some celebrity h angouts?” A “hangout” (hangout) is a place where you spend a lot of time,  in a casual informal way, just having fun, not working – just enjoying yourself. I t can also be a verb, “to  

hangout.” “I’m going to hang out with my friends.” That means I’m going to go spend time with my friends. As a noun, a hangout is  a place where people go to have fun.  

Elvira wants to go to some celebrity hangouts. Are there celebrity hangouts? Yes, there are. There are restaurants and hotels an d bars where a lot of celebrities go – not me, but a lot of celebrities d o. I’ve seen celebrities here in Los Angeles many times but usually at the grocery s tore or at the pharmacy or at the post office, not very exciting places.  

Elvira says that she really wants to meet one celeb rity – Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp, you may know, is a famous actor, probably mos t famous for his role in the Pirates of the Caribbean  – those movies. The tour guide says that he’s not sure. Elvira interrupts – stops him from speaking – and s ays, “If I saw Johnny Depp or any celebrity walking down the street, I would just  go crazy.” She would be so happy. She would “go crazy,” go wild.  

“For sure” – meaning I’m absolutely sure – “I would  chase them down.” “To chase someone down” means to follow someone who is moving away from you until you reach them, until you catch them. Maybe t hey’re trying to escape from you. Maybe they don’t know that you are behind them . Elvira would chase down any celebrities she saw walking down on the street.  I do not recommend that, however here in Los Angeles. You could have the pol ice at your hotel door soon after.  

The tour guide says, “This isn’t a hop-on, hop-off bus.” “To hop-on” means to get on a bus. “To hop-off” means to get off the bus. A “hop-on, hop-off bus,” however, is a special kind of tour bus that many ci ties have where you pay one amount of money for the whole day, typically, and t hat bus will go around in a circle to a lot of different famous places that tou rists will want to see. And you can get on the bus, it will take you to another place, and then you can get off, visit that place, go back, get on the bus again. That’s a  hop-on, hop-off bus.  

The tour guide says, “It would be really dangerous”  – not safe – “to run out into L.A. traffic.” “To run out” would mean to walk out where the cars are. “L.A.” is, of course, Los Angeles and “traffic” refers to the car s going back and forth on the street. Elvira says, “Oh, what’s a little danger if  I can come face to face with a real life movie star?” “What’s a little danger” mea ns it’s not important if it’s unsafe, if it’s dangerous, because the reward, the benefit, would be so great. “I would come face to face,” meaning I would meet some one personally – that person standing right in front of me – with a real life celebrity. “Real life” means  

real, actual. It’s just a way of emphasizing. When someone says “real life,” they mean real, someone who is actually that thing, in t his case, a movie star.  

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
