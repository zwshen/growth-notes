This episode is called “Learning Self-Defense.”  It’s a d ialogue between a teacher and a student.  The student is learning how she can defe nd herself against other people who may try to harm or hurt her, but she isn’t  a very good student.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue]  

Teacher:  Welcome, everybody, to this self-defense class.  To day, you’ll learn how to size up a situation and how to tell the differe nce between a harmless situation and a threatening one.  You’ll also begin t o learn some hand-to-hand combat moves to defend yourselves. 

Amy:  Oh, good.  I can’t wait to learn some martial ar ts so I can beat up anyone who tries anything. 

Teacher:  Well, the best thing we can do in a dangerou s situation is to avoid having to fight.  It’s not a good idea to confront some one pumped up on adrenaline.  If you can defuse the situation or run awa y, that would be the best strategy. 

Amy:  All right, but if someone is harassing me, I want to be ready to do some damage. 

Teacher:  I’m not sure if that’s the right mindset… 

Amy:  I always trust my instincts.  If my intuition tells m e that someone may be dangerous, I want to get in the first punch.   

Teacher:  Whoa, that’s not the purpose of this class.  You ’re here to learn defense, remember?  

 Amy:  Yes, but you know what they say: The best defense is a  good offense!

We begin with the teacher saying, “Welcome, everybody, to this self-defense class.”  “Self-defense” are the physical skills to protect your self when someone is attacking you or perhaps you are being attacked by an anim al, but usually it refers to being attacked by another person – another hum an being.  Self-defense allows you to protect yourself so that you don’t get hu rt.  The teachers says that today, you’ll learn how to size up a situation.  “To size up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to assess, to determine the characteristics of so mething including how important it is, or how big it is, or how serious i t is.  To size up a situation is to be able to look at the situation and decide what it s characteristics are: is this important, is this not important, is this person angry, a re they not angry, and so forth.  For more meanings of this word “size,” take a lo ok at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations. 

The teacher says the students are also going to learn h ow to tell the difference (how to distinguish) between a harmless situation and a threatening one. “Harmless” is the opposite of “harm,” harm means to hur t someone or something. If you say something is “harmless,” you mean that it cannot hurt anything or anyone.  Here, we’re talking about a harmless situation , a situation that is not dangerous versus a threatening one.  “To threaten,” as  a verb, means to say or do something to another person so that they are scared or  frightened; usually you’re saying that you’re going to hurt them.  “If you d on’t be quiet, I’m going to punch you in the mouth (I’m going to hit you with my fi st),” that is to threaten someone.  So, “threatening” (with an “ing”) means a d angerous, scary, or frightening situation. 

The teachers says, “You’ll also begin to learn some hand -to-hand combat moves to defend yourself.”  “Hand-to-hand combat” is when yo u have two people fighting without any weapons – two people fighting, t ypically, with just their hands.  Sometimes people use it to mean just two peopl e fighting, perhaps one might have a weapon, but the idea is that you have the se two people fighting each other, not with guns usually.  “Combat” is merely a nother word for fight. Here, the students are going to learn some hand-to-h and combat moves.  A “move” is a way that you would move your body; it’s a noun,  a “move.”  You’re doing something with your body, moving your arms and leg s in a certain way, perhaps.  “To defend yourself” means to protect yourself, to make sure that no one else hurts you. 

 Amy, the students, says, “Oh, good.  I can’t wait to learn  some martial arts so I can beat up anyone who tries anything.”  Amy says she can’t wait; she is very eager to begin learning some martial arts.  “Martial arts” are the fighting styles, most of which come from Asia, where people learn to de fend themselves without weapons, using only their body.  Karate, Judo, Kung Fu –  these are all examples of martial arts – Tae Kwon Do, and others.  “To beat up (someone)” or “to beat (someone) up” is another one of those two-word phrasal verbs; this one means to hit someone, usually to hit them many times so that yo u have hurt them a great deal – cause them a lot of pain or even injury.  Amy wants to beat up somebody using the martial arts that she’s learning in cla ss.  She wants to be up anyone who “tries anything,” meaning anyone who tries, i n this case, to hurt her. 

The teacher said, “Well, the best thing we can do in  a dangerous situation is to avoid having to fight,” you don’t want to have to figh t.  “It’s not a good idea,” he says, “to confront someone pumped up on adrenaline.  “To  confront” usually means to deal directly with someone, especially if that pe rson is dangerous.  To confront someone, in this case, may be to tell someone to  go away or to tell this person that you are going to fight them unless they lea ve, something like that; that would be to confront someone.  You can also confro nt someone in a non- fighting way; you may need to talk to one of your emplo yees or someone who works for you, and you need to talk to them about someth ing they did wrong. You will go up and confront them about the problem.  Maybe they lied, maybe they didn’t do their job, and so forth.  So that can also be confronting someone. 

The teachers says, “It’s not a good idea to confront some one pumped up on adrenaline.”  “To be pumped up” means to be very excited , very interested, very eager to do something.  “Adrenaline” is a chemical the body makes when you are excited, frightened, or angry; it usually makes your heart beat faster (go faster) and your breathing faster.  To be pumped up on adren aline can be a dangerous thing because this person may be interested and eager t o fight you, so you don’t want to confront them.  “If you can defuse the situation ,” he says, “or run away, that would be the best strategy.”  “To defuse (defuse) a  situation” means to make it less dangerous, to make it safer.  Now, if you can’t de fuse a situation you can also “run away,” just leave the place where you are. 

Amy says, “All right, but if someone is harassing me, I wan t to be ready to do some damage.”  “To harass” (harass) means to bother or an noy someone.  Here, it usually means to makes someone’s life difficult; maybe th ey’re yelling at you, they’re doing things that make you uncomfortable.  Amy w ants to be able to do some damage to someone who is harassing her.  “To do some  damage” means to do something that will change a situation; in this ca se, to hurt someone. 

 The teacher says, “I’m not sure if that’s the right min dset.”  A “mindset” (one word) is a way of thinking about something; another wor d for this is “perspective.” The teacher says I’m not sure that you, Amy, have the rig ht mindset.  Amy says, “I always trust my instincts.”  Your “instincts” are things that you know naturally, without having studied them or learned them.  It’s sor t of like knowledge you are born with.  Amy says, “If my intuition (which is another word for “instincts”) tells me that someone may be dangerous, I want to get in th e first punch.”  A “punch” is an act of hitting a person or a thing very hard with your closed fist – with your closed hand.  “To get in the first punch” means you want  to be the first person to throw a punch; notice we use the verb “to throw a punch, ” to hit someone.  You don’t want to wait until somebody hits you first; you wan t to get in the first punch or you want to throw the first punch. 

The teacher says, “Whoa (meaning calm down, wait a min ute), that’s not the purpose of this class.  You’re here to learn defense, rem ember?”  Amy says, “Yes, but you know what they say: The best defense is a good  offense!” “Offense” is the opposite of defense; offense would be t o attack another person or a thing, even though they have not attacked you.  Amy q uotes an old saying: “The best defense is a good offense,” meaning the best w ay to defend yourself is to attack the other person first.  The teacher, I am gu essing, does not agree with Amy’s mindset! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
