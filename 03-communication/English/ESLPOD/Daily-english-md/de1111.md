Shivan: Have you noticed any other symptoms?

Emily: He seems to have trouble concentrating and h as insomnia.

Shivan: Um, really?

Emily: Yes, and I’m afraid he’s having suicidal tho ughts. He seems distant and distracted, staring off into space. He’s not his us ual self.

Shivan: How can you tell?

Emily begins by saying to Shivan, “I think Jackson is depressed.” “To be depressed” means to have feelings of extreme sadnes s and what we might describe as “hopelessness,” like you can’t see a po ssible good outcome for your situation. “Depression” is the noun form of the ver b “to be depressed.” Shivan says, “How can you tell?” The phrase “how can you t ell” (tell) is used to ask someone to explain how they know what they know, wh at evidence they are using, what are the indications that they are seein g that would lead them to this conclusion.

Emily says, “Well, he’s been suffering from a loss of appetite and is generally lethargic.” “To suffer from” something is to experi ence a problem from some situation, often an injury or an illness. We say pe ople suffer from diseases. “He suffers from malaria.” He has the disease of malari a, and he’s feeling the negative effects of that disease. Emily says that J ackson is “suffering from a loss of appetite” (appetite). Your “appetite” is your in terest in food, your feeling hungry for food. So, a “loss of appetite” would be a lack of interest in food – when you don’t feel hungry.

Jackson is also, according to Emily, “lethargic” (l ethargic). “Lethargic” is an adjective describing someone who doesn’t have a lot  of energy, who seems very tired or perhaps simply isn’t interested in the wor ld around him. Shivan says, “Have you noticed any other symptoms?” A “symptom” (symptom) is a physical condition that is a result of, or a consequence of,  an injury or an illness.

So if you have, say, the flu – influenza – one of t he symptoms might be a fever, a high temperature that indicates or tells you that y ou are sick. Shivan is asking Emily if she has noticed any other indications or s ymptoms that Jackson is depressed. Emily responds, “He seems to have troubl e concentrating and has insomnia.” “To concentrate” means to focus your att ention on something without being distracted.

“Insomnia” (insomnia) is the inability to fall asle ep or to remain asleep. Someone with insomnia is often up late at night because he cannot sleep. In fact, insomnia really means the inability to sleep. It could be ca used by many different things – that is to say, it could be a symptom of many diffe rent kinds of illnesses or problems, or maybe you’re just drinking too much co ffee at night. Although usually the cause is more serious. Emily says that Jackson is having “trouble

concentrating and has insomnia.” Shivan says, “Um, really?” Emily says, “Yes, and I’m afraid he’s having suicidal thoughts.”

The word “suicidal” (suicidal) relates to having th oughts about wanting to kill yourself, about wanting to end your own life. Emily  says that Jackson “seems distant and distracted, staring off into space. He’ s not his usual self.” “To be distant” (distant) means to seem as though you aren ’t really connected to the person you’re talking to, or you’re not perhaps eve n paying attention to the person you’re talking to, or you’re very reserved e motionally. You’re not indicating your feelings or emotions to the other p erson. All of those could be described as being distant.

“To be distracted” (distracted) means not being abl e to concentrate or focus because you’re thinking about something else. If yo u are sitting at a café, talking to your wife or girlfriend, and a beautiful woman w alks by, you might get distracted. You might look over at the beautiful wo man instead of listening to your wife or girlfriend. This is a very, very bad idea, guys, because she will notice and, well, let’s just say your life will be a little les s happy that day. So, “distracted” is usually a condition that you do not want to be in. It’s usually a bad thing.

Now, sometimes when people are feeling sad or somet hing bad happens, you want to be distracted – that is, you don’t want to concentrate on the bad thing. You want to be distracted by something else, so it can sometimes be a good thing, if what you are being distracted from is a b ad thing. So you may think being distracted from your wife or girlfriend is a good thing, and your wife or girlfriend might think something else.

Anyway, back to our story. Emily describes Jackson as “staring off into space.” “To stare” (stare) means to look at something for a  long time, to focus on something. “To stare off into space” means to look out at nothing in particular, to seem to be thinking about something and not focusin g on anything that you’re actually looking at. So, it’s an interesting expres sion.

Normally, “to stare at” something means to focus on  something. But if we say someone is “staring off into space,” we mean a pers on is looking in a certain direction or looking at something – it seems. His e yes are open, but he’s not actually focusing on anything physical, if you will . He’s thinking about something else. Another verb we might use here is “to daydrea m” (daydream). “To daydream” means to be thinking about things in a di stracted way, rather than what you should be thinking about.

Emily finally says that Jackson is “not his usual s elf.” Your “usual (usual) self (self)” is the way you normally act, is the way you  normally behave. If someone says, “He’s not his usual self,” we mean he’s actin g strangely. He’s acting differently from the way that we would expect him t o act. Shivan says, “How can you tell?” Once again, the same expression: How do you know? Emily says, “What do you mean?”

Shivan says, “I mean he looks the same to me. He ju st swims back and forth in the fish tank.” All this time, we think that Shivan  and Emily are talking about a human being being depressed – but no, it seems as t hough they’re talking about a fish. Many people like to keep fish in their hous es in a container called a “fish tank” (tank). Fish tanks are usually made of glass so that you can see the fish swimming back and forth.

Now you see, I think fish would be one pet that I m ight enjoy because you don’t really have to do anything for the fish. You don’t have to take the fish for a walk. You have to clean up after the fish a little bit, I  guess, and feed the fish, but really, fish don’t really require a lot of work. I think it’s the kind of animal that I might enjoy having in my house. Well, Emily and Shi van apparently have a fish, and they’re worried that the fish is depressed.

Emily says, “Just look at him. He’s on the edge of mental collapse!” “To be on the edge” (edge) of something means to be almost in tha t situation – almost in that condition but not quite. “Mental” (mental) refers t o your mind. “Collapse” (collapse) is when something either falls down or b reaks down or no longer works the way it should. “Mental collapse” would be  someone who is no longer able to think rationally, who we might say “loses h is mind.” “To be on the edge of mental collapse” means that you are almost in that situation where you are no longer able to think rationally.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
