<P>
You are to simulate a game of Cops and Robbers.  In this game,
cops, robbers, and other citizens are
represented as points in a two-dimensional plane. A citizen is said to be
<EM>safe</EM> if it is within a triangle formed by three cops.  A citizen
is said to be <EM>robbed</EM> if it is not safe and is within a triangle
formed by three robbers.  A citizen is <EM>neither safe nor robbed</EM> if
it satisfies neither of the above conditions.
For purposes of this problem, a triangle consists of three
points, and a point is within a triangle if
it is inside or on the boundary of the triangle.
<P>
<P>
In the following diagram, filled circles represent cops, filled
squares represent robbers, and filled triangles represent citizens.
Dashed lines indicate triangles formed by cops or robbers

In this example, citizens A and B are safe, citizen C is robbed,
and citizen D is neither.
<P>
<P>
Given a set of cops and robbers and several citizen queries,
<B>efficiently</B> determine whether each citizen is safe, robbed, or neither.

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The input consists of several data sets.  The first line of each data
set contains three non-negative integers
<I>c</I>, <I>r</I>, and <I>o</I>:  the number of cops,
robbers, and other citizens, respectively.
<I>c</I>, <I>r</I>, and <I>o</I> will each be at most 200.  The next <I>c</I>
lines contain the (<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>) coordinates of each cop, one per line.
The next <I>r</I> lines contain the (<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>) coordinates
of each robber, one per line.  The next <I>o</I> lines contain
the (<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>) coordinates of each other citizen, one per line.
All coordinates are integers between -500 and 500
inclusive. 
<P>
<P>
Your program must stop processing
input when it encounters a data set in
which <I>c</I>, <I>r</I>, and <I>o</I> are all zero.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
Output for each data set begins with a line identifying the data
set.  For each other citizen in the data set, output the line
<P>
<P>
<P>
<TT>Citizen at (</TT><I>x</I>,<I>y</I><TT>) is </TT><I>status</I><TT>.</TT>
<P>
<P>
<P>
where (<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) is the location of the citizen from the input and <EM>status</EM>
is one of <TT>safe</TT>, <TT>robbed</TT> or <TT>neither</TT>.
Follow the format given in the Sample Output.  Leave a blank line after
the output from each data set.
