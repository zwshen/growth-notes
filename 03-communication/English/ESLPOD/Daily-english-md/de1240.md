This episode is a dialogue between Evelyn and Hank about giving someone the correct amount of money back when he pays you in ca sh. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Evelyn: If you want a job here as a cashier, you’ll  need to be able to give correct change.

Hank: Don’t you use a cash register here?

Evelyn: We do, but when it’s not working, we have t o be able to calculate change in our heads in a pinch.

Hank: Oh, I didn’t realize that.

Evelyn: Okay, let’s see how you do with a simple sa le. Let’s say I’m purchasing these two items and I’m paying with a $20 bill.

Hank: All right, give me a minute . . . the total i s $9.36.

Evelyn: Make sure you count back the change.

Hank: I’ve never done that before. I’m not sure I k now how.

Evelyn: Count up starting with the coins and workin g your way up to the paper money. Count out loud so the customer gets a runnin g total.

Hank: Okay, but first I have to do the math. The ch ange should be . . . Can I have a piece of paper to check my work? I don’t want to short the customer or give them too much change.

Evelyn: You won’t have time to do that with each cu stomer. Math wasn’t your favorite subject in school, was it?

Hank: You’re right about that. Maybe I need to work  on my math skills. In the meantime, I’m handy with a mop.

Evelyn: Good to hear. There’s a cleanup on aisle th ree that’s got your name all over it.

Evelyn begins our dialogue by saying to Hank, “If y ou want a job here as a cashier, you’ll need to be able to give correct cha nge.” A “cashier” (cashier) is a person whose job it is to take your money at a stor e where you are buying something. Now, you can pay for things in most Amer ican stores using a credit card, but many people buy things, especially things  that don’t cost very much money, in cash – that is, they pay for their items,  the things they are buying, with paper money and coins.

“To give correct change” means to, as a cashier, gi ve the correct amount of money back to someone who pays you with more money than what the item is worth. An example will make this clear. If you are buying a large coffee cup, like the ones that I use, and the cup costs $5.50, you m ay give the cashier $10 to pay for this coffee cup. The cashier then gives you bac k money. The correct change in this case would be $4.50, because $10 minus $5.5 0 (the cost of the cup) is $4.50. We call that amount of money you get back “c hange” (change).

So, Evelyn is telling Hank that he has to learn how  to give correct change. Hank asks, “Don’t you use a cash register here?” A “cash  register” (register) is a machine, nowadays usually a computer, that adds up the cost of everything a customer or a person buying something is buying and  tells you what the total amount is. A cash register will often usually tell you how much change to give back to a customer if the customer is paying with c ash. Notice that we call it a “cash register,” but it is used for people paying w ith credit cards as well as with cash.

Evelyn says, “We do,” meaning we do use a cash regi ster here, “but when it’s not working” – when it is not functioning properly – “w e have to be able to calculate

change in our heads in a pinch.” “To calculate” (ca lculate) means to perform a mathematical function with numbers, such as adding,  subtracting, multiplying, or dividing. “To do something in your head” means to d o it without writing anything down on a piece of paper or using a computer or oth er machine.

Most of us can add five plus five in our heads. We don’t need a piece of paper to calculate the answer, or at least I hope we don’t. “To do something in a pinch” (pinch) means to do something if it’s necessary in a difficult or challenging situation, meaning you wouldn’t normally have to do  it that way, but if it were required, you could do it that way. Hank responds, “Oh, I didn’t realize that,” meaning, I guess, he didn’t realize that sometimes the cash register doesn’t work.

Evelyn says, “Okay, let’s see how you do,” meaning let’s see how you perform, how you are able to give change back, “with a simpl e sale. Let’s say,” meaning let’s imagine, “I’m purchasing,” or buying, “these two items” – these two things – “and I’m paying with a $20 bill.” Hanks says, “All right, give me a minute,” meaning give me some time, a short amount of time t o think about it. Hank then says, “The total is $9.36.” “The total” means that’ s how much the two items that Evelyn has there cost together. Evelyn says, “Make sure you count back the change.” “To count back the change” means to say ou t loud, as you are giving the money back to the customer, how much that chang e is.

So, if a customer buys something for $9.36 and give s you a $20 bill, you count back the change by starting with the amount that the customer purchased, and each coin or each piece of currency – cash – you gi ve the customer, you say it out loud. So, if the customer buys something worth $9.36, you would first give the customer four pennies. You would go “Nine thirty-si x, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty,” then you would give the custom er a dime, worth 10 cents: “$9.50.”

Then you would give the customer two quarters, wort h 50 cents, and then you would say “Ten,” and then you would give the custom er a $10 bill and you would say “Twenty.” So, the total is $9.36, and you would  say, “Nine thirty-seven, thirty- eight, thirty-nine, forty, fifty, ten, and twenty.”  You are counting back the change to the customer. I worked in a store as a cashier f or seven years when I was in high school and college, so I got used to counting back change to the customer.

Hank says, “I’ve never done that before. I’m not su re I know how.” Evelyn says, “Count up starting with the coins and working your way up to the paper money. “To count up” means to start with the smallest numb er and gradually or slowly add to it. That’s what I did in my example. I “coun ted up” beginning with the total

of the sale, $9.36. First I gave the customer back the coins. A “coin” (coin) is a small, in the United States, round piece of metal t hat represents a certain amount of money.

In the U.S., we have the smallest coin, which is a penny. That’s worth 1 cent out of the 100 cents in a dollar. We also have a “nicke l” (nickel), worth 5 cents, a “dime” (dime), worth 10 cents, a “quarter” (quarter ), worth 25 cents. We do have a “50-cent coin,” but it’s not used very often. We also have a dollar coin, but again, it’s not used very often. In fact, I don’t t hink they make dollar coins anymore.

So, Evelyn tells Hank to “count up starting with the coins” and to work his way up, meaning to get up to a higher amount – in this case  to the paper money, what are called “paper bills” (bills). In the U.S., the most common paper bills you will see are $1 bills, $5 bills, $10 bills, and $20 bill s, although you will also see $50 bills and $100 bills.

Evelyn says, “Count out loud,” meaning so the perso n can hear you, “so the customer gets a running total.” A “running total” i s a total amount each time you add a new amount to what you are giving the custome r, just as I did when I gave my example of $9.37, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, for ty. That’s a running total. Hank says, “Okay, but first I have to do the math.” “To do the math” means the same as to calculate.

Hank says, “The change should be,” and then he stop s and says, “Can I have a piece of paper to check my work?” Hank wants a piec e of paper and a pencil or a pen to calculate on the piece of paper rather than doing it in his head. He says, “I don’t want to short the customer or give them” – hi m or her – “too much change.” “To short” (short) means to give the customer less money than you are supposed to give him. Of course you don’t want to short the customer. The customer might get very angry.

Evelyn says, “You won’t have time to do that with e ach customer,” meaning you’re not going to have time to take out a piece o f paper and calculate the change every time you have a customer. “Math wasn’t  your favorite subject in school, was it?” Evelyn asks. She’s making a joke. She’s saying that Hank isn’t very good at math, at mathematics. In British Engli sh they would say “maths” with an “s” on the end, but in U.S. English, we just say  “math” without the “s.” Hank says, “You’re right about that,” meaning no, math w asn’t my favorite subject in school.

He says, “Maybe I need to work on” – or to practice , to get better – “on my math skills. In the meantime, I’m handy with a mop.” “To  be handy” (handy) means to be able to do something well, especially some physi cal task. A “mop” (mop) is something you use to wash the floor. It has a long stick, and on the end of the stick there is either a sponge or a group of thick ropes that are used to clean the floor with water and some kind of soap. Hank is mak ing a little joke here. He’s saying that because he isn’t very good at math, may be he can do something else at that store. Maybe he can clean the floors.

Evelyn says, “Good to hear,” meaning that’s good to  know, that information is good for me to know. Then she says, “There’s a clea nup on aisle three that’s got your name all over it.” A “cleanup” (cleanup) – one  word – is a noun referring to something that needs to be cleaned up, that needs t o be picked up, usually because someone dropped it. If you go into a grocer y store, a place that sells food, sometimes people drop the containers of food on the floor and someone has to clean that up. That’s a “cleanup.”

An “aisle” (aisle) in this case refers to the area between the rows of food in a grocery store. Most grocery stores put cans and pac kages of food that don’t need to be in a refrigerator or freezer on shelves, and these shelves are placed in the store. In between the shelves is what is called an “aisle.” That’s where you can walk up and down in order to see the food on the sh elves. Evelyn says that there’s a “cleanup in aisle three,” meaning the thi rd aisle in the grocery store.

She says the cleanup has Hank’s name “all over it.”  To have your name “all over” something or “written all over” something means tha t it is something that is a good match for you, something that is intended for you. Evelyn is saying, in other words, that Hank would be a good person to clean up  the mess in aisle three, especially since he isn’t very good at math and the refore will not be a very good cashier.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
