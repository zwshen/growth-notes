<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As you should know, a <strong>formal system</strong>
consists of a set of <strong>axioms</strong> and set of inference or <strong>production
rules</strong>. Theorems, in general, are results that can be obtained upon the axioms and
the inference rules of the system. Deciding if a statement is a theorem of a given formal
system is not a trivial matter; in fact, for some systems it is not even possible, as we
know by Gödel's incompleteness theorem. </span></p>

<h2 CLASS="western"><font COLOR="#0070e8">The Problem</font></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">ME is a formal system with an infinite number of
axioms and just one production rule. There are only three symbols that may appear in any
axiom of ME: the capital letters M and E, and the symbol ?. In spite of the infinite
number of axioms, there is an easy way of identifying them:</span> 

<ul>
  <li><span lang="EN-GB"><b>Axiom definition:</b> An axiom of ME is a string of the form
    xM?Ex? where x is a string of </span>one<span lang="EN-GB"> or more ? symbols. </span></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Notice that the word xM?Ex? itself is not an
axiom, because x is not a valid symbol of ME; it is just a pattern to describe the axioms.
But ??M?E??? is indeed an axiom, because it fits the pattern, just replacing x with ??</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">There is another type of
valid strings in the system ME: the <i>theorems</i>. <b>Every axiom is a theorem of ME</b>.
In addition, the following production rule gives rise to an infinite number of theorems:</span>

<ul>
  <li><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt"><span dir="LTR"><b>P<span lang="EN-GB">roduction
    rule:</span> </b>If </span><span lang="EN-GB">xMyEz is a theorem then</span> <span
    lang="EN-GB">xMy?Ez?</span> <span lang="EN-GB">is also a theorem, where x,y,z</span> <span
    lang="EN-GB">are strings of </span>one<span lang="EN-GB"> or more ? symbols.</span></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For instance, the string ??M?E??? is a theorem,
because it is an axiom</span>, <span lang="EN-GB">and the string ??M??E???? is also a
theorem, since it can be obtained upon the theorem ??M?E??? and the production rule.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Can we decide if a given string is a theorem of ME? Sure!, there is a
decision algorithm for the system ME. But your goal is less general: just write a program
that reads strings with at most 50 symbols and decides if they are theorem of ME. </p>

<h2><font COLOR="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>

<p>The input begins with a single positive integer <em>N</em>, on a line by itself,
indicating the number of input lines following. Each input line contains <span
lang="EN-GB">a string with 1 to 50 </span>characters <span lang="EN-GB">(without spaces),
but not necessarily restricted to the symbols of ME. </span></p>

<h2><font COLOR="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>

<p>For each input line, the program must print an output line <span lang="EN-GB">with the
word <i>&quot;theorem</i><em>&quot;</em> if the </span>test<span lang="EN-GB"> line
contains a theorem, or </span>the word<span lang="EN-GB"> <i>&quot;no-theorem&quot; </i>in
other case.</span></p>
