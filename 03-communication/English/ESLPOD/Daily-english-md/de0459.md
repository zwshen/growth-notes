This episode is called “Watching Political Commentary Show s.”  These are news programs where there are people giving their opinions about politics – about things going on in the country, in the government.  The y’re very popular in the United States, especially in last 20 years they have become popular.  We’re going to listen to a dialogue between Laura and Joon that uses some common vocabulary you might hear or see used on one of these tel evision shows.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Laura:  I really don’t like these political commentary sh ows.  They purportedly present both sides of an issue, but the commentator is al ways biased. 

Joon:  Oh, I don’t think so.  Each show invites pundits on each side of the political spectrum.  In this show, for instance, the pundi ts each take turns presenting their arguments.   

Laura:  You mean they each present the party line, rig ht?  I find it so predictable what each side will say, since they always invite people who have opinions that are poles apart. 

Joon:  That’s not always true.  This other show has a roun dtable format.  Each person listens to the others and they debate the issues. 

Laura:  On that show, it’s not what they say, but how th ey say it.  They treat the others’ opinions with such contempt.  You can hear the l oathing in their voices and they constantly talk over each other.  I’m surprised you can bear to watch it.  

 Joon:  I find it stimulating.  I like a good fight. 

Laura:  I guess it’s better for them to do it on screen  than on the streets!

Our dialogue begins with Laura saying, “I don’t really like these political commentary shows.”  “Political” means relating to politi cs, what the government does – their policies, their actions.  “Commentary” mean s giving your opinion, or your view about something.  Laura says that these political  commentary shows purportedly present both sides of an issue, but the comm entator is always biased.  “Purportedly” means supposedly; it’s what someone says they are doing, but it usually isn’t true.  You could say, “She went int o his room purportedly to put away some clothes, but he thinks that she was looking for so mething.”  She said she was going in there to put away some clothes, but she w as really doing something else.   

These shows purportedly present, or give you both sides of an issue – give you different viewpoints about an issue, but the commentato r is always biased.  A “commentator” is a person who gives his or her opinion, u sually someone who is paid to give their opinion.  They can be either politi cally liberal (on the left), or politically conservative (on the right), or somewhere in between.  When we say someone is “biased,” we mean that they have a strong opin ion for or against something, so that you can’t really see anything but your o pinion.  Someone who is biased is usually someone who is not objective, someone wh o can’t look at the facts and determine something because they have their own strong opinions that already influence their views. 

Joon says, “Oh, I don’t think so (I don’t think the comme ntators are always biased).  Each show invites pundits on each side of the pol itical spectrum.”  A “pundit” (pundit) is a person who gives his or her opin ions about something, usually on a radio program or on a television show.  Th ere are several cable news networks that have political pundits, people giving t heir opinions on shows, and you can find lots and lots of these shows about Ame rican politics on American television.  The “political spectrum” is the rang e of opinions, from liberal on the left, to conservative that is on the righ t.  That’s the spectrum; it’s the range of different opinions.  Joon says, “In this show, t he pundits each take turns presenting their arguments.”  To “take turns” means tha t each person has an opportunity, they go from one to the other, then back t o the first, and then back to  

 the second, and so forth.  “Arguments,” here, means rea sons why you believe something.  The word “argument,” however, has a couple of different meanings in English; go to the Learning Guide for some additio nal explanations.   

Laura says, “You mean they each present the party line, r ight?”  The “party line” here means the official opinion or the generally accepte d ideas of a certain group.  Usually when we are talking about a political party people will use this term, the party line.  It also has the implication of being someone who doesn’t think for themselves, just repeats the opinions of the g roup that they belong to. But in any case, party line has to do with the accepted po sitions about certain things, opinions that a certain group has about, often , political issues.  Laura says, “I find it so predictable what each side will say.”  When you say something is “predictable,” you mean you know what is going to ha ppen, you already know their opinion before they tell you – you can predict it.   She says, “they always invite people who have opinions that are poles apart.”  The expression “poles apart” here means very different from one another.  S omeone very conservative and someone very liberal would be poles apart. 

Joon says, “That’s not always true.  This other show has a ro undtable format.”  A “roundtable” (one word) is a type of meeting or discussio n where people sit around a table and each person talks for a short amount time.  It’s more like a conversation.  Joon says in this roundtable, each person liste ns to the others and they debate the issues.  To “debate” means to talk about  what you think and the reasons why you think that. 

Laura says, “On that show, it’s not what they say, it’s ho w they say it.  They treat the others’ opinions with such contempt.”  “Contempt” i s a feeling that someone or something isn’t important and you do not need to re spect it.  It’s a feeling of disgust, we would say.  If someone says, “She was treated w ith contempt,” they mean that the other persons didn’t respect her and they treated her badly.  Laura says that you can hear the loathing in their voices and the y constantly talk over each other.  To “loathe” (loathe) means to hate, to r eally dislike something, not to like something.  “Loathing” means hatred of something,  not liking something. She says, “You can hear the loathing (the dislike, their hatred) in their voices and they constantly talk over each other.”  To “talk over (someo ne)” means to speak loudly before the other person is finished talking.  Yo u’re trying to basically stop the other person from talking by speaking loudly so that t hey will listen to you, or someone else will listen to you.  This is very common on t hese political commentary shows; people are almost shouting or yelling at  each other about some political topic.    

 Laura says, “I’m surprised you can bear to watch it.”  T o “bear to watch it” means that you are able to watch it because it is so difficult; it is so painful, perhaps. Joon says, “I find it stimulating.”  Something that is “st imulating” is something that is exciting, something that is interesting, something tha t makes you think about a topic in a new or different way.  Joon says, “I like a goo d fight,” when two people are arguing or disagreeing with each other.  Laura says,  “I guess it’s better for them to do it on screen than on the streets!”  So she ’s saying I guess it’s better for them to fight each other on the television.  The e xpression “on screen” means either on your television or on a movie screen – a place where you watch movies.  It’s better for them to do it on TV then to f ight in the streets.  The idea here is that if you fight in the streets it’s often a ph ysical fight, where you’re punching and hitting the other person. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
