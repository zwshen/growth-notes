This episode is a dialogue between Ron and Marcela.   It is about the kinds of business organizations – the legal ways of organizi ng your business in the United States, what we call “business entities.”  Let’s ge t started.

[start of dialogue]

Ron:  I’m only your tax accountant, but let me give  you a piece of advice.  If you’re planning to start a business, you’ll want to  carefully consider what type of business entity you want to do business under.

Marcela:  Is that important?  My parents ran a mom- and-pop store for 40 years and they never had to think about stuff like that.

Ron:  I don’t know about your parents’ business, bu t opening a store these days means having to think about the tax implications an d liability issues.

Marcela:  Liability issues?

Ron:  Yes.  What if somebody sues you?  Without pro per safeguards, a lawsuit could bankrupt you and your business.

Marcela:  I’d never thought of that.

Ron:  You’ll probably want to consider forming a co rporation or an LLC.  You’ll be a sole proprietor, right?  You’re not going into bu siness with someone else, are you?

Marcela:  I’ll have two partners actually.

Ron:  In that case, you’ll also want to think about  things like the transferring of interests and the duration of the entity.

Marcela:  Wow, starting a business is a lot more co mplicated than I thought.

Ron:  My advice?  Get a lawyer, and the sooner the better!

Ron begins by saying to Marcela, “I’m only your tax  accountant, but let me give you a piece of advice.”  An “accountant” is someone  takes care of your financial records, who makes sure that you are keeping track of what you spend and what you make.  Usually accountants prepare tax returns – tax forms for the government for your business.  He, Ron, is a “tax a ccountant.”  It’s a person who specializes in looking at the tax situation for a b usiness.  He’s going to give Marcela a piece of advice.  A “piece of advice” is really the same as a sentence or one statement of advice – one idea.  He says, “I f you’re planning to start a business (if you plan to start a business), you’ll want to carefully consider what type of business entity you want to do business und er.”  “Business entity” is the way the business is structured legally, the way tha t it is recognized legally, usually requiring some sort of registration with the government but not always.

Marcela says, “Is that important?  My parents ran a  mom-and-pop store for 40 years and they never had to think about stuff like that.”  “Mom and pop” stands for mother and father.  “Pop” is an informal way of  referring to your father – your dad.  “Mom-and-pop” businesses are owned by a marri ed couple – a husband and a wife.  Often, the term is used to describe fa mily-owned businesses, businesses that perhaps the parents own and the chi ldren work in, for example. Marcela says that her parents had a mom-and-pop sto re and they never thought about business entities.

Ron says, “I don’t know about your parents’ busines s, but opening a store these days (meaning nowadays; today) means having to thin k about the tax implications and liability issues.”  The way you or ganize your business has two important consequences.  One is tax implications.  “Implication” is really another name for consequences, what will happen as a result  of what you do.  “Tax” refers to the money you have to pay the government for the money that you make – the profits that you make.  “Liability” has to do with whether something goes wrong, and if it does who’s going to pay for i t.  If a customer is in your store and they fall and hurt themselves, you, as the owne r of the store, might be liable; you might have to pay for their injury.  They may s ue you, they may go to court –

to the legal system and try to get money from you.  All of these things are related to the general concept of liability, who’s responsi ble.

Marcela says, “Liability issues?”  Ron says, “Yes.  What if,” or imagine – “What if somebody sues you?”  “To sue” (sue), as I mentioned , is to take someone to court, to the legal system and demand that they giv e you money because they did something wrong to you.  The word “sue” has oth er meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional ex planations.  Ron says, “Without proper safeguards, a lawsuit could bankrup t you and your business.”  A “safeguard” (safeguard – one word) is something tha t you do to protect yourself in case something bad happens.  We might also call it a “precaution.”  For example, I buy trip insurance – I buy travel insura nce before I go on a long vacation.  In case there’s problem with the plane o r something goes wrong, the insurance will pay me for the money I have lost.  T hat is an example of a safeguard.  Ron says, “Without proper (or correct) safeguards, a lawsuit could bankrupt you.”  A “lawsuit” (lawsuit – one word) is  the legal process of suing you, of taking you to court, to the legal system and dem anding money.  That whole process is called a lawsuit.  “To bankrupt (someone )” means to have the business or the person go to the government and say , “I don’t have any more money,” and this gives you a certain protection aga inst people who are asking or demanding money from you.  However, normally the te rm “bankrupt,” in the context that we’re hearing it here, refers to a fai lure of your business, that your business will lose money and that you will lose you r business in effect.  It has a legal term – a legal definition, rather, but more g enerally to bankrupt something or someone means that they are financially ruined.  It’s a disaster for them; they may lose their business, and so forth.

Marcela said, “I’d never thought of that.”  Ron say s, “You’ll probably want to consider forming a corporation or an LLC.”  So, the re are different types of business entities that are popular or common in the  United States.  One of the most common is a corporation.  A “corporation” is a  company that is legally separated from its owners in a way that protects the owners in case there’s a problem in the business.  Technically, the corporat ion is like another person legally, and typically in a corporation you have pe ople who own parts of the corporation, what we call “shareholders,” they own a part of the corporation. Sometimes the corporation is public and you can buy  a part of the company; anyone can buy a part of the company.  Big companie s like Google and Apple and Microsoft are what we call “public” corporation s; anyone can be part owner by buying what are called “shares,” or stock in the  company.  If the company – the corporation gets sued, the personal wealth of t he people who are part owners are not at risk.  That is, let’s say you have a com pany that has 100,000 dollars, and each of the shareholders has 200,000 dollars in  their bank account.  Well, if

you sue the corporation, the corporation only has t o pay from the 100,000 dollars.  It doesn’t affect the individual sharehol ders – the individual owners; their 200,000 dollars in the bank is not something that y ou can get from the company. So, the corporation separates the financial interes ts – the financial matters of the business from the financial matters of the individu al person.

A kind of corporation is called “limited liability corporation,” that’s what an “LLC” is.  Normally, we use the abbreviation “LLC.”  An L LC is a kind of business that is like a corporation, but it’s also alike another kin d of business entity, a partnership. A “partnership” is when two people or a small group  of people get together and decide that each person will own part of the busine ss, but a partnership doesn’t have the same legal protections as a corporation do es.  So, the LLC is sort of a combination of a corporation and a partnership.

Ron says, “You’ll be a sole proprietor, right?”  A “sole proprietor” is someone who owns the business, but doesn’t have any separate le gal organization for the business, so that if there’s a problem both his or her personal finances as well as the business finances can be at risk; you could sue  them.  There’s no protection for what we would call your personal “assets,” the money and other valuable things that you own personally.  So, proprietorship s do not have the same protections as corporations and LLCs.

Ron says, “You’re not going into business with some one else, are you?”  “To go into business with” means to open a business with s omeone else.  Marcela says, “I’ll have two partners actually.”  Once again, a “ partner” is someone who agrees to work with you on the business and own the busine ss with you.  Ron says, “In that case (in that situation), you’ll also want to think about things like the transferring of interests and the duration of the e ntity.”  “To transfer interests” is to give or sell your ownership in something to anot her person.  So let’s say you have two partners, and they start a business togeth er, and then one says, “Eh, I don’t really like this business; I want to leave.”  You need to have some process – some agreement about how that person can sell the ir interests in the company. Their “interests” are the things that they have inv ested, the money that they have in the company.  “Duration” has to do with how long  something lasts.  So the duration of a partnership would be determined by the agreement; you might decide we’re going to be partners for five years an d then we’ll decide what to do then.

Marcela says, “Wow, starting a business is a lot mo re complicated than I thought.”  Ron says, “My advice?  Get a lawyer, and  the sooner the better!”  A “lawyer” is another word for an attorney, someone w ho has legal expertise – someone who’s a legal expert.  He says, “Get a lawy er, and the sooner the

better!” meaning the faster that you get the lawyer  the better it will be for you; don’t wait, get one as soon as possible.

So that’s a little bit about business entities in t he United States.  Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal rate of speed.
