<P>
County General Hospital is trying to chart its course through the troubled
waters of the economy and shifting population demographics.  To support the
planning requirements of the hospital, you have been asked to develop a
simulation program that will allow the hospital to evaluate alternative
configurations of operating rooms, recovery rooms and operations guidelines.
Your program will monitor the usage of operating rooms and recovery room beds
during the course of one day.
<P>
County General Hospital has several operating rooms and recovery room beds.
Each surgery patient is assigned to an available operating room and following
surgery the patient is assigned to one of the recovery room beds.  The amount
of time necessary to transport a patient from an operating room to a recovery
room is fixed and independent of the patient. Similarly, both the amount of
time to prepare an operating room for the next patient and the amount of time
to prepare a recovery room bed for a new patient are fixed.
<P>
<P>
All patients are officially scheduled for surgery at the same time, but the
order in which they actually go into the operating rooms depends on the order
of the patient roster. A patient entering surgery goes into the lowest
numbered operating room available. For example, if rooms 2 and 4 become
available simultaneously, the next patient on the roster not yet in surgery
goes into room 2 and the next after that goes into room 4 at the same time.
After surgery, a patient is taken to the available recovery room bed with the
lowest number. A recovery room bed is only 
available if the preparation is already finished when the patient leaves 
surgery. If two patients emerge from surgery at the same time, the patient with 
the lower surgery room number will be the first assigned to a recovery 
room bed.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The input file contains data for several simulation runs. Each run is separated by a blank line.  All numeric data
in the input file are integers, and successive integers on the same line are
separated by blanks.  The first line of each run is the set of hospital
configuration parameters to be used for this run.  The parameters are, in
order:
<PRE><TT> 
		   Number of operating rooms  (maximum of 10)
<P>
		   Number of recovery room beds  (maximum of 30)
<P>
		   Starting hour for 1st surgery of day (based on a 24-hour clock)
<P>
		   Minutes to transport patient from operating room to recovery room
<P>
		   Minutes to prepare operating room for next patient
<P>
		   Minutes to prepare recovery room bed for next patient
<P>
		   Number of surgery patients for the day   (maximum of 100)
<P>
</TT></PRE>
This initial configuration data will be followed by pairs of lines of
patient data as follows:
<PRE><TT> 
		 Line 1:  Last name of patient (maximum of 8 characters)
<P>
		 Line 2:  Minutes required for surgery Minutes required in the recovery room
<P>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
Patient records in the input file are ordered according to the patient roster,
which determines the order in which patients are scheduled for surgery.  The
number of recovery room beds specified in any configuration will be sufficient
to handle patients arriving from surgery (No queuing of patients for recovery
room beds will be required). Computed times will not extend past 24:00.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
Correct output shows which operating room and which recovery room bed is
used by each patient, and the time period that the patient uses the room and
bed along with a summary of the utilization of hospital facilities for that
day.  The output file consists of several sets of two tables each describing the results
of the simulation run.  The first table is in columnar form with appropriate
column labels to show the number of each patient (in the order the patient
roster), the patient's last name, the operating room number, the time surgery
begins and ends, the recovery bed number and the time the patient enters and
leaves the recovery room bed.
<P>
The second table will also be in columnar form with appropriate column
labels summarizing the utilization of operating rooms and recovery room beds.
This summary indicates the facility type (room or bed), the facility number,
the number of minutes used and percentage of available time utilized.
Available time is defined as the time in minutes from the starting time for
1<I>st</I> surgery of day to the ending time of the last patient in a recovery room
bed.
Print a blank line after each run. Follow the output format shown on sample output.
