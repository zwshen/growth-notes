This episode is called “Getting a Performance Evalu ation,” this is related to your job or work, where your boss sits down with you and  talks to you about how you have been doing – how your work has been, how your performance has been. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Emil:  Have a seat.  As you know, we need to talk a bout your annual performance evaluation.  Is there anything you’d li ke to say before we get started? 

Sandra:  Yes, there is.  I’ve tried really hard thi s year to improve on some of the shortcomings identified in my evaluation last year.    

Emil:  Hmm, I’m afraid that’s not reflected in this  year’s evaluation.  Your supervisor noted on the report that you’ve been per forming below par for several months now, and your productivity is down, too. 

Sandra:  I can’t imagine why she would say that.  I f I haven’t excelled on the new project, I’ve at least pulled my weight.  I don’t t hink she can fault me on that. 

Emil:  On the contrary, she thinks that you’ve been  slacking off and not giving 100 percent.   

Sandra:  I have had some personal issues, but I did n’t think they had been affecting my work.  I guess I’ve let them bring dow n my performance. 

Emil:  This was a hard decision, but we’re putting you on probation for the next three months.  You’ll have another evaluation at th e end of that time.  If your performance isn’t up to par by that time, we’ll hav e to think about letting you go.  

 Sandra:  That won’t happen.  I’m going to pull out all the stops to prove myself. 

Emil:  Good.  That’s what I wanted to hear. 

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with the Emil saying, “Have a s eat,” meaning please sit down.  He’s talking to Sandra, who is one of his em ployees (someone who works for him).  Emil says, “As you know, we need to talk  about your annual performance evaluation.”  The “performance evaluati on” is a written or spoken report about how well you have done on your job, us ually done every six months or one year; “annual” would be every year. 

Emil says, “Is there anything you’d like to say bef ore we get started?”  Sandra says, “Yes, there is.  I’ve tried really hard this year to improve on some of the shortcomings identified in my evaluation last year. ”  “Shortcomings” are things that you don’t do very well, things that you should  be able to do better, something that is less than perfect.  Not always are shortcom ings things that you can change, but here I think Sandra is talking about th ings that she can do better, things that are less than perfect. 

Emil says, “Hmm, I’m afraid that’s not reflected in  this year’s evaluation.”  “To be reflected,” here, means to, in this case, to be see n; something that is obvious, something that he is able to see and look at, that her changes, in other words, have not really been seen in the evaluation.  The e valuation says she hasn’t changed.  The verb “reflect” has a number of differ ent meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations .  Emil says, “Your supervisor (your immediate boss) noted on the repor t that you’ve been performing below par for several months now, and yo ur productivity is down, too.”  The expression “below par” (par) comes from the sport of golfing; in general usage, it means less than expected, less th an average, not as good as it should be.  There’s a similar expression, “on par,”  which means that it is as good as it should be, it’s right where it ought to be.  But “below par” means that it is less than what it should be.  Emil says that Sandra ’s productivity is down. “Productivity” is, in general, the ability to do a certain amount of work in a certain period of time.  If we say that someone’s productiv ity is down, we mean they are not doing as much work, they are not as productive.  

Sandra says, “I can’t imagine why she (her supervis or) would say that.”  She’s surprised, in other words.  Sandra says, “If I have n’t excelled on the new project, I’ve at least pulled my weight.”  “To excel” (excel ) means to do something very  

well, better than anyone expected.  She’s saying th at even if she did not excel on the project she’s working on, she at least pulled h er weight.  “To pull your weight” means to do the work that you are expected to do as  part of a group – as part of a team.  Everyone has their job to do in the group;  “to pull your weight” means to do what you are supposed to do.  Sandra is saying t hat well yes, I haven’t done a great job, but I’ve done what I was supposed to do.   She says, “I don’t think she can fault me on that.”  To fault (someone) on (some thing)” means to criticize or say negative things about something that someone ha s done.  To fault someone means to blame someone.  She’s saying here that she  did her work so that her supervisor can’t criticize her for that – can’t fau lt her on that. 

Emil says, “On the contrary, she thinks that you’ve  been slacking off and not giving 100 percent.”  So Sandra’s supervisor, who i s not at the meeting (Sandra is meeting with her higher boss, Emil), says that S andra has been slacking off. “To slack (slack) off” is a two-word phrasal verb m eaning to be lazy, not to work very hard, not to do what you are supposed to do.  A phrasal verb is a verb that has more than one word, so “slack off” is a two-wor d verb.  That’s a phrasal verb, in case you were wondering.   

In this case, Sandra has been slacking off accordin g to her supervisor, being lazy and not giving 100 percent.  “To give 100 percent” means to work as hard as you can, to do your very best.  Sandra now tries to pro vide an excuse, a reason perhaps why her supervisor might have said what she  did.  She says, “I have had some personal issues,” things that are not related to work such as family or friends.  She’s had some personal issues – some per sonal problems, but she didn’t think they had been affecting her work.  She  says, “I guess I’ve let them bring down my performance.”  “To bring down” is a t wo-word phrasal verb meaning to reduce, to decrease, to make something l ess or perhaps smaller. “To bring down your productivity” means to lower it , to make it less than it was before.  “To bring down” can also mean to depress a nother person, to make another person feel sad.  There was a song in the l ate 70s, Don’t Bring Me Down – don’t depress me. 

Emil says, “This was a hard decision, but we’re put ting you on probation for the next three months.”  “Probation” is a period when y ou are being tested to decide whether or not they are going to keep you or let yo u go – fire you, in this case.  A probationary period is a trial period; it’s when yo u are testing someone.  In this case, she is going to be on probation for three mon ths.  Then, Emil says, “You’ll have another evaluation at the end of that time (at  the end of three months).  If your performance isn’t up to par by that time, we’l l have to think about letting you go.”  “Up to par” is another one of those expressio ns coming from golf, meaning to be at the level we expect.  It’s the same as “on  par.”  So she must improve her  

performance, if not, they may have to let her go.  “To let (someone) go” is a nice way of saying to fire someone.  Another way to say that would be “to lay (someone) off,” causing someone to lose their job. 

Sandra says, “That won’t happen,” meaning she will improve her performance; it will not be below par.  “I’m going to pull out all the stops to prove myself.”  “To pull out all the stops (or ‘all of the stops’)” mea ns to do something as hard as possible, as much as possible, as quickly as possib le, to put all your effort into something.  The term, I believe, originally comes f rom the playing of the organ, which is a instrument that is very loud, often foun d in churches.  “To pull out all the stops” means to make the organ as loud as possi ble.  Here it means that Sandra is going to work as hard she can to prove he rself.  “To prove yourself” means to show that you can do something well, to sh ow that you are worth something, that you should be considered for someth ing.  Sandra needs to prove herself, she needs to demonstrate – to show her bos s that they should keep her and not let her go. 

Emil says, “Good.  That’s what I wanted to hear,” I  want to hear that you’re going to try to improve. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
