# Meeting the Future In-laws

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 278: Meeting the Future In-laws.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 278.  I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Remember to visit our website at eslpod.com, and download a Learning Guide for this episode.    This episode is called “Meeting the Future In-laws.”  Your “in-laws” are the relatives of your wife or husband.  Let's get started.  > Atsushi:  I don’t mind telling you that I’m really nervous about meeting your parents.  Scarlet:  You look like you’re about to face the firing squad.  It’s not going to be that bad.  Atsushi:  I wish I could believe that.  I’m going to try to make a good first impression, but I don’t think they’re going to like the fact that I’m a professional musician.    Scarlet:  I’ve already told them about you, so there won’t be any surprises.    Atsushi:  It doesn’t help that your last boyfriend was a straight-laced college student.  Couldn’t you have dated a convict before me?  I’d look pretty good to your parents in comparison.    Scarlet:  How do you know I didn’t?  You don’t know everything about me.  Atsushi:  Very funny.  Maybe we should postpone this visit with your parents for a little while.  Scarlet:  No!     Atsushi:  I’m just putting it out there.
