This episode is a dialogue between Julio and his mo ther, who apparently doesn’t like to get rid of things – even things she doesn’t  need anymore. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Julio: Mom, don’t you think it’s time to get rid of  some of the stuff in this house?

Mom: Why? This house is fine the way it is.

Julio: There are parts of this house that are nearl y inaccessible. There are stacks of magazines and bags and boxes everywhere.

Mom: I need all that stuff. You know I’ve always be en a pack rat.

Julio: I know, but I think things are getting out of hand. You have stuff on every surface and you can’t find anything in here.

Mom: You can’t find anything, but I can put my hand s on anything I want at any time. I collect and keep useful things, unlike you young people these days who throw away perfectly good things just because you d on’t need them this minute.

Julio: I think your hoarding is becoming compulsive .

Mom: That’s nonsense. Just because you prefer livin g in a sterile environment doesn’t mean I have to. I don’t mind a little clutt er.

Julio: A little clutter?! You have junk mail from 1 5 years ago!

Mom: You never know when something will come in han dy. Now, don’t you have some room in your garage where I can store a few ex tra boxes?

 Julio: No, I don’t!

This episode is called “Living with a Hoarder” (hoa rder). “To hoard” means to collect things, usually things that you don’t need anymore but don’t want to throw out. A “hoarder” is usually someone who collects so  much of something that they don’t have room for anything else. Their house begi ns to fill up with things. Some people hoard only certain kinds of objects; other p eople hoard everything. They don’t like to throw anything out.

You can also use this verb “to hoard” when you are buying a lot of something because you think that in the future there perhaps won’t be any of that thing. If I think, for example, that the price of, say, rice is  going to go up in the future, and/or that perhaps there won’t be any rice availab le to buy in the stores, I might decide to go to the store and buy a hundred bags of  rice. I would hoard the rice. I would keep them until I needed them. In this instan ce, however, we’re talking about someone who keeps things that they don’t need .

Julio begins by saying, “Mom, don’t you think it’s time to get rid of,” to throw out, “some of the stuff in this house” – some of the thi ngs in this house. His mother says, “Why?” The house is fine “the way it is.” Eve rything is fine, she says. Julio, however, says “There are parts of this house that a re nearly inaccessible.” The prefix “in-” often means “not.” So, “inaccessible” means not accessible. “Accessible” means you can get there. You can reach  a certain place. Something that is “inaccessible” is something that you cannot  get to, you cannot reach.

Julio says, “There are stacks of magazines and bags  and boxes everywhere.” A “stack” is a vertical pile. It’s a lot of things pu t on top of each other. You could have a stack of papers, or a stack of newspapers. A  stack of newspapers would be one newspaper on top of another newspaper on top  of another newspaper, and so on. Julio is complaining about the stacks of  magazines and bags and boxes in his mother’s house.

His mother says, “I need all that stuff. You know I ’ve always been a pack rat.” A “pack (pack) rat (rat)” is a person who likes to co llect many things and not get rid of anything. It’s quite similar to a hoarder. Julio  says, “I know, but I think things are getting out of hand.” The expression “to get ou t of hand” means that the situation is becoming uncontrollable. It’s becoming  so extreme, so difficult, that we won’t be able to handle it. We won’t be able to manage it.

Julio says, “You have stuff on every surface and yo u can’t find anything in here.” We use the word “surface” to describe the top of a table or of a shelf or of any flat object that you can put something on top of. Mom sa ys, “You can’t find anything, but I can put my hands on anything I want at any ti me.” Julio’s mother says that maybe he can’t find things in her house, but she ca n. She says, “I can put my hands on anything I want.” “To put your hands on” s omething here means to locate something, to find something. She says she can find whatever she wants.

“I collect and keep useful things, unlike you young  people these days who throw away perfectly good things just because you don’t n eed them this minute.” Mom says she collects and keeps useful things. “To coll ect” means to get a lot of the same item, the same thing. She complains that “youn g people these days” – meaning nowadays, in the present time – “throw away  perfectly good things.” They get rid of perfectly good things. The use of the word “perfectly” here means completely, entirely. It’s really used for emphasis : these are really good things.

Why do young people throw them away, according to J ulio’s mother? “Just because they don’t need them this minute.” She’s sa ying that young people throw things away whenever they don’t need them, ev en if they may need them in the future. That’s the implication of the phrase  “this minute.” “This minute” means right now, at this exact point in time, not in the future – not tomorrow, not next week – but right now. Sometimes a parent angry  at his or her daughter or son might say, “I want you here this minute.” The p arent means immediately.

Although it has other meanings that we explained ea rlier, “hoarding” nowadays often describes people who collect so many things, have so many things in their house, that it becomes perhaps even dangerous to go  in the house because it’s so full of stuff. Julio thinks his mom’s hoarding is becoming compulsive. “Compulsive” (compulsive) means you are unable to s top doing something, often because of some psychological or mental problem. the implication of this word is that perhaps the person isn’t responsible for his o wn behavior. The person can’t help, can’t prevent himself, from doing that activi ty.

Mom says, “That’s nonsense.” She says that’s wrong.  That’s incorrect. “Just because you prefer living in a sterile environment doesn’t mean I have to.” “Sterile” (sterile) means, in this case, very “bare ” (bare) – very clean, very empty, without anything unnecessary present. “Sterile” is often used in the medical field at hospitals and clinics to describe an environment  where there aren’t any germs or bacteria or things that could make you sick. We talk about “sterilizing instruments” before surgery; before a doctor cuts i nto you with a knife, the knife is sterilized. It’s made clean so that it doesn’t h ave anything that might make you even more sick.

 In our dialogue, the mother is describing a place that doesn’t have hardly anything in it, and because of that wouldn’t be ver y comfortable. She says, “I don’t mind a little clutter.” “Clutter” (clutter) r efers to things, objects, that take up a lot of space and are not organized in any way. If y ou look at my desk, for example, you’ll see a lot of clutter – papers here and papers there – not very neat, not very organized. My wife can’t even look a t my desk at home. She doesn’t like it. It bothers her because she likes e verything to be very neat, very organized. Anyway, enough of me and back to our dia logue.

Julio says, “A little clutter? You have junk mail f rom 15 years ago.” “Junk (junk) mail” is mail that is sent to you that you don’t re ally want or didn’t request. Julio’s mom says, “You never know when something will come in handy.” “To come in handy” (handy) means to be useful, to be something that might be helpful. “Now,” Mom says, “don’t you have some room in your garage where I can store a few extra boxes?” Julio’s mother is asking him if he ca n take a couple of her boxes of things and store them in his garage. “To store” as a verb means to keep something in a place until you need it sometime in the future.

Julio does not want to store any of his mother’s st uff. So, he says, “No, I don’t,” meaning no, I don’t have any room in my garage to s tore your boxes. A “garage” is normally a place where you put your car, but man y Americans park their cars outside and put things in their garage that they wa nt to keep but they don’t need right away. They store things in their garages.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
