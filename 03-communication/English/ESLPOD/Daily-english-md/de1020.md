This episode is a dialogue between Omar and Faith a bout making mistakes when you peak – I mean, speak. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Omar: Ha-ha.

Faith: What’s so funny?

Omar: I’m editing Paul’s speech so that it can be p osted on our website, but I didn’t realize how many verbal mistakes he made.

Faith: Were there a lot?

Omar: Yeah, he mispronounced the last name of the m anager in charge of new products, for one. He also stumbled over the name of the new products.

Faith: I did notice that he had a few problems with  delivery.

Omar: That’s putting it lightly. He stuttered when trying to list the products’ features. It’s true that some of the verbiage was w ritten like tongue twisters, but I thought he would have had it down cold by now.

Faith: I noticed he made a few slips of the tongue,  but I didn’t notice all that. I guess I wasn’t listening too closely. But what were  you laughing about when I walked in?

Omar: Paul made a Freudian slip. Instead of saying that “innovation is our bread and butter,” he said that it was our “bed and butte r.” Maybe that’s why he had so many flubs. His mind was elsewhere.

Faith: I think you’ll have plenty of material for a  blooper reel.

Omar: That’s true. In fact, if this were a film, I’ d have more outtakes than usable footage!

Our dialogue begins with Omar laughing. Faith asks him, “What’s so funny?” Notice, she could have said, “What’s funny?” but in  this situation, it would be more common to say, “What’s so funny?” meaning “Wha t are you laughing at? What do you think is so funny that you are laughing ?”

Omar says, “I’m editing Paul’s speech so that it ca n be posted on our website, but I didn’t realize how many verbal mistakes he ma de.” The word “verbal” (verbal) means with spoken words. We might also say  “oral” (oral). “Verbal” or “oral” means that you say it, not write it. So, Oma r seems to be the video editor for this company, and he’s noticing a lot of mistak es in one of the videos. He’s editing a video of someone named Paul who is giving  a speech.

Faith says, “Were there a lot?” meaning were there a lot of verbal mistakes. Omar says, “Yeah. He mispronounced the last name of  the manager in charge of new products, for one.” “To mispronounce” is to pro nounce something or say something incorrectly, using the wrong sounds. “For  one” at the end of this sentence means for example, for instance. It’s a ph rase we use when we are saying this is just one of many examples I could gi ve you.

Omar says, “He mispronounced the last name of the m anager in charge of” – or responsible for – “new products, for one.” The idea  is that he committed other mistakes as well. Omar says, “He also stumbled over  the name of the new products.” “To stumble (stumble) over” something is  a phrasal verb meaning not to do very well at. “To stumble over” can also mean  to be walking along and hit your foot on something and begin to fall. That is l iterally “to stumble over” something. Here it’s used more to mean to make a mi stake, especially when you’re saying something – to have difficulty saying  something.

Don’t confuse this with another phrasal verb, “to s tumble on,” or “to stumble upon” (upon). That means to find something that you  think is valuable or

interesting even though you weren’t actually lookin g for it. Omar says that poor Paul “stumbled over the name of the new products” f or this company.

Faith says, “I did notice that he had a few problem s with delivery.” “Delivery” (delivery) here means the way that you present info rmation. When we talk about the “delivery” of the speech, we’re talking about h ow the speech was given – whether you used the right intonation or you made the speech interesting.

Omar says, “That’s putting it lightly.” Faith says that she noticed “a few problems” with Paul’s delivery of his speech. Omar says it wa s more than a few problems. That’s why he says, “That’s putting it lightly.” Wh en someone says, “That’s putting it lightly” (lightly), or “that’s putting it mildly” (mildly), he means that you are understating the problem. You are making the pr oblem less serious than it really is. You’re perhaps being kind to this person  by not indicating just how bad things were.

Omar says that Paul “stuttered when trying to list the products’ features.” “To stutter” (stutter) is to repeat the first sound of a word – not intentionally, but because perhaps you have some sort of difficulty in  speaking, or perhaps just because you’re very nervous. When someone says, “I,  w-went to the s-store,” that’s stuttering. Paul “stuttered when trying to l ist,” or give a list of, “the products’ features” – the things that the products had or the  things that the products offered.

Omar says, “It’s true that some of the verbiage was  written like tongue twisters, but I thought he would have had it down cold by now .” There are several words and expressions there. Let’s begin with “verbiage” (verbiage). “Verbiage” refers to writing or speaking that contains too many words , that is often confusing or difficult to understand because the person is using  lots of different words – perhaps to confuse you or perhaps because he doesn’ t really know what he’s saying, and so he’s just saying something.

“Verbiage” might also be applied to a text or a spe ech that had a lot of technical terms. We’re not sure which is the case here. Omar says, “It’s true that some of the verbiage was written like tongue twisters.” A “  tongue twister” (twister) is a phrase that is difficult to say, usually because there are lots of different words that have similar sounds. These are things that som etimes children like to say as a game.

An example would be, “She sells sea shells on the s eashore.” If you try to say that very fast, you’ll probably make a mistake in p ronouncing it. The importance is not the meaning of the sentence. The sentence is  about a woman who is

selling “shells” – things that you find on the beac h of an ocean – on the “seashore,” which is basically the edge of the ocea n, the edge of the sea. In any case, the important thing about a tongue twister is  that it’s difficult to pronounce. “Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.” Tha t’s another tongue twister, which I probably got wrong.

Anyway, Omar says that some of the speech that Paul  was reading was written like tongue twisters, meaning it was difficult to p ronounce or difficult to say. “But,” Omar says, “I thought he would have had it down col d by now.” “To have something down cold” means to have it memorized, to  know it perfectly so that you don’t make any mistakes.

Faith then says, “I noticed he made a few slips of the tongue, but I didn’t notice all that.” Once again, Faith doesn’t think that Pau l’s problems were as serious as what Omar is describing. She says, “I noticed he ma de a few slips (slips)  of the tongue.” A “slip of the tongue” is a mistake, somet hing you say accidentally that you didn’t mean to say. Faith says, “I guess I wasn ’t listening too closely,” or very closely. “But what were you laughing about when I w alked in?”

Omar says, “Paul made a Freudian slip.” A “Freudian  (Freudian) slip” is a mistake that indicates what you were really thinkin g about – when someone says something and they say the wrong words that indicat e (or at least, we think they indicate) what the person was really thinking about . “Freudian” obviously comes from the last name of the famous psychiatrist Sigmu nd Freud of the early twentieth century. “Paul made a Freudian slip,” acc ording to Omar, and Omar tells us what that slip or mistake was.

Omar says, “Instead of saying that ‘innovation’ is our bread and butter,’ he said that it was our ‘bed and butter.’” So, Omar says th at Paul was supposed to say the expression, or the phrase, “innovation is our b read and butter.” “Innovation” is coming up with new things. The expression “bread an d butter” is actually quite common in English. It means the way that you make a  living – the way that you make money to live, to survive. It may also refer to a company’s most successful product because that’s the product, the thing the c ompany sells, that makes the most money for the company.

Omar says that Paul was supposed to say “bread and butter,” but instead says “bed (bed) and butter.” Paul says “bed” instead of “bread.” Often Freudian slips are associated with something perhaps sexual, and t hat’s probably why Omar calls this a Freudian slip. Maybe Omar was thinking  about his bed – perhaps going to sleep – rather than the topic that he was supposed to be talking about, which was the company’s innovations.

 Omar says, “Maybe that’s why he had so many flubs. His mind was elsewhere.” A “flub” (flub) is a minor mistake, a minor error. Interestingly enough, the first movie I ever saw in a movie theater was a Disney fi lm called Son of Flubber (flubber). A “flubber” would be someone who makes a  lot of mistakes. It’s a word we don’t use that often anymore in English conversa tion.

I was 12 years old, by the way, when I saw my first  movie in a movie theater. My parents didn’t have money to take everyone to movie  theaters since there were 11 of us – 11 children in our family. Going to movi e would’ve been very expensive. I actually went with a couple of friends  of mine. But this is not important to our story, is it?

Omar says that Paul’s “mind was elsewhere.” When we  say your mind was “elsewhere,” we mean you were distracted and were t hinking about something else instead of what you should have been thinking about and focusing on. Faith says, “I think you’ll have plenty of material for a  blooper reel.” A “blooper” (blooper) is similar to a flub or a slip –  it’s a mistake. Usually we use this word when talking about mistakes that actors and actress es make when they are filming a movie or a television show.

A “blooper reel” is a short, funny video that shows  the mistakes that someone made when he or she was speaking. Sometimes at the end of movies you’ll see a blooper reel, or on the DVD – back when people bo ught DVDs, which I guess soon will no longer be common – there were often bl ooper reels on the DVD from the movie, from the filming of the movie.

Omar says, “That’s true. In fact, if this were a fi lm, I’d have more outtakes than usable footage.” An “outtake” (outtake) is a part of a video that was filmed, but wasn’t included in the final film or the final vide o – the final television show, perhaps. “Footage” (footage) just refers to the rec orded video for a movie or television show. I say “video” since most things th at we film nowadays are done digitally.

Of course, in the old days there used to be physica l film that was in a camera, and the word “foot” was used to describe the length  of the film, so “footage” would describe a part of the physical film – a part  of the filming, if you will.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

There aren’t any slips or flubs in the script writt en by our scriptwriter, the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.
