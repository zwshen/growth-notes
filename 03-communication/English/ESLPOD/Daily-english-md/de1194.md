This dialogue is about using a software program – a n application on a computer or a phone – related to a map. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Caroline: I just got an email from Sandra with her new address. I wish I knew what kind of neighborhood our daughter is living in .

Bryce: Let’s find out. I’ll type in her address on this map program.

Caroline: That will just tell us where she’s living  within the city, not what kind of neighborhood it is.

Bryce: Just wait. I can show you the street view of  her apartment and you can see what her building looks like.

Caroline: Wow, that’s amazing, but doesn’t the buil ding look a little run-down?

Bryce: That’s what you get with high-resolution ima ges. You see every detail. You can navigate around and see a panoramic view of  her street.

Caroline: Oh, that doesn’t look very clean or safe.

Bryce: Let me show you an aerial view. The satellit e view will give you a better idea of the entire area.

Caroline: Is that an airport nearby and are those f actories? What will this other view show us?

Bryce: That provides real-time traffic information and allows for route planning. It looks like she lives on a highly congested street. Hey, where are you going?

Caroline: I’m going to visit our daughter. I want t o see for myself what kind of hovel she’s living in!

[end of dialogue]

Caroline begins our dialogue by saying, “I just got  an email from Sandra with her new address.” Your “address” (address) is informati on that allows someone to find you. Usually an “address” will have the name of the stre et on which you live, the number of your house or apartment building, the cit y where you live – here in the United States, the state in which you live – and so mething called a “zip (zip) code (code).” In some countries, it’s called a “postal c ode.” It’s a number that is assigned to the general area or neighborhood in whi ch you live. In some countries, the postal code is a combination of lett ers and numbers. In the United States, it’s just numbers. There are five digits in  a standard zip code.

So, Caroline has the address of Sandra, and we lear n that Sandra is her daughter – or I guess Carolyn and Bryce’s daughter – because she says, “I wish I knew what kind of neighborhood our daughter is li ving in.” Bryce says, “Let’s find out. I’ll type in her address on this map prog ram.” “To type (type) in” means to use what we call a “keyboard” (keyboard) to ente r information into a computer. A keyboard has the letters and numbers that you wou ld use to enter information into your computer. I say “letters,” of course, ref erring here to the English alphabet.

A “map program” would be any sort of application or  software program that would have a map associated with it and allow you to find  people on the map. On my phone, for example, I have a couple of different ma p “apps” or applications, including Google and Apple. Caroline says, “That wi ll just tell us where she’s living within the city, not what kind of neighborho od it is.” A “neighborhood” is in area of a city. Everyone lives in a neighborhood – an area or section of the city. Caroline is interested in finding out the kind of n eighborhood her daughter is living in – not just where it is, but is it a good neighborhood, is it a bad neighborhood, what kind of people live there, and s o forth.

Bryce says, “Just wait. I can show you the street v iew of her apartment and you can see what her building looks like.” On some map programs, including Google Maps, in many cities you can actually look at photo graphs of the different parts of the city – the buildings and houses in the city. Th at’s what “street view” allows

you to do. It’s an image of, or a photograph of, the street and the buildings on that street. It’s almost as if you were walking dow n the street. This is an amazing thing you can do. Some people don’t like the idea o f, say, Google going around and taking photographs of everyone’s house, but it can be convenient if you want to see what a house or building looks like.

Bryce says that is what he can do so that he and hi s wife, Caroline, can look at their daughter Sandra’s apartment. Caroline says, “ Wow, that’s amazing, but doesn’t the building look a little run-down?” The t erm “run-down” means that it is not in very good condition, perhaps because it is o ld or has been used a lot. If we describe a building as being “run-down,” we’re sayi ng the building is old and perhaps even falling apart. Maybe some of the walls  aren’t painted and the ceilings – the top of the room – perhaps has holes in it. That would be a run- down building, or what we would describe as a “run- down building.”

You could describe yourself as being “run-down” if you’ve been working a lot recently, or perhaps have some sort of cold or flu.  You may “feel run-down,” like you are falling apart. The phrasal verb “to fall ap art,” usually refers to an object whose pieces are beginning to come apart. In other words, the object is breaking apart into smaller pieces. Caroline thinks the buil ding her daughter Sandra lives in looks a little run-down. Her husband, Bryce, say s, “That’s what you get with high-resolution images.” “High-resolution images” a re images that are very high quality. They allow you to see the small details of  an image.

In fact, that’s what Bryce says next. He says, “You  can see every detail” (detail). “Details” are small specific pieces of information about something. A detail on a photograph could be a small part of the image. “Det ails,” in general, refer to specific pieces of information. You could have deta ils about almost anything. I could give you the details of a story, the specific  things that happened in a story, or you could give someone the details of the meetin g you went to – all the things that happened in the meeting, the specific pieces o f information.

Bryce says, “You can navigate around and see a pano ramic view of her street.” “To navigate” (navigate) means to move around or mo ve through something, especially if it is difficult. Here it refers to the ability to see different parts of the city or the, in this case, “street view.” You can –  on for example the Google map program, when it is available – actually move down the street and see the different houses along the street. In this case, the map program allows Bryce to see a “panoramic (panoramic) view” of her street. “ Panoramic” refers to a large, wide view of something.

Caroline says, “Oh, that doesn’t look very clean or  safe.” She’s referring to the area where her daughter lives – perhaps the streets  are dirty or the other buildings around her apartment are run-down as well . Bryce says, “Let me show you an aerial view.” “Aerial” (aerial) means from t he air. Again, many map programs will show you a satellite photo of an area , as if you were up in the sky looking down at it. Bryce mentions this in his next  sentence. He says, “The satellite (satellite) view will give you a better i dea of an entire area.” A “satellite” is a piece of equipment that goes around the earth, wa y up in space. It “orbits,” or goes around the earth, and some satellites can take  photographs of the earth.

Caroline says, “Is that an airport nearby and are t hose factories?” Caroline is now looking at the satellite or aerial photographs of t he neighborhood in which her daughter lives. She’s asking if there is an airport  nearby. She sees an airport on the photograph and she also sees some “factories” ( factories). A “factory” is a large building where things are “manufactured” – wh ere they’re made, where they’re produced. Normally you don’t find factories  next to nice or good neighborhoods because factories can be noisy or the y can have a lot of pollution associated with them. So, Caroline is concerned abo ut the quality of this neighborhood if it’s right near an airport and has factories in it.

Then she says, “What will this other view show us?”  She’s looking at the map program, probably pointing to some other feature on  the program. Bryce says, “That provides real-time traffic information and al lows for route planning.” On some map applications, you can find out what the tr affic is like – how many cars are on the street or freeway. “Real-time” means rig ht now – or more typically, within the last, say, five minutes. “Route” (route)  refers to how you go from one place to another. “Route planning” would allow you to figure out which streets or freeways you should take to get from one part of the city to another.

Bryce says, “It looks like she lives on a highly co ngested street.” If a street is “congested” (congested), there are a lot of cars on  it, a lot of traffic. It’s a very, what we would describe as, “busy” (busy) street. A “busy street” is a street that has a lot of cars going back and forth on it. Again , that is probably not the best place to live since it could be very noisy.

Bryce then asks Caroline, “Hey, where are you going ?” Caroline says, “I’m going to visit our daughter. I want to see for myself wha t kind of hovel she’s living in.” Caroline is going to, I guess, drive over to her da ughter’s house to see it for herself. She is worried that her daughter is living  in a “hovel” (hovel). A “hovel” is a small, old, dirty building. Usually it’s a very n egative way to describe someone’s house. Sandra, the daughter, lives in an apartment,  but we use the term “hovel” in general to describe a small, not very nice place  to live.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Caroline: I just got an email from Sandra with her new address. I wish I knew what kind of neighborhood our daughter is living in .

Bryce: Let’s find out. I’ll type in her address on this map program.

Caroline: That will just tell us where she’s living  within the city, not what kind of neighborhood it is.

Bryce: Just wait. I can show you the street view of  her apartment and you can see what her building looks like.

Caroline: Wow, that’s amazing, but doesn’t the buil ding look a little run-down?

Bryce: That’s what you get with high-resolution ima ges. You see every detail. You can navigate around and see a panoramic view of  her street.
