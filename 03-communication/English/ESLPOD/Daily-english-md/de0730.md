This episode is a dialogue between Joel and Susanne .  They’re talking about a school test, an exam that they took, and waiting for the results of that exam to see if they passed it or not.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Joel:  Did it come?

Susanne:  No, it’s not in today’s mail.  Why do I b other, anyway?  I know it’s a foregone conclusion.  I’ve failed.

Joel:  That’s bull!  I know you passed.  You’re jus t on tenterhooks waiting around for the results to arrive and you’re psyching yourself out.

Susanne:  No, I’m not.

Joel:  Don’t you remember that when you came home a fter taking the exam, you thought you had aced it?

Susanne:  I did, but that was before I started thin king about all of the questions I got wrong.  Then, I thought it was a toss up whethe r I passed or not.  Now that I’ve had even more time to think about it, I’m sure  I biffed it.

Joel:  See what I mean?  You’ve been psyching yourself out for weeks.  You studied really hard and I have no doubt that you pa ssed with flying colors.  All right, you’re not going to hear today, so let’s get  your mind off of the exam, okay?

Susanne:  All right.  How?

Joel:  You can help me  study for the exam.  I’m taking it at the next administration.  I have no intention of bombing it or even squeaking by by the skin of my teeth – like some people.

Susanne:  Very funny.  Okay, so maybe I’m psyching myself out – a little bit. Okay, I’m game.  Where do we begin?

Joel:  With all of the ones you thought you got wro ng.

Susanne:  What?!

Joel:  There’s no sense wasting all that worrying.  And if you did fail it, you’ll need to get ready to take it again.

Susanne:  Gee, thanks!

Joel begins by saying, “Did it come?” meaning did s omething arrive.  We’re not sure what it is, but we find out a little bit later .  Susanne says, “No, it’s not in today’s mail (the mail that arrived today).  Why do  I bother, anyway (meaning why do I worry about it)?  It’s a foregone conclusi on.  I’ve failed.”  A “foregone conclusion” is a result that is certain to happen o r an expected result.  “The team from Albert Lee High School has won the championshi p every year for 10 years, so this year’s result is a foregone conclusion,” me aning it’s obvious Albert Lee High School will win again.  Well, the foregone con clusion that Susanne believes is true is that she has failed.  “To fail” means to  be unsuccessful in an examination, a test, or an interview, when you don’ t pass.  “To fail” is the opposite of “passing.”

Joel says, “That’s bull!” (bull).  “Bull” is a poli te, shorter way of saying a vulgar expression.  The full expression is “bull (shit),” but that’s not a very nice thing to say, so sometimes in more polite conversation we ju st say “bull.”  If somebody says something to you and you think it’s wrong or they’re lying or it’s nonsense, you’ll say, “Oh, that’s bull.”  It’s kind of strong  however.  You would never that in a formal conversation – never say it to your boss i f you still want your job!  Joel says, “I know you passed (you were successful).  Yo u’re just on tenterhooks waiting around for the results to arrive and you’re  psyching yourself out.”  “To be on tenterhooks” (tenterhooks – one word) means to b e in suspense about what will happen in the future; to feel nervous or conce rned about something that will happen.

Joel says that Susanne is on tenterhooks because sh e is waiting around; she is waiting for the results of her exam to arrive and s he’s psyching herself out.  “To psych (psych) yourself out” is a two-word phrasal v erb meaning to prepare yourself mentally for something that is going to ha ppen, usually something that is difficult or unpleasant.  “To psych yourself out” u sually means that you are thinking about it, and because of the way you are t hinking about it you will fail; you will not do well.  You can psych someone else o ut; you can say things to them that will make them think about a situation or  a problem or a game that will cause them to lose because of what you said.  This is different than “to be psyched.”  “To be psyched” means to be prepared, to  be thinking about something but looking forward to it, happy about it .  There’s a third expression, “to be psyched up,” which is similar to the express ion “to be psyched.”  “To be psyched up” means to be ready for something.  But, “to be psyched out” usually means that you are thinking negatively, and because  of that will not succeed.

Susanne says, “No, I’m not,” I’m not psyching mysel f out.  Joel says, “Don’t you remember that when you came home after the exam, yo u thought you had aced it?”  “To ace (ace) (something)” usually means to p ass an exam or a test by getting an excellent score, perhaps even a perfect score.  I very rarely aced exams when I was in school!  Susanne says, “I did ( I did think that I aced the exam), but that was before I started thinking about  all of the questions I got wrong.  Then, I thought it was a toss up whether I passed or not.”  A “toss up” is a situation in which all of the possibilities are e qually likely to happen.  A “toss up” is when you can’t decide, when there are different possibilities, and they all look good.  “Toss” has a couple of different meanings in  English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Susanne says that she then thought it was a toss up  whether she passed or not; she couldn’t decide.  “Now that I’ve had even more time to think about it, I’m sure I biffed it.”  “To biff” (biff) means to do very po orly, to do a poor job at something. “I biffed the exam” means I failed it; I didn’t do very well.  “To biff” can also mean to fall or to fail at some sort of sporting event o r sporting activity.  “The hockey player skated down the ice and biffed,” he fell.  T hat’s another use of that word. Both ideas are similar; they relate to failure, whe n you biff.  “He approached a beautiful woman at the bar, but he biffed when he s tarted talking to her.”  That could mean that he fell down or it could mean that he failed.  And if he fell down, well, he definitely failed!  Not a good way to impr ess a beautiful woman to fall down in front of her.

Well, back to our story.  Susanne says that she’s s ure she biffed her exam.  Joel says, “See what I mean?  You’ve been psyching yourself out for weeks.  You studied really hard and I have no doubt (meaning I’ m absolutely sure) that you

passed with flying colors.”  “To pass with flying c olors” means to receive a high score on the test, to do very well.  “All right,” J oel says, “you’re not going to hear today, so let’s get your mind off of the exam, okay ?”  “To get your mind off of (something)” means to stop thinking about something  that you are worried about or that you are, we would say, “obsessing over,” th inking about constantly, over and over and over again, like when you biffed talki ng to the beautiful girl at the bar!

So, Susanne says, “All right.  How?”  How are we go ing to get my mind off of the exam?  Joel says, “You can help me  study for the exam.  I’m taking it at the next administration.”  An “administration” of an exam is  an opportunity to take the examination – to take the test.  If you want to go to college in the United States, you often have to take the Scholastic Aptitude – I guess they call it Scholastic Achievement Test, the SAT.  Or if you study at a co llege and you’re from another country, you may have to take the TOEFL exam, Test of English as a Foreign Language.  There are many different administrations  of these exams; they give them in different places at different times.

Joel says, “I have no intention of bombing it or ev en squeaking by by the skin of my teeth – like some people.”  “To bomb (bomb) (som ething)” means to get a very low score on something, usually an exam or a t est, to clearly fail.  It could be, however, you clearly fail something else, like that girl at the bar: “I bombed when I tried talking to her.”  Your friend says, “H ow did it go?”  “Oh, I bombed,” I did terribly.  “Bomb” has a number of meanings in E nglish, however.  Some of them – not all of them – some of them are in the Le arning Guide.

Joel says that he is not going to squeak by.  “To s queak by” means to pass an exam or pass some sort of challenge but just barely , by a very small amount.  To do something “by the skin of your teeth” means some thing similar to do it but just barely, to be successful by a very small amount.  J oel combines these two similar ideas by saying “to squeak by by the skin of his te eth.”

So, Susanne says, “Very funny,” because Joel is say ing that that’s what Susanne did.  She says, “Okay, so maybe I’m psyching myself  out – a little bit.  Okay, I’m game.  Where do we begin?”  “To be game” means to b e willing to try something or do something, especially something that may be a  little risky or that you have never done before.  “I’m game” means I’m willing to  do it.  Susanne says, “Where do we begin?”  And Joel says, “With all of the ones  you thought you got wrong,” meaning he wants to go over all of the questions th at Susanne thinks she got wrong on the exam.  Of course, this is not a very g ood way to get Susanne’s mind off of the exam, which is what Joel is suppose d to be doing.

Susanne can’t believe what Joel is saying; she says , “What?!  Joel says, “There’s no sense wasting all that worrying.”  The expressio n “there’s no sense” means there is no reason to, or it is useless to.  “There ’s no sense talking to her, she is already married.”  Well, Joel says, “There’s no sen se wasting all that worrying,” meaning since Susanne has been worrying about the e xam, she should try to do something constructive with it – something useful w ith it.  Joel says, “And if you did fail it (if you did fail the exam), you’ll need  to get ready to take it again.” Susanne then says, “Gee, thanks!”  But she says it a way that means the opposite.  “Gee, thanks” is what we say when someon e tells us something that they think may be useful but we know is not.  For e xample: “Well, you don’t have a date tonight.  But at least you can watch basebal l on television.”  You might say, “Gee, thanks!” meaning it’s not really the sam e; it’s not as good as having a date tonight.  Although for me, I would probably pr efer to watch baseball!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
