[start of dialogue]

Vern:  I really think we’ve bitten off more than we can  chew.  I like do-it-yourself projects, but installing a new window and a new door i sn’t as easy as it looks.

Genevive:  What we don’t know, we’ll learn as we go.  Okay, we’ve removed the old window.  This new double-paned one is going to be  great and it’ll slide open and close easily, unlike the old one.  We just need to pu t in a new frame first, and then we can move it into place.

Vern:  You make it sound so easy.  Is the screen going to  fit?  It looks too big.

Genevive:  Oh sure, it’ll fit.

Vern:  This latch doesn’t seem to be working.

Genevive:  It’ll work once it’s installed.  Come on, give  me a hand.  Hmm…the new window doesn’t seem to fit exactly.  I’m not sure w hat the problem is.  Let me think about it.  Let’s move on to the door and come back to it later.

Vern:  Are you sure?

Genevive:  Sure, I’m sure.  Installing the new door wil l be easier and we can get it out of the way.

 Vern:  Maybe we should wait until the window is install ed.  If we can’t finish installing the window and the door before nightfall,  it’ll be a very cold night in the house.

Genevive:  Don’t worry.  Let’s see, first we have to remove  the old door without damaging the jamb.  The hinges are rusted; it seems to be stuck.  Oh, I think it’s finally coming off.

Vern:  See?  Replacing the door isn’t going to be as e asy as you thought, is it?

Genevive:  I got it off in the end, didn’t I?

Vern:  Yes, but will you be able to put in the new on e before I die of frostbite?

[end of dialogue]

Vern and Genevive are “installing,” or putting in new windows and doors in their house.  Vern begins by saying, “I really think we’ve bitten  off more than we can chew.”  This is an old expression.  “To bite off (bitten is the past tense of bite – actually, it’s the past participle but we won’t go into that now) more than you can chew” – “to bite off more than you can chew.”  This expr ession means to try to do something that is too difficult for you to do, or for yo u to finish.  “To bite” means to typically use your teeth when you are eating food.  You ca n take a bite out of an apple for example; you put the apple in your mouth an d you take a piece.  “To chew” means to move your jaw up down so that the food go es in between your teeth and you’re able to swallow it.  But this expression  means that you, in a sense, have taken or bitten off too much and you can’t po ssibly chew it.  Again, it’s a general expression to mean you try to do something  that is too big or too difficult.

Vern says, “I like do-it-yourself projects, but installing a new window and a new door isn’t as easy as it looks.”  “Do-it-yourself,” sometim es abbreviated “DIY,” is when you do something typically around your house, such as ma king a desk or building a table.  In other words, you don’t pay some one else to do it or buy it; you do it yourself.  So, a “do-it-yourself project” would  be for example trying to install a new window.  “To install” means to put someth ing into something else or to put something onto something else so that it can be u sed.  When you buy a new water heater, to make your water hot, you have to install it.  You have to take it out of the box, put it where it belongs, conne ct the water, the electricity or the gas, and so forth.  That’s to install.  We use this verb a lot; we even use it in the computer world.  We talk about installing software , that’s putting the software onto your computer so you can use it.

 Vern doesn’t think that a new window or a new door is as easy as it looks, meaning you look at it and you think oh, that won’t be  very difficult but then when you try to do it, it is very difficult.  Genevive says, “What we don’t know, we’ll learn as we go.”  “To learn as you go” means to learn t hrough experience, learn through doing.  You don’t take a class, you don’t read a book, you just do it and you learn as you are doing whatever it is you are doing.   That’s to learn as you go.

Genevive, of course, thinks that they can install this new window and new door. She says, “Okay, we’ve removed (we’ve gotten rid of; we too k out) the old window.  This new double-paned one is going to be gre at and it’ll slide open and close easily, unlike the old one.”  So Vern and Genevive a re trying to install a double-paned window.  “Double-paned” (paned) is when  you have a window with two pieces of glass very close to each other, but there’s a small amount of air – sometimes there’s a special gas they use – between the two pieces of glass. What this does is it makes the window thicker, or more imp ortantly, it makes it so that you don’t hear what’s going on outside, or at lea st you hear less of what’s going on outside.  I, for example, need a double-pane d window in my house so that I don’t hear the children outside.  Or I can do what I usually do, which is go outside and tell the little kids to be quiet.  I’m tha t nice kind of neighbor, you know!

So, Genevive says that the double-paned window is going t o be great.  She says, “it’ll slide open and close easily.”  “To slide” (slide) m eans to move smoothly in one direction, typically when you are rubbing against some thing else.  I could take a glass of water and slide it across the table; I pu sh it so that moves smoothly across the table.  In this case, the windows are going to slide open and close easily, “unlike the old one,” meaning the old one did not do that.  Genevive says, “We just need to put in a new frame first, and the n we can move it into place.”  The “frame” (frame) is the square or rectangul ar shape usually made of wood or metal that goes around something; in this case,  it goes around the window.  You could also have a picture frame, which is the part that you see on the very outside – on all four sides – that holds the pict ure in place.

Vern says, “You make it sound so easy.  Is the screen going to fit?  It looks too big.”  A “screen” is something that you put behind a doo r or a window so that you can open the door or window and no bugs or flies will come in.  It’s usually made of metal or plastic with lots of small holes in it.  Ge nevive says, “Oh sure, it’ll fit,” meaning it will be able to be put here, the space wil l be right, it will not be too big. Vern says, “This latch doesn’t seem to be working.”  A “la tch” is a small piece of metal that you move to hold something closed or to let it be open.  So on a

 window, you typically have a little latch that when you mo ve it in a certain direction allows you to open the window; when you move it in a different direction, it will keep the window closed.  That’s a lat ch (latch).

Vern doesn’t think the latch is working, but Genevive says, “ It’ll work once it’s installed.  Come on, give me a hand.”  “To give (some one) a hand” means to help them do something, usually something physical like movi ng boxes or installing windows.  Genevive says, “Hmm (she’s uncertain abo ut something or she’s surprised by something)…the new window doesn’t seem to  fit exactly,” meaning it doesn’t go in the space perfectly; it must be  too big or too small.  “I’m not sure what the problem is,” she says, “Let me think abo ut it.  Let’s move on to the door (let’s start working on the door now) and come  back to the window later.”  Vern says, “Are you sure?”  Genevive says, “Sure, I’ m sure (meaning yes I am sure; I am certain).  Installing the new door wil l be easier and we can get it out of the way.”  “To get (something) out of the way”  means to do something that you don’t really like first; do it immediately so that you  can forget about it and go on to do something that you like better.  That’s to ge t something out of the way.

Vern says, “Maybe we should wait until the window is inst alled.  If we can’t finish installing the window and the door before nightfall,  it’ll be a very cold night in this house.”  “Nightfall” (one word) is the time when, or at the time when the sun sets; the time between afternoon and evening, when the sky be gins to go dark.  That’s nightfall.

Vern says that if they don’t get the window and door in stalled they’re going to be cold tonight.  Genevive says, “Don’t worry.  Let’s see, fir st we have to remove the old door without damaging the jamb” (jamb).  The “j amb” is one of the vertical pieces of wood on the sides of the window or the door; they could also be made of metal.  She says, “The hinges are rusted; it seems to b e stuck.”  A “hinge” is a small piece of metal that attaches the door to the door jamb; it allows the door to open and close.  It’s what connects the door typically to the “doorjamb,” or the permanent, unmovable part of the doorframe.  When som ething is “rusted” we mean that it has an orange or red dust on it that is so metimes created when metal gets wet.  The technical term would be “oxidized.”   So what happens is the hinges are rusted, and that makes it difficult to open t he door, that’s why Genevive says the door seems to be stuck.  When something is “st uck” (stuck) you cannot move it or open it; it is something that you can’t change because there’s some problem.

Genevive says, “Oh, I think it’s finally coming off.”  Vern says, “See?  Replacing the door isn’t going to be as easy as you thought?”  But Genevive doesn’t give up, she says, “I got it off in the end, didn’t I?”  “In  the end” means finally; after

 some work I did get the door off.  Vern says, “Yes, but w ill you be able to put in the new one (the new door) before I die of frostbite  (frostbite – one word)?” “Frostbite” is a condition where your fingers or your toe s, typically, are too cold and it starts damage your skin; it can even lead to damag e to your fingers and toes.  If you live in a northern climate – that is, a pl ace where it gets cold during the winter, you probably know about frostbite.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
