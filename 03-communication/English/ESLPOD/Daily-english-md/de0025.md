[start of dialogue]

(The phone rings.)

Lucy: Hello.

Jeff: Hey, Lucy, it's Jeff.

Lucy: Hey, welcome back. How was your vacation?

Jeff: Oh, it was great. The seven days in New York were a blast.

Lucy: Oh, yeah? Did you do any sightseeing or just visit with friends?

Jeff: I got to do both, actually. First, I saw my f riend Edmundo, who just moved there. He hadn't seen much of the city himself, so we went to all the tourist spots. We got a guidebook and went to the major museums, s aw a play, went to a concert in Central Park, and took the Staten Isla nd Ferry. We did all of that in a day and a half. It was a whirlwind, but we got to s ee a lot.

Lucy: A day and a half?! You guys must have been ex hausted.

Jeff: Yeah, we were. But, the rest of my trip was p retty low-key. My friends Pat and Billie rented a car and we took a road trip to Upstate New York to visit some other friends of ours.

Lucy: Did you have to stay over in a hotel along the way, or did you drive straight through?

Jeff: We didn't bother with booking hotel rooms, so  we just drove straight there. It wasn't that far.

Lucy: How long did you stay there?

Jeff: We were only there two days, and we drove bac k and got back last night. My flight was this morning at 8:00 a.m. The worst p art of the whole trip was that my flight was cancelled. I was rebooked onto anothe r flight that had a three- hour layover in Chicago. That was a major pain.

Lucy: It sounds like it. Well, I'm glad you made it  back okay. And you even have the weekend to rest up before work on Monday.

Jeff: Yeah, I'll need it. I've got to catch up on m y sleep!

We just listened to a telephone conversation betwee n Lucy and me about my trip to New York City. Lucy answered the phone by saying  “Hello,” which is the standard way to answer a phone in English: “Hello.”  And I said, “Hey Lucy, it's Jeff.” The expression “Hey” (hey) here means the sa me as “Hello.” A lot of people now, particularly young people, will say “He y” instead of saying “Hello,” although not when first answering the phone. You wo uldn't answer the phone by saying “Hey.” You would still say “Hello,” but the other person could then say, “Hey, Bob” or “Hey, Julie” instead of “Hello, Bob” or “Hello, Julie,” which might nowadays sound a little bit formal.

I said that my trip to New York City had been “a bl ast.” A “blast” (blast) here means a lot of fun. It is sort of an informal expre ssion that we use to describe a party or a trip or an event that was a lot of fun. After I tell Lucy that my trip was a blast, she says, “Oh yeah?” This expression, “Oh, y eah?” is very common in an informal conversation. It shows the other person th at you’re listening. “Oh, yeah?” means the same as “Really?” For example, som eone says to you, “The price of gasoline is now $4 a gallon.” You might re ply, “Oh, yeah?” meaning “Really?” It's very common to hear this phrase in c onversation.

I told Lucy that I visited my friend Edmundo and th at “we went to all the tourist spots.” A “tourist (tourist) spot (spot)” is a plac e where tourists like to go. The terms “spots” here just means places. I also said w e had a “guidebook.” A “guidebook” (guidebook) is a book that tells you wh ere the hotels and restaurants are and that lists, or has a list of, the tourist s pots that you will want to see. It's also called a “travel book” or a “travel guidebook. ”

 Edmundo and I “went to the major museums, saw a pla y, went to a concert in Central Park, and took the Staten Island Ferry.” “M useums” (museums) are places where you can see art and other cultural thi ngs. A “play” is a live performance in a theater. And a “concert,” of cours e, is live music that you go to hear in a public place. Edmundo and I “went to a co ncert in Central Park.” “Central Park” in New York City is a very large, ve ry famous park. It is located in the middle of Manhattan, which is one of the island s that is part of New York City.

I also said that we went on the Staten Island Ferry . There are five different sections of New York City, called “boroughs” (borou ghs). The main downtown borough is called “Manhattan,” which is also the na me of the island it is located on, but there's another island that is also part of  New York City called “Staten Island.” And there is a famous “ferry” (ferry) that  goes between Manhattan and Staten Island. A “ferry” is a boat that takes peopl e and often cars across a short distance of water. In Hong Kong, for example, there  is a ferry between the island and the mainland, or the main part of the country. And many other countries also have ferries that go out to nearby islands.

I said that my trip was “a whirlwind.” A “whirlwind ” (whirlwind) here means a period of time that goes by very quickly, in which you do many things within a very small amount of time. Lucy says, “You guys mus t have been exhausted.” The term “guys” can refer to just a man. But we als o use it informally sometimes to refer to both men and women. It can mean you two , or you all, or you people. Here it just means you and Edmundo. “To be exhauste d” means to be very tired. “I worked all day. I'm exhausted.”

I mentioned that “the rest of my trip was pretty lo w-key.” “Low-key” (low-key) means very relaxed, very calm. We sometimes use thi s term to describe someone who doesn't get excited easily: “He's very low-key.” I said my friends “rented a car and we took a road trip to Upstate Ne w York.” “To rent a car” means to pay money so that you can drive a car that  belongs to a car rental company. You can rent a car. You can rent a motorcy cle. You can – well, you can't really rent a horse easily in the city, but I  suppose it's possible in some places.

A “road trip” is a trip we take by driving somewher e. “I'm going to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco. It's about a five-hour ro ad trip.” Road trips usually are vacations. We don't talk about taking a road trip i f you are traveling somewhere for business, typically. Upstate New York is the pa rt of New York State that is north of New York City. So, when we say “Upstate Ne w York,” we mean a part of New York State that is not in New York City.

 Lucy asked, “Did you have to stay over in a hotel a long the way, or did you drive straight through?” “To stay over” is a two-word phr asal verb that means to stop and spend the night somewhere. You could stay over in a hotel or you could stay over at a friend’s house. It means to stay there ov ernight. “Along the way” means on the route or on the way to where you are going. “We are going to the beach, and along the way we are going to stop and buy some  soda and some food.” “To drive straight through” means not to stop. “I'm going to drive straight through from Los Angeles to Phoenix” means I'm not going to stop  and stay overnight anywhere. I'm going to drive the whole distance in one day.

I told Lucy that “we didn't bother with booking hot el rooms.” “To book (book) a room” means to reserve a room. You can book a hotel  room. You can also book an airline ticket. “I booked a ticket to New York” means I reserved or I bought an airplane ticket. I said that we were only in upstat e New York for two days and that we “drove back and got back last night.” “To drive back” means to return by car from someplace, and “to get back” means simply to a rrive, to come back to where you started from. “So, what time did you get back last night?” means “What time did you return last night?”

I had some problems with my trip to Los Angeles. Fi rst, “my flight was cancelled.” “To be cancelled” (cancelled) means to not occur, t o not happen – to be “called off,” we might also say. So, if your flight is “can celled,” it means that the airline has decided that your airplane, your flight, is not  going anywhere. Since my flight was cancelled, “I was rebooked onto another flight that had a three-hour layover in Chicago.” “To be rebooked” means to be issued a ticket for a different flight – to be booked again.

I said I had “a three-hour layover in Chicago.” A “ layover” (layover) is when you are traveling by airplane and you have to stop at a nother airport and wait before you continue flying to where you are going. For exa mple, if I am going to fly to London from Los Angeles, I might have a layover in New York City, which is in between Los Angeles and London when you fly there. The flight – my airplane – will stop in New York City, and I may have to get o n a different airplane to continue on to London. The opposite of a layover is  a “direct flight.” “I have a direct flight to Tokyo” means there will be no stop s between here and Tokyo. There will be no layovers, except maybe in Hawaii i f I'm lucky.

I described my return trip as “a major pain.” To say something was “a major pain,” or simply “a pain,” means it caused a lot of  problems. It caused a lot of trouble. Lucy responded by saying, “It sounds like it.” The expression “It sounds like it” means it sounds that way, or it appears th at way, or simply, “I understand.”

It's an expression we use in conversation. It is si milar to “Oh, yeah?” in that it shows you are listening to the other person. Someon e might say, for example, “I had to work late last night. I got home and I was v ery tired. I was exhausted.” And you might say, “Oh, yeah? It sounds like it.”

Lucy said, “I'm glad you made it back okay.” “To ma ke it back” means to come back or to arrive back safely, to return safely. “W hat time did you make it back last night?” means the same as “What time did you r eturn last night?” or “What time did you get back last night?” Notice that the word “back” can be used with a lot of different verbs to mean return.

Finally, Lucy said that I had the weekend “to rest up for work on Monday.” And I said that I needed “to catch up on my sleep.” “To r est up” is a phrasal verb that means to get some sleep, to relax, to rest. The ver b “to rest up” means the same, really, as to rest, but as with many verbs in Engli sh, we sometimes add a preposition like “up” or “over” or “back” to add em phasis to the word. “To catch up on my sleep” means to get back some of the sleep th at I am missing. “I need to catch up on my sleep” means I haven't slept enough in the last few nights, and so now I need to sleep a lot so that I will feel reste d.

Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
