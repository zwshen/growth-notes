<h2>Problem D: Finding the Transmitter</h2>

<p>Triangulation is an ancient technique for locating points in a
coordinate system based on the measurement of angles, as opposed to the
measurement
of distances. This makes it especially useful for precisely locating
points that are not practically reachable, as long as one can determine
what direction they are in.
</p><p>In this problem, you are trying to locate a radio transmitter somewhere on Earth, using angle measurements 
from two known points. At each of
the given points, the angle to the transmitter is determined by the angle between a shortest path to the North Pole 
and a shortest path
to the transmitter, measured clockwise looking from above the surface of the earth.
Paths are constrained to the surface of the earth, and the earth's surface is assumed to be a perfect sphere.

</p><p>It is guaranteed that neither of the given points is at the
North Pole or the South Pole (to avoid ambiguity in angle
measurements), and
one may assume that the transmitter is located at a third (distinct)
point which is uniquely locatable using the measurements.
</p><p>Points on the Earth are denoted using latitude and longitude
notation in decimal degrees (rounded to two decimal places).
See the figures for an explanation of the latitude/longitude system.
Note that for this problem, the equator's latitude must be reported as
"0.00 N",
while the longitude is written "0.00 W" at the Prime Meridian and
"180.00 W" at the International Date Line. Furthermore, the longitude
at the Poles
should be given as "0.00 W". In other words, where ambiguity exists,
the use of "0.00" and/or "N/W" is dictated.
</p><p>Input begins with the number of test cases on its own line.
Each test case consists of two
lines, each containing the latitude and longitude of a point followed
by the angle to the transmitter (all of these are given as real
numbers).
</p><p>For each test case, output a line containing the latitude and
longitude of the transmitter, rounded to two decimal places in decimal
degrees.
