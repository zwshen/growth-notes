This episode is a dialogue between Zuly and Eric about f lowers and trees.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Zuly:  Hurry up!  Mom will be home any minute and we’r e not done planting.

Eric:  Whose idea was it anyway to plant a garden for M om for her birthday? We’ve been working under this hot sun all day and the s mell of the fertilizer is really getting to me.

Zuly:  It was our idea, remember?  We both wanted to give Mom something special this year.  Look, we’re almost done.  We’ve alrea dy picked the weeds, prepared the soil, and dug the holes for the new seeds and flowers.  I’m taking the flowers out of their pots now and I’ll have them in the ground in a minute. After that, all we have left to do is to plant the ne w tree.  Keep digging!

Eric:  Are you sure the hole needs to be this deep?

Zuly:  Yes, the book says that the roots need to have room  to grow.  That’s the perfect place for it, too.  It’ll get a lot of direct sunlight.

Eric:  Great, but my arms are so tired, they’re about to fall off.

Zuly:  Move over.  I’ll dig for a while.  Why don’t you  water the new flowers?

Eric:  Sure, right after I take a little break.  In the meantime, I’ll supervise.  Come on.  Keep digging.  You’re almost there…

 Zuly:  I think you’d better keep your mouth shut, or I’ ll think of some new uses for that fertilizer!

Zuly and Eric are brother and sister.  Zuly says to Eric, “ Hurry up (go faster)! Mom will be home any minute (meaning very soon) and we ’re not done planting.” “To plant,” as a verb, means to put seeds or plants into  the ground so that they can grow, either to produce a flower or some kind of fo od typically.  A “seed” is a very small part of a tree or plant that when you put it in the ground grows another tree or plant.  It’s how – one way how trees and plant s reproduce, how you get more of them.  The verb, then, is “to plant” seeds, fl owers, or trees – to put them in the ground.

Eric says, “Whose idea was it anyway to plant a garden for Mom for her birthday?”  A “garden” is an area often near your hou se where you grow plants, either flowers or food.  Many people grow certain kinds of food in gardens.  When I was young we had a small garden where we had tomatoe s and carrots and, I think, green onions.  I was never a very good gardener.  A “gardener” is someone who works in a garden.  A “gardener,” more comm only pronounced “gardner ,” is also someone who you bring to your house to cut you r grass and trees and so forth.

So, Zuly and Eric are planting a garden – that’s what we would say, “to plant a garden” – for their mother.  He says, “We’ve been workin g under this hot sun all day and the smell of the fertilizer is really getting to  me.”  “Fertilizer” (fertilizer) is often made from the waste of animals – if you understan d what I mean.  When the animal goes to the bathroom, you take what comes out  of the animal, and you put it in your garden, because it will help the gr ound – the soil we would call it; the dirt – it will help it give nutrients – give f ood to the plants that will then help the plant grow.  At least that’s what I think happen s – I’m not a gardener!  “To get to (someone)” means to bother someone, especially after a long period of time. “My new colleague (my new co-worker) is really getting to me.”  He’s bothering me.

Well, Eric says that the smell of the fertilizer is getti ng to him.  Fertilizer doesn’t smell very nice!  Zuly responds, “It was our idea (both of us), remember?  We both wanted to give Mom something special this year.  Lo ok, we’re almost done (we’re almost finished; we have almost completed the g arden).  We’ve already picked the weeds, prepared the soil, and dug the holes f or the new seeds and flowers.”  Couple of words there: “We picked the weeds.”   A “weed” (weed) is a plant that you don’t want, that you didn’t put in you r garden but is growing there

 anyway.  That’s a weed.  “Weed” informally – slang – also  can mean marijuana, the drug that some people smoke.  In fact, there is a television show – I think it’s still running – it’s still being shown, called Weeds , about a family that grows marijuana.  Strange but true!  Well here, Zuly and E ric are trying to get rid of the weeds, that’s why Zuly says they have “picked them,” meaning  they have taken them out of the ground.  They’ve also prepared the soi l.  “Soil,” as I mentioned earlier, is another name for dirt or earth; it’s what  you put the seeds into when you are planting them.  “To dig” (dig) means to make a hole in the earth to usually put something in there.  The past tense of “di g” is “dug” (dug).  “Dig” has other meanings, which you can find in our Learning Gui de.  “Seeds,” we’ve already mentioned also, are a small part of the plant  that has all of the necessary genetic information to reproduce, or to make a new pla nt or a new tree.  A “hole,” you probably know, is an area with nothing in it surroun ded by something else. You can have a hole in the wall; you have the wall, but  then you have a circle, let’s say, that has nothing in it – there’s no wall.  Th at’s a hole.

So Zuly says that we’ve already picked the weeds, prepared the soil, and dug the holes for the new seeds and flowers.  “I’m taking the flowers out of their pots now and I’ll have them in the ground in a minute.”  A “p ot” (pot) is usually a round, small container, like a small bucket, that you put soil i nto – dirt into, and you can grow a plant in this little pot, and you can move the  pot from one part of the house to another.  In this case, Zuly is planting flowers that are in small pots. She will take them out of the pots and put them in the ground in the garden so they can grow bigger.  After putting the flowers in the ground, she says that all we have left to do is to plant the new tree.  The wor d “left” here is not the opposite of “right”; “left” here means remaining or st ill available.  For example, if you have five cookies and you eat two of the cookies, I can ask you, “How many cookies do you have left?”  How many are remaining?  And the answer, of course, is one, because I ate two of them when you were not looking.  You have to be careful with me!

So, Zuly is saying they’re almost finished, and tells Eric to keep “digging,” keep taking dirt out of the ground, making holes, so they can plant the flowers.  Eric says, “Are you sure the hole needs to be this deep?”  “To  be deep” means to be below the surface, going far below something.  If you die and they bury your body, they will dig a deep grave.  A “grave” is a place where you put a dead body.  The grave has to be deep – it has to be a hole that goes down far into the earth.

Eric is asking Zuly if the hole has to be very deep – “this deep?”  Zuly says, “Yes, the book says that the roots need to have room to grow.”   The “roots” (roots) of a plant or tree are the parts of the plant or tree tha t are below the ground that you

 can’t see.  “To grow” is when a living thing becomes bigg er, older.  Zuly says they need these big holes – these deep holes so that the roots have room to grow, they have a place where they can grow.  Zuly says, “T hat’s the perfect place for it, too.  It’ll get lots of direct sunlight. ”  “Sunlight” is light from the sun, obviously.  “Direct sunlight” is when the sunlight goes rig ht on it, there’s nothing in between it, it’s not blocked by anything else.

Eric says, “Great, but my arms are so tired, they’re about to fall off.”  “To fall off” means they are about to come off of his body, to leave o r become disconnected from his body.  Of course, Eric is joking; it’s just a way of  expressing how tired he is.

Zuly says, “Move over.  I’ll dig for a while.  Why don’t you water the new flowers?”  “To water,” as a verb, means to put water u sually on a plant or a tree or grass to help it grow.  Eric says, “Sure, right after  I take a little break.”  I’m going to stop working right now, he says.  “In the meant ime (meaning while I am doing that), I’ll supervise.”  “To supervise” (supervise) me ans to manage, to watch how someone is doing something, to give them instru ctions.  It’s what a boss does.  In fact, a person who supervises is often called  a supervisor, ending in “or”.  Eric says, “Come on.  Keep digging.  You’re a lmost there.”  He’s saying this to Zuly.  Zuly says, “I think you’d better keep your mo uth shut (“to keep your mouth shut” means to stop talking) or I’ll think of some new uses for that fertilizer!”  She’s basically saying to Eric if you don’t be  quiet I may take this smelly, unpleasant fertilizer and, perhaps, throw it at  you.  That’s the way brother and sisters often act, of course.  I know that very well!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
