<P>
This in not ``<EM>another brick in the wall</EM>", it's just a matter of adding numbers. Suppose you have a wall with the shape of a triangle, like the one shown below. The wall has 9 rows and row <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> has exactly <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> bricks, considering that 
top row is the first one and bottom row is the ninth. Some bricks are labeled with a number and
other ones are blank. Notice that labeled bricks appear only on odd rows and
they occupy odd positions within the row. The problem you must solve is finding a suitable number for each blank
brick taking into account one simple rule: the number of a brick is obtained by
adding the numbers of the two bricks below it. Obviously, this rule does not apply to the ninth row.
Numbers are supposed to be integers.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>

<P>
The first line of the input contains an integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, indicating the number of test cases.
This line is followed by the lines corresponding to the test cases. 
 Each test case is  described in five lines. These five lines correspond
 to odd rows of the wall, from top to bottom, as described above. Line <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> contains the
numbers corresponding to odd bricks on row <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> of the wall (that is, non blank bricks), 
enumerated from left to right and
separated with a single space. It is supposed that each test case is correct,
that is, there exists a solution to the problem that the case describes.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each test case, the output should consist of nine lines describing the
numbers of all bricks of the wall. So, line <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> should contain the
numbers corresponding to the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> bricks on row <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> of the wall, enumerated from left to right and
separated by a single space.

<B>Note:</B> Here we have an example with two test cases. The first one corresponds to the wall depicted above.
