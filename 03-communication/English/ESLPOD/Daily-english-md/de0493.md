This episode is a dialogue between someone who works at a  “sandwich shop,” a restaurant that sells sandwiches, and a customer named Jared .  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Employee:  Welcome to Grubway.  What can I get for you?

Jared:  I’m still deciding.  I’m trying to lose weight a nd I hear that eating a sandwich for lunch every day will help me do that.  Do you  guys have a BLT or a club?

Employee:  We don’t have a BLT, but we do have a ham o r turkey club.

Jared:  Okay, I’ll take the club.

Employee:  Ham or turkey?

Jared:  Can I get half and half, or better yet, can I  get double ham and double turkey?

Employee:  Sure, no problem.

Jared:  I’d like cheese on that, too.

Employee:  Would you like your bread toasted and the ch eese melted?

Jared:  Uh, sure.

 Employee:  What else would you like on your sandwich, the  works?

Jared:  What comes with the works?

Employee:  It includes lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bell pe ppers, olives, and pickles, and any spreads, condiments, or seasonings you’d like.

Jared:  Oh, okay.  I’ll have the works, but hold the pickle s and olives.  I’d like mayonnaise on the side, too, please.  You know what?  I ’d like to add some chicken to that.

Employee:  That’ll be $1.20 additional.

Jared:  That’s fine.  I’d also like extra cheese, and wh y don’t you add some roast beef, too?

Employee:  Okay, I can do that.  Will that be all?

Jared:  Yeah, but while you’re at it, throw in two ba gs of chips and a couple of cookies.

Employee:  Okay, I can ring you up down here.

Jared:  Hey, tell me, how long before I start losing we ight?

Employee:  Well, that’s hard to say.  You may want to lo ok at the nutritional information chart to determine that.

Jared:  Nah, I can already feel the pounds coming off!

Our dialogue begins with the employee at the sandwich sh op saying to Jared, the customer, “Welcome to Grubway.”  There’s a famous sandwich shop here in the United States called Subway.  It’s a chain; that is, the re are many different restaurants like this where you can go and order a sandwi ch.  You can either eat it at the restaurant or do what most people do, which is have it “to go,” meaning you take it with you.

The employee asks Jared, “What can I get for you (what kin d of sandwich do you want)?”  Jared says, “I’m still deciding (I’m still thinkin g about it),” he says, “I’m

 trying to lose weight and I hear that eating a sandw ich for lunch every day will help me do that.”  A few years ago, this chain of sandwi ch shops, Subway, had a famous commercial where they had one of their customers, w hose name was Jared, come on and say that he lost weight because the on ly thing that he ate for a month or two months, or however long it was, was the  Subway sandwiches. So Jared is, in our dialogue, thinking about the same t hing.  He says, “Do you guys have a BLT or a club?”  “Guys,” here, is informal, me aning do you, people who work here.  He’s talking to a woman, so we use the t erm “guys” (plural) to refer often to both men and women, boys and girls tog ether.

A “BLT” is a sandwich with bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  BTL – bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich; obviously there’s bread with the sandwich.   A “club sandwich” is a sandwich that is made from three slices – three piece s of bread, and two or more different kinds of meat.  Usually there’s lettuce an d tomatoes and mayonnaise, perhaps other food in there; but it’s three  pieces of bread, and then two different types or more of meat inside the sandwich.   Usually it’s something like ham or turkey, perhaps chicken.

The employee says, “We don’t have a BLT, but we do have a ham or turkey club. Jared says, “Okay, I’ll take the club,” meaning that’s what I want to order.  The employee says, “Ham or turkey?”  Jared then says, “Can I get  half and half?” “Half and half” means 50 percent of one thing and 50  percent of another.  If you’re going to dinner with a vegetarian and you’re g oing to have, say, pizza, you might say, “Well, let’s get a pizza half and half, half vegetarian and half pepperoni.”  I’ll eat the pepperoni side!

Well, Jared wants the sandwich half and half, half tur key half ham, and then he says, “or better yet, can I get double ham and double tu rkey?”  “Double” means twice as much as normal.  “Double” has a couple of diffe rent meanings however. You can take a look at our Learning Guide for some addi tional explanations of those additional meanings.

The employee says, “Sure, no problem.”  Jared says, “I’d l ike cheese on that, too.”  The employee then asks, “Would you like your bre ad toasted and the cheese melted?”  “To toast bread” means to make it brown  and slightly hard; you put it next to a source of high heat, or you put it in a little machine called a “toaster.”  “Melted” means that something is solid that  becomes more like liquid. If you take a piece of cheese and put on a sandwich and then heat it, the cheese will melt.

Jared says, “Uh, sure.  The employee then says, “What else wo uld you like on your sandwich, the works?”  When you order a sandwich or a hamburger and

 somebody asks if you want “the works” – or a hot dog, thin king of fast foods – what they mean is that they will give you everything possibl e, everything that you could get on the hamburger, sandwich, or hot dog.  Wel l, Jared says, “What comes with the works?” meaning what does that include.  T he employee says, “It includes lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, olives, a nd pickles, and any spreads, condiments, or seasonings you’d like.”  A “spread” is a soft food or a thick liquid that you put on bread in a thin layer.  For example, you can use strawberry jelly or strawberry jam; that could be used as a spread.  You can make your own spread out of mayonnaise and perhaps some ot her food and put that on a sandwich.  A “condiment” is a powder or a liq uid that is added to food to give it more taste.  The word “seasonings” is a powder or  a dry herb, which is a small plant, that you add to something to give it more flavor.  So for example, basil and oregano are two common seasonings in food.

Jared says, “Oh, okay.  I’ll have the works,” meaning I wan t to order a sandwich with everything on it – the works.  “But,” he says, “hold  the pickles and olives.” When you are ordering food and you use the expression “ho ld,” such as “hold the pickles,” or “hold the lettuce,” you’re telling the emp loyee – the waiter or waitress that you don’t want have something that is normally part  of that dish – that is normally part of that meal.  So if you are having, say, a cheeseburger that normally comes with lettuce, you might say, “I want one ch eeseburger, hold the lettuce,” meaning don’t give me the lettuce.  There w as a famous television commercial when I was young, before the Internet was bo rn, that had a song that was part of the commercial, and for some reason I have t his weird memory of songs that are part of commercials or television programs, I’m not sure why. Anyway, the song for the commercial, what we would call the “jingle,” was:  [Jeff sings]

Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce, Special orders don’t upset us. All we ask is that you let us have it your way. Have it your way, Have it your way at Burger King.

Thank you!  “Have it your way” means you can have your sandwich  however you want.  It was an advertisement for a hamburger restaura nt called Burger King, which is still in existence, although they don’t use that co mmercial anymore and haven’t since the 1970s.

Jared, continuing on with our story, wants the works, but he wants the pickles and olives held – he wants them to hold the pickles and o lives.  He says, “I’d like mayonnaise on the side, too, please.”  Mayonnaise “on the side,” meaning

 separated from the rest of the food.  If a sandwich nor mally has mayonnaise or mustard on it, or any other kind of food, you can ask for  it “on the side,” especially if it’s a liquid, that’s the most common use of  that.

Then Jared says, “You know what?  I’d like to add some chi cken to that.”  The employee says, “That’ll be $1.20 additional,” meaning extra.  Jared says, “That’s fine.  I’d also like extra cheese, and why don’t you add some roast beef, too?” meaning please add some roast beef, an additional kind  of meat.  He says, “while you’re at it, throw in two bags of chips and a co uple of cookies.”  The expression “while you’re at it” is a phrase used to ask some one to continue something they are doing, but do something additional.   Since the employee is getting Jared’s food, he says, “well, while you’re at it (since you are doing it anyway), also throw in (meaning include; add) two bags of chips (potato chips) and a couple of cookies.”

Then Jared asks, “how long before I start losing weight? ”  Well, of course, Jared has added all this extra food to the sandwich, so he prob ably won’t be losing any weight.  The employee says, “that’s hard to say (that’s dif ficult to determine). You may want to look at the nutritional information ch art to determine that.”  The “nutritional information” is the information about h ow many calories, how much fat, how much sodium a food contains.

Jared says, “Nah (meaning ‘no’), I can already feel the pounds coming off!”  “To come off” means to, in this case, reduce or become less.  S o he’s saying he can already feel the pounds, his extra weight in his body, com ing off – disappearing. “To come” is used with lots of different prepositions as a phrasal verb; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanatio ns.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
