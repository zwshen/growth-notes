This episode is called “Working in a Bad Economy.”  It’s a dialogue that is going to use a lot of vocabulary in talking about, well, a bad  economy, when people are losing their jobs and companies are not make a lot of m oney.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Shivon:  This bad economy is really taking its toll.

Lex:  Tell me about it!  My company has already laid off 20% of its workforce, and now the management is talking about cutting salaries.  I t goes without saying that there won’t be any bonuses this year.

Shivon:  What are you complaining about?  At least you st ill have a job.  Try working as a freelancer.  I’ve had to cut my hourly rate t o compete with all of the people flooding the job market.

Lex:  At least you’re still able to pick and choose your clie nts.  I have to do what my bosses tell me, no matter what.  If they say I have to w ork overtime, that’s what I have to do.  I don’t even get compensated for it !  You can bill by the hour.

Shivon:  What’s the good of billing by the hour if I d on’t have any clients?  You don’t know how good you have it.  I don’t want to hea r another word until you walk a mile in my shoes!

Lex:  Ditto!

[end of dialogue]

 Shivon begins our dialogue by telling Lex, “This bad econ omy is really taking its toll.”  “Economy” refers, in general, to the financial system where things are bought and sold in any country or area.  “Economy” actuall y has a couple of different meanings in English however, so take a look a t that Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  “To take its toll on (some thing)” means to have a negative effect or a bad influence on something, to mak e something more difficult.  So, Shivon says this bad economy is taking its to ll, meaning it’s causing damage to people, to companies, and so forth.

Lex says, “Tell me about it!”  This expression doesn’t mean what it says; it doesn’t mean that the person is asking you to tell you some thing.  It’s an expression we use to mean yes, I know.  You’re agreeing w ith someone and saying that you also know the same thing.  Lex says, “My compan y has already laid off 20% of its workforce.”  To “lay off (someone)” means to take away someone’s job.  So, if John has been laid off, that mea ns he’s been fired – he lost his job.  Often we use this phrasal verb to talk abo ut someone who loses their job because of a bad economy, not because they did a  bad job. “Workforce” is just another word for the group of peop le who work in a particular industry, a particular kind of business, or even in a part icular country.  The American workforce refers to everyone who works in the Unit ed States.

Lex says that the management is talking about cutting salar ies.  “Salary” is the amount of money you receive for your work.  There’s anothe r word, also, called “wages” (wages), which can mean the same thing, althoug h usually when we say “wages,” we’re talking about someone who works by the hou r, who makes so many dollars each hour.  If you are paid regardless of ho w many hours you work (meaning it doesn’t matter if you work more hours, you still get the same pay) that’s called a salary.  Lex says, “It goes without saying th at there won’t be any bonuses this year.”  If you say “it goes without saying,” you ’re saying that what you are about to say is very obvious.  Another way to say this would be, simply, “obviously.”  Obviously – it goes without saying that there won’t be any bonuses this year.  A “bonus” is money that you receive from you r company (the place you work for), usually at the end of the year.  If the compa ny has done very well, sometimes they’ll give of all of their employees more mon ey.  Or, if you have done a particularly good job you might get this as an e xtra gift.

Shivon says, “What are you complaining about?  At least you  still have a job.  Try working as a freelancer.”  A “freelancer” is somebody who works for, perhaps, many different companies.  The technical term we might u se is “independent contractor,” someone who works for different companies but  is not an employee – a full-time employee of any of them.  Shivon says, “I h ad to cut my hourly rate

 to compete with all of the people flooding the job m arket.”  Your “hourly rate” is the amount of money that you get per one hour of work.   Freelancers or independent contractors sometimes are paid by the hour, t hat is, for each hour that they say they worked.  Sometimes, freelancers are pai d “by the job,” meaning here are the things you have to do, and we’l l pay you so much money for finishing them.  When Shivon says “people are flood ing the job market,” she means that they are more and more people suddenly doing the same kind of work that she is.  To “flood” something to suddenly add a  large number of that thing: “We were flooded with emails last week.”  That  means that suddenly we receive lots and lots of emails.  The “job market” is the  people who are looking for jobs.  It’s a general description of hiring and looking to hire, that process, that group of people – the companies and the people looking  for work is called the job market.  If the economy is bad, then the job market is bad; there aren’t a lot of jobs, or there aren’t many jobs that pay well.

Lex says, “At least you’re still able to pick and choose your clients.”  To “pick and choose” means to have many options, to be able to select on ly the ones you really want to do or want to work with, in this case.  Lex says, “I have to do what my bosses tell me, no matter what.  If they say I have to w ork overtime, that’s what I have to do.”  “Overtime” (one word) means worki ng more than your normal hours.  Americans typically work 40 hours per week.  But i f you work 50, 60, maybe even 70 hours, that would be called overtime.  Le x says, “I don’t even get compensated for it!”  To “compensate” means to pays somebo dy for their work. So, Lex is saying that he doesn’t get any extra money even t hough he works more hours than he used to.  “Compensate” has a couple of different meanings in English, however, so be sure to look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lex says, “You can bill by the hour,” meaning you, Shivon,  can bill by the hour. To “bill” means to tell somebody how much they need to  pay you, to send them a piece of paper that says you must pay me this amount of mo ney because I did this work for you.  “By the hour” just means each hour.  M any freelancers – independent contractors – will bill by the hour.  Depen ding on how many hours they work, that’s how much you have to pay them.

Shivon says, “What’s the good of billing by the hour if I  don’t have any clients (any customers)?”  She’s saying yes, I can bill by the hour,  but if you don’t have anyone to bill – you don’t have any jobs – then it doe sn’t matter.  Shivon says, “You don’t know how good you have it.”  If someone says, “You don’t know how good you have it,” they mean don’t understand or you don ’t realize what a good situation you have compared to me, or compared to someone  else.  Some

 people say that to someone who is complaining a lot, wh o’s saying, “Oh, my job is terrible.  My life is miserable.  My girlfriend doesn ’t love me,” someone else may say, “You don’t know how good you have it.  At least yo u have a job.  At least you have a girlfriend.”  Well, maybe not the gi rlfriend, but at least you have a job!

Shivon says, “I don’t want to hear another word until yo u walk a mile in my shoes!”  The expression “to walk a mile in (someone’s) sho es” means to experience the same thing that someone else is experiencin g, to live someone else’s life, to have their experiences.  So Shivon is sayin g that you don’t understand me, my experiences, so I don’t want to hear yo u complain until you have had the same experiences  – difficult experiences, in this case – as I have.

Lex says, “Ditto!”  “Ditto” (ditto) is an informal term we use to say that you agree with someone completely, what someone just said.  It’s al so if you want to repeat exactly what someone else has said.  So, let’s say a mother  is talking to her two daughters and she asks the first daughter, “Where were yo u tonight?” and the first daughter says, “I was with Julie.”  Then she asks the second daughter, “Where were you tonight?” and the second daughter says,  “Ditto” meaning I was with Julie, too.  Here, Lex is saying that he is in agree ment with Shivon in that he doesn’t want to hear her complaining until she has exper ienced what he has.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Lex:  Ditto!
