This episode is a dialogue between Jane and Arnold about doing physical exercises for your body. Let's get started.

[start of dialogue]

Jane:  I’ve just had the best workout at the gym!

Arnold:  You don’t need to go to a gym to exercise.  I exercise right here in my apartment.

Jane:  Oh, yeah? What can you do in this small spac e?

Arnold:  Nearly everything I need to do. Before I d o my calisthenics, I stretch. And every morning I do sit-ups, push-ups, and pull- ups.

Jane:  That’s not enough to keep you in shape.

Arnold:  I’m not finished. Every other day I do lun ges and squats, and I lift free weights.

Jane:  But what about a cardio workout?

Arnold:  I do jumping jacks, run in place, and jump  rope on the balcony.

Jane:  I guess you’ve got it all figured out.

Arnold:  I think so. Have you seen the light? Are y ou going to stop going to the gym?

Jane:  No way! Exercise isn’t the only reason I go to the gym, you know. I go for the view.

Arnold:  I have a feeling you’re not talking about the view outside.

Jane:  You’ve got that right!

Jane – no relation to Jane Fonda, who was a famous actress and activist, political activist, in the United States, she’s sti ll alive. She became famous also for doing these tapes, these video tapes, of how to  exercise, but this is a different Jane. Jane says, “I've just had the best workout at  the the gym.” A “workout,” one word, is a period of exercise, a period of time tha t you use your body in such a way as to physically challenge it so you can improv e your strength, your health and so forth. The “gym” (gym) is a place where you go to do exercises. Gym is short for the longer word, “gymnasium.” Don’t confu se the spelling of “gym” (gym) with the name “Jim,” which comes from James. That’s  spelled (Jim). And both of them are different from “gin” (gin) which is an alc oholic drink that I'll be having when I finish this episode.

Arnold says – and this is not Arnold Schwarzenegger , the former governor of California, completely different Arnold! – Arnold s ays, “You don’t need to go to a gym to exercise.” To “exercise” is the verb we use for using your body in a way that will help it physically, so when you do a work out or go and “work out” (as a verb), you are going to exercise. Arnold says, “I e xercise right here in my apartment.”

Jane says, “Oh, yeah? What can you do in this small  space?” Jane doesn’t quite believe that Arnold can exercise in his apartment. Arnold says, “Nearly everything I need to do.” “I can do everything I ne ed to do,” he says. He says, “Before I do my calisthenics (calisthenics)” – is, like gymnasium, originally from a Greek word – calisthenics are exercises that improv e your strength and your flexibility, but they don’t require any typically s pecial equipment. They're basically just moving your body and doing things with your bo dy that could be done anywhere. To “stretch” (stretch) means to move your  body in ways that push or pull parts of it so that it helps you with, they sa y, your flexibility. You're able to move your muscles more easily if you stretch. That’ s what I'm told.

Arnold says, “And every morning I do sit-ups, push- ups, and pull-ups.” A “sit-up” is an exercise where you lie down on the ground wit h your back against the ground, you put your head on the ground, you put yo ur hands either behind your

head or on the side of your head, and then you sit up from that position, either with your knees up (your legs up), or your body fla t. A “push-up” (push-up) is an exercise where you're lying on the ground, but you' re lying on your stomach, this time with your face forward. Then you put your two hands flat on the floor and you push up with your arms and you raise your body up. “Pull-ups” (pull-ups) are exercises that involve having a bar, usually a meta l bar (it could be a thick wooden one), and you grab onto it with your hands ( so you're below the bar, typically), and you grab onto it with your hands ,a nd you pull your whole body up using your arms to do so. So, we have sit-ups, push -ups and pull-ups.

Jane says, “That’s not enough to keep you in shape. ” To be “in shape” means to be physically in good condition. We might say physi cally “fit” (fit). Arnold then says, “I'm not finished. Every other day I do lunge s and squats, and I lift free weights. A “lunge” (lunge) is an exercise that is d one by standing with your two legs apart, one in front of the other, and then you  bend one knee or you walk forward bending your knees as you go far down. A “s quat” is an exercise where your two feet, you're on your feet, but your two fe et are parallel. Your legs are parallel. You don’t have one in front of the other.  You then bend your knees so that your butt, your bottom, is almost touching you r feet and then you stand up again. Often people put weight on their shoulders t o make the squat more difficult. It's very good for your leg muscles. Arn old says he also “lifts free weights.” To “lift something” is to take it in your  hand and lift it up in the air. “Lifting weights” means going and taking very heavy  objects and moving them up and down with your arms or legs. Free weights are w eights that are not attached to any machine. It used to be that all weight lifti ng was free weight lifting. Now, they have different machines that you can lift weig hts with.

Jane says, “But what about a cardio workout?” “Card io” (cardio) comes from cardiovascular. It refers to your heart. A cardio w orkout is one such as riding a bike, running, jogging, walking quickly, where you get your heart rate up. Your heart starts to beat much faster. That’s a cardio w orkout. Arnold says for his cardio, he does jumping jacks. “Jumping jacks” whic h used to be very popular during the middle of the 20 th  Century in the ‘50s and ‘60s and ‘70s – I don’t kn ow how popular they are now in schools – but a jumping  jack is where you stand with your feet together and then you jump up, and y ou put your two feet at a distance from each other. You separate them. You ta ke your two arms and you raise them above your head, often clapping your han ds above your head, and you do all this quickly. And that’s a jumping jack.  It's kind of funny, you can see kids do this. It's an exercise that used to be very  popular in grade schools for young children.

Well, Arnold is no child, but he does jumping jacks . He also runs in place and jumps rope on his balcony. To “run in place” means not to move. You go through the motion of running, but you're not going anywher e. You're standing in one place. To “jump rope” is to take a long piece of ro pe and hold each end in each hand, you then swing it or move it in a circle so t hat it goes under your feet and then over your head, and you continue to do that an d, of course, in order for it to go under your feet, you have to jump up, and that’s  why we call it “jumping” rope.

Jane says, “I guess you’ve got it all figured out.”  I guess you understand it all. Arnold says, “I think so.” Then he asks Jane, “Have  you seen the light? Are you going to stop going to the gym.” The expression “to  see the light” means to understand something. Usually, you come to this und erstanding quickly or suddenly. It's often about something very important  in your life. Sometimes people use this expression for people who have reli gious conversions, so it's a serious, deep change in your thoughts and your beli efs. But Arnold isn't really talking about anything that serious. He’s saying to  Jane that maybe now she will see that it's not necessary to go to the gym to do exercises.

But Jane says, “No way!” No, she doesn’t agree. “Ex ercise isn't the only reason I go to the gym, you know.” She says, “I go for the v iew” – what she can see there and, of course, she can see other people, perhaps o ther attractive people. She won't see me there because I don’t go to the gym an d I'm not very attractive. (Yeah, I know, I know.)

Arnold says, “I have a feeling you're not talking a bout the view outside.” That is, he’s saying I'm guessing you're not talking about t hings you can see outside of the gym or from inside of the gym to the outside. Y ou're talking about the people in the gym. Arnold is no fool. Jane says, “You’ve g ot that right.” That expression, “you’ve got that right” means simply yes, you are a bsolutely correct.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
