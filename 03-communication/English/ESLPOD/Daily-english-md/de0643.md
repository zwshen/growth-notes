This episode is called “Liberal and Conservative News.”  It  will use a lot of vocabulary that is used in American politics and media to describe two different philosophical views of the way the government should work .  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bill:  Why are you reading that rag?

Rachel:  I enjoy reading it.  I like its news coverage an d its incisive commentaries.

Bill:  That’s nothing but a liberal propaganda rag.  You can’t believe a thing they print in there.

Rachel:  That’s not true.  The news stories are objective and unbiased.  This magazine isn’t like the newspapers and news websites you rea d.  Those are run by ultraconservative reactionaries, who only know how to w rite diatribes.  If I only read the news sources you read, I would think that this w orld was being ruled by liberals.

Bill:  The world is being ruled by liberals, at least b y the liberal press.

Rachel:  You’ve got to be kidding!  Our politics and our  financial system are run by staunch conservatives, who ignore any point of view other  than their own. Those of us who are enlightened…

Bill:  You call yourselves enlightened?  All you and your dyed-in-the-wool liberals want to do is to tear down old traditions.

 Rachel:  Yes, we do want to tear down old traditions, old traditions that keep us from making progress toward…

Sophia:  Mom, Dad, what’s going on in here?  Why are you yelling?

Rachel:  Oh, it’s nothing, honey.  Go back to sleep.  Y our Dad and I are just having a friendly little talk.

I’m not going to try to explain to you the differences between liberals and conservatives politically here in the United States, that w ould require several English Cafés.  Generally speaking, if you know something a bout American politics, you can understand the difference by understandin g the difference between Democrats, who are typically liberal, and Repub licans who are typically conservative.

Well, this is a dialogue between Bill and Rachel.  Bil l says to Rachel, “Why are you reading that rag (rag)?”  A “rag,” in this sense, i s a poor quality newspaper, a newspaper that is not reliable, often because it is very p olitically biased.  That is, it only reports the news from one political view.  “Rag”  has a couple of different other meanings in English, and those are found in, of course, the Learning Guide.

Rachel says, “I enjoy reading it.  I like its news coverage a nd its incisive commentaries.”  “News coverage” are the stories that app ear in the newspaper or that are talked about in a magazine or on radio or  television.  “Coverage” is a general term to describe how much of something is includ ed, so this is how much news and what kind of news is included in the newspaper.  Rachel also likes the newspaper’s incisive commentaries.  A “commentary” is somethi ng that is written or spoken about an idea, sometimes while it is happenin g, sometimes after the fact.  Most newspapers, at least in the United States, ha ve commentary by different writers that represent different political  views.  When something is “incisive” (incisive) we mean that the person who wrote it  understands something very well; it demonstrates the intelligence of the perso n and their ability to understand something.  She means that newspaper.

Liberal, as I said before, is a political philosophy that  in modern American terms tends to want to have larger government programs, where as conservatives tend to want to have a smaller government presence.  Again, I don’t want to talk too much about that because it’s impossible to summarize it in  a short amount of time.

 Bill calls the newspaper a liberal propaganda rag.  “P ropaganda” is information that is often false that is used to try to persuade peop le to believe in a particular idea or action, especially in politics.  Bill is saying th at this newspaper is not objective – it’s not giving you the news without any sort of bias.  Instead, it is a liberal propaganda rag; it is trying to promote a cert ain political philosophy.  He says, “You can’t believe a thing (meaning you can’t believe  anything) they print in there.”  “To print” here means to publish something usu ally in a newspaper, magazine, or book.

Rachel says, “That’s not true.  The news stories are object ive and unbiased.” Rachel is defending her newspaper, saying that it is “obj ective,” meaning it’s based on the facts, it’s not just opinion.  She also says it’s “unbiased,” which is the opposite of biased – not biased.  If something is “ biased,” it has one point of view and it only reflects one point of view – one philoso phy, in this case. “Unbiased” would be something that is objective, it doesn ’t take one side of the argument over another.  Rachel says that this magazine – a nd I guess I thought she was reading a newspaper – “This magazine isn’t like the newspapers and news websites you read.  Those are run by (those are opera ted by) ultraconservative reactionaries, who only know how to write  diatribes.”  There are lots of terms, some of them insulting terms, that are us ed in American politics to describe each side of the political spectrum – each side of the political range of views.  When you say someone is an “ultraconservative,” you me an they are very, very conservative – extremely conservative, too conservati ve really.  A “reactionary” is someone who doesn’t like change and want s to go, often, back in time, without even understanding completely what’s goin g on today.  Again, this is a term that liberals in the U.S. would use to describ e conservatives and make them seem extreme.

Conservatives have their own words to describe liberals; man y times they’ll talk about the “far left”; you can also talk about the “far right.”  The far left would be people who are very extreme in their liberal views.  Con servatives would also use terms like the “loony left.”  “Loony” (loony) means sort of crazy, in this case.  So, each side has its own insulting terms that it likes to use.   Those people who are in the middle, who are not liberal or conservative, we  call “moderates” or “middle of the road,” they’re not too far on either side.

Rachel says that the magazines and newspapers that Bill rea ds only write diatribes.  A “diatribe” (diatribe) is a long written  or spoken attack on someone. When you are criticizing someone, you take a long time an d you really attack or criticize everything about that person or that view.  Rach el says, “If I only read

 the news sources you read, I would think that this world w as being ruled by liberals.”

Bill says, “The world is being ruled by liberals, at least  by the liberal press.” “Press” here means the same as media: newspapers, magazine s, radio, television, websites that are related to the news or tha t report the news.  “Press” however has several other meanings, and those can be found  in our Learning Guide.

Rachel says, “You’ve got to be kidding (meaning you’re joki ng, right)!  Our politics and our financial system are run by staunch conservati ves, who ignore any point of view other than their own.”  “Staunch” (st aunch) means very loyal, someone who is strongly supporting a certain political posi tion.  Rachel says that our politics and our financial system are run by staunch con servatives, who ignore any point of view – any opinion – other than th eir own.  “Those of us who are enlightened…”  “To be enlightened” means to have a good understanding of something, sometimes associated with perhaps more modern w ays of thinking.

Bill says, “You call yourselves enlightened?  All you and yo ur dyed-in-the-wool liberals want is to tear down old traditions.”  The ph rase “dyed (dyed)-in-the-wool (wool)” means completely involved in, extreme.  So if you  are a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, you are completely liberal, you are 100 percent  liberal.  “Wool,” you may know, is what you get from sheep that you can make clothin g from.  “Dyed” means that it is colored; you change the color of the wo ol by putting the wool into a dye, some sort of typically liquid substance.  Bill says tha t the dyed-in-the-wool liberals want to tear down old traditions.  “To tear (tear) down” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to destroy, to ruin, to take apart.   “Tradition” is the way that something has always been done by a particular culture or  a particular group of people.

Rachel says, “Yes, we do want to tear down old tradition s, old traditions that keep us (or prevent us) from making progress toward…”  Sud denly we hear from Sophia, who is Bill and Rachel’s daughter; she says, “Mom , Dad, what’s going on here?  Why are you yelling?”  Sophia sounds a lot like Ra chel because, of course, they’re related, right?  Rachel says, “Oh, it’s no thing, honey.  Go back to sleep.  Your Dad and I are just having a friendly littl e talk.”  So, the daughter wants to know why her parents are arguing, and the mot her tells her just to go back to sleep.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
