[start of dialogue]

Gabe: Why are we here? I thought we decided to put off getting a dog.

Rene: I know that’s what you’d like to do, but I th ought a trip to the pound might convince you that this is the right time to adopt a  dog. Look at this cute little dog. This card lists his breed and says that he was negl ected and abandoned. How could you turn down a face like that?

Gabe: I don’t think he’s right for us. Let’s move o n.

Rene: Look at this one. It says on his card that wh en they found him, he showed signs of abuse. Poor baby. How can you not be moved  to take this little guy home?

Gabe: Let’s keep moving.

Rene: How about this little dog? I’d hate to see th is little guy be put down. Here, pet her and look at her little face.

Gabe: This animal shelter isn’t going to put down these dogs. It’s a humane place.

Rene: They have no choice. They find so many strays  that there’s no room to keep them. It’s so sad. It’s tragic, really.

Gabe: Maybe . . .

Rene: What did you say?

Gabe: I said maybe we could take one home, maybe tw o.

Rene: Really? Two would be great, but three would b e better.

Gabe: Don’t push your luck!

Our dialogue begins with Gabe asking Rene, “Why are  we here? I thought we decided to put off getting a dog.” The phrasal verb  “to put off” here means to delay, to decide to do something later than you had  originally planned. “I’m going to put off buying a new car until next year” – I’m going to buy a new car, but I’m not going to do it right now. I’m going to put it o ff until next year.

There’s a very similar phrasal verb, “to be put off .” “To be put off” is when you are discouraged by something or have a negative reactio n to something in such a way that you decide not to do it. That’s different from this use of “put off,” which means simply to delay – to do something later than you had originally planned. Gabe thought that he and Rene had decided to put of f getting a dog.

Rene says, “I know that’s what you’d like to do, bu t I thought a trip to the pound might convince you that this is the right time to a dopt a dog.” Rene is saying that she doesn’t want to put off getting a dog. She says  that’s Gabe’s idea – and a good idea it is, if you ask me. Rene says, “I thoug ht a trip to the pound would convince you that this is the right time to adopt a  dog.” A “pound” here means an animal shelter – a place where animals are kept unt il they can be put in another home, or sometimes until they put them to sleep. “T o put a dog to sleep” means to kill a dog.

So, a dog pound would be a place where lost dogs, f or example, would be taken. The police just don’t walk around and shoot dogs wh o appear to be lost, although that might be a quick way of getting rid of them. I nstead, the dogs are taken to a pound – an “animal shelter,” as it’s also called – until either someone comes and gets the dog or, as I say, until they run out of ro om at the pound, in which case the dogs will eventually be “put to sleep,” as we l ike to say it nicely.

Rene wants to adopt a dog. The verb “to adopt” (ado pt) means to officially make – in this case, the dog – part of your family. We u se the same verb when we’re talking about babies. If you adopt a baby, you make  that baby, or that child, part of your family. We also use that same verb when we’ re talking about an

organization, such as the government, deciding to f ollow some new rule or to establish some new law. We talk about a government “adopting” certain laws. They approve them, and they put them into use.

Rene then says, “Look at this cute little dog. This  card lists his breed and says he was neglected and abandoned.” The “card” is a littl e piece of paper, we’re guessing, that is attached to the dog’s cage, where  they keep the dog. The card lists his “breed” (breed). The “breed” of the dog is the specific type of dog that it is. We actually use this word for a lot of differen t kinds of animals when we’re talking about a specific kind of, in this case, dog  or cat or horse. We don’t talk about breeds when we’re talking about human beings,  however – at least, not in the same way.

Rene says this particular dog has been “neglected a nd abandoned.” “To neglect” (neglect) means to ignore or not take care of somet hing or someone. So, if the dog has been neglected, the dog has not been taken care of properly – perhaps he’s sick or doesn’t have enough food.

“Abandoned” comes from the verb “to abandon,” which  means to leave something or someone and basically walk away from it, decide you’re not going to bother with it anymore. You don’t sell it. You d on’t give it to someone. You just leave it somewhere and hope that someone else finds  it and takes it – or not. You may not care. If a dog has been abandoned, the owner of the dog decides he doesn’t want the dog anymore and, I don’t know, puts them in a park and then drives away, I guess.

Rene says, “How could you turn down a face like tha t?” “To turn down” is a two- word phrasal verb meaning to say no to something or  to someone. “To reject” or “to deny,” are also possible definitions of this ph rasal verb “to turn down.” “I asked the beautiful girl out on a date and she turn ed me down.” She turned down my invitation. She said no. That used to happen a l ot to me. It doesn’t happen anymore, of course, because I’m married.

Rene is trying to get Gabe, of course, to adopt a c ute-looking dog. Gabe says, “I don’t think he’s right for us, let’s move on” – let ’s keep looking. Gabe doesn’t like this particular dog. Rene then says, “Look at this one. It says on his card that when they found him, he showed signs of abuse.” “Ab use” (abuse) is when someone treats you badly, or in this case, treats a  dog badly. They may hit them. They may hurt them. They may do other things that h arm them emotionally or physically. Notice that the verb is “to abuse” and the noun is “abuse.” The “s” is unvoiced in the noun form, for those of you who are  interested in that sort of thing.

 Rene says, “Poor baby.” “Poor baby” is something yo u might say when you feel sorry for a young child, or in this case, a dog. Yo u might also say it to an adult. “Oh, poor baby” – but when we do that, we are often  being sarcastic. We’re making a joke. Rene says, “How can you not be moved  to take this little guy home?” How can you not be moved to take the dog hom e? “To be moved” to do something means to feel a very strong emotion that makes you want to act or behave in a certain way. In this case, Rene is trying to get Gabe to bring the dog – “the little guy,” as she calls him – home.

Gabe again says, “Let’s keep moving.” Rene then say s, “How about this little dog? I’d hate to see this little guy be put down.” “To put down” an animal means the same as to put an animal to sleep. It means to kill the animal. Once again, Rene refers to the animal by saying “this little gu y.” “Guy” is normally a word we use for human beings, and perhaps that’s why Rene u ses it here. She’s trying to get Gabe to feel sorry for this dog.

She then says, “Here, pet her and look at her littl e face.” Now she talks about her as a “her.” The word “guy” is usually used to refer  to a boy or a man, unless it’s plural. If you say “guys,” you could be referring to a group of men or boys, or a group of both men and women, or boys and girls.

But in any case, Rene is inviting Gabe to pet the d og. “To pet” (pet), as a verb, means to gently touch the dog with your hand, usual ly on the top. That’s “petting.” Notice that as a noun, the word “pet” (p et) refers to an actual animal that you keep usually in your house, like a dog and  a cat. Here it’s used as a verb, and it means to caress or to gently touch an animal with your hand, usually touching its “fur” (fur), which is its hair.

Gabe says, “This animal shelter isn’t going to put down these dogs.” He’s saying that the pound – the animal shelter – will not kill  the dogs. “It’s a humane place.” The word “humane” (humane) means not harming other people, or in this case, dogs. The word obviously comes from the word “human ,” but we use it in talking not just about humans and being nice to humans, bei ng kind to humans, but also when talking about animals. In fact, there is somet hing called, I think, the Humane Society. This is a group of people who are n ot interested in humans, but interested in animals and making sure people are no t cruel or mean to animals. People like me.

Rene says, “They have no choice,” meaning the anima l shelter will not have a choice about putting the dogs down. “They find so m any strays that there is no

room to keep them.” A “stray” (stray), as a noun, is an animal like a dog or a cat that has been abandoned and doesn’t have a place to  stay or a place to live.

Rene says, “It’s so sad. It’s tragic, really.” The word “tragic” (tragic) means very sad, something that is very “distressful,” we might  say. Once again, Rene is trying to convince Gabe that they should adopt a do g. Gabe says, “Maybe.” Rene says, “What did you say?” Gabe replies, “I said may be we could take one home, maybe two.” So, he’s saying it’s possible for us to  adopt one or even two dogs.

Rene says, “Really?” She’s very surprised. “Two wou ld be great, but three would be better.” Rene is saying that adopting two dogs w ould be wonderful, but what would be even better, what would be even more wonde rful, is if they adopted three dogs. Remember, Gabe didn’t even want to adop t one dog when the dialogue began. Gabe says to Rene, “Don’t push your  luck.” “To push (push) your luck” means to try very hard to make something  happen after you’ve already achieved something good. It means to take things to o far.

So, when your son or daughter asks to use the car, perhaps because they don’t own their own car, you say, “Okay, you can use it, but you have to return it by ten o’clock tonight.” Your son or daughter might say, “ Oh, can I stay out until midnight?” Can I return it at midnight? You might s ay to them, “Don’t push your luck,” meaning you’ve already been lucky. You’ve al ready gotten something you want. Don’t try to get more than that because you m ight lose both things. You might have the favor that was granted, or given you , taken away.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
