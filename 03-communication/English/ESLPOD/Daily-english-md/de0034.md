Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 34: Doing Hair and Getting Dressed

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 34. I'm your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development, in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

In this episode, we're going to see Lucy do her hai r and get dressed. Let's get started.

[Start of story]

I go back into the bathroom to finish doing my hair .  Before I put the hot curlers in, I had put a little gel in my hair to give it so me volume.  I also like to use my hairdryer to give my bangs a little more shape.  I take out the curlers one by one and brush through them into the style I like.  I fi nish it off with a little hairspray and I’m ready to get dressed.

In my bedroom, I look in my closet for a skirt and blouse to match.  The office I work in is pretty casual so I don’t need to wear a suit to work.  On Fridays, we’re allowed to be even more casual so most people wear jeans and sweaters to the office, but no one dares to show up in t-shirts and  shorts.  I put on the skirt and blouse and open the top dresser drawer to get some pantyhose.  I wish I could wear my tennis shoes to work, but I pick out a pair  of heels and put them on.  I was ready to go.

Lucy begins by going "into the bathroom to finish d oing" her "hair."  To do your hair means to make your hair look nice.  We may als o say, "to fix your hair," but the most common expression is "to do your hair."  W ell, if you remember from a previous episode, Lucy had put hot curlers, or hot rollers.  A roller, "roller," is another name for a curler, and those are things tha t women put in their hair so that their hair is not straight, it has curls in it .

Lucy now needs "to finish doing" her "hair."  She s ays that "Before" she "put the hot rollers," or the hot curlers, "in," she "had pu t a little gel in" her "hair to give it some extra volume."  Gel, "gel," is a thick liquid that you put on your hair.

Sometimes you put it on your hair because you want your hair to go in a certain way - you want it to be flat, for example, you put the gel on top.  It's a thick liquid.

When I was in high school, back in the 1950s, it wa s very popular for high school students to have gel - a type of gel in their hair.   Maybe one of the more famous movies in the United States about 1950s and 1960s i n high school was called Grease, "Grease."  And in Grease, which starred, I think, Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta - I'm not sure, I, as a man, have not  watched it as much as most American girls and women have - but in the movie, I  remember that the boys had gel - a type of gel on their hair to make it very f lat on their head.

Getting back to Lucy, she says that she "put a litt le gel in" her "hair to give it some" extra "volume."  Volume, "volume," means she made it thicker, or fuller, or bigger.  To add volume to your hair means to make i t thicker.

She also likes "to use" her "hair dryer to give" he r "bangs a little more shape." Bangs, "bangs," (always plural) is the hair that is  on the part of your head above your eyes, between your eyes and the top of your he ad.  We call that part of your head your forehead, "forehead."  So, bangs are hair  that goes over your forehead.

Lucy is trying "to give" her "bangs little more sha pe," that is she doesn't want them just flat; she wants to give them a different shape than what they have right now.  So, she takes "out the curlers," meaning she removes the curlers from her hair, "one by one" and brushes her hair into the st yle that she likes.  To brush, "brush," as a verb, means to take something and put  it through your hair so that your hair goes in a certain direction.  The noun br ush, "brush," is the thing that you put in your hair.  We also use the word brush f or someone who is painting. The thing you use to put paint on wall or on a pict ure; that would be also called a brush, a paintbrush.  This is a hairbrush.

Lucy likes to "finish it off," meaning she likes to  finish doing her hair, "with a little hairspray."  Hairspray, "hairspray," (one word) is liquid that you put on a large area.  In order to make the liquid go in a larger a rea, you spray it on, and you spray it by using something called a nozzle.  The b ottle that has the hairspray, on the top has a nozzle, "nozzle," and a nozzle is som ething that takes the liquid and spreads it out - puts it over a wider area.

So, this is hairspray that Lucy is putting on her h ead.  It's a liquid that keeps the hair in the same place so that if you go outside in  the wind, your hair doesn't get, we'd say, messed up.  To mess, "mess," up your hair  means that your hair goes

in a different style or it moves so that it doesn't  look good.  Again, if you don't have hair like me, you don't have to worry about th is!

Lucy goes into her bedroom and looks in her closet for a skirt and a blouse to wear.  A closet, "closet," is a space in your bedro om where you can keep your clothes.  The clothes that you put in a closet are usually ones that you hang, "hang."  To hang your clothes means to put them on something so that the clothes are not folded, they are vertical and they are hanging down from a bar - a pole that is at the top of your closet.  The thing you put your clothes on is called a hanger, "hanger."

So, you put your clothes, or you hang your clothes on a clothes hanger, and you put them into your closet.  Closets can also just b e places to store things - to keep things.  It's like a big box in your room, but  it's very tall, usually as tall as the person or taller.

In Lucy's closet, she's looking for a skirt and a b louse that match.  Remember, to match means the clothes have the similar or same co lors.  A skirt, "skirt," is a piece of clothing that goes around a woman's waist - in the middle of her body - and then it goes down and covers the top of her leg s, or perhaps all of her legs. You can have a long skirt that goes all the way dow n to the bottom of your leg; you could have a short skirt that goes up only cove ring the top of your legs.

Lucy's looking for a skirt and a blouse.  A blouse,  "blouse," is a special kind of shirt that a woman wears.  Usually it is a shirt th at has a collar, "collar," on the top.  A collar is the part of the shirt near the ne ck, and it makes the shirt look a little more formal.  A woman's blouse also usually has buttons in the front so that when you put the blouse on, you put the buttons tog ether to keep the shirt on your body.  We say you fasten the buttons, "fasten. "  You fasten the buttons so that the shirt stays on.  Buttons are little pieces  of plastic or metal that go usually through a hole and that keeps the shirt on.  A men' s formal shirt would also have buttons and a collar; for a woman, we call it a blo use.

Lucy says, "The office" she works "in is pretty cas ual," or very casual.  To be casual, "casual," means to be less formal - to be i nformal - to be more relaxed. Because Lucy works in an office that is casual, she  doesn't "need to wear a suit to work."  A suit "suit," for a woman is a formal p iece, or a formal set of clothing, usually with a blouse, and then you have a jacket o ver the blouse, and then you have a nice skirt or pants that go with the jacket;  this is a suit.  For men, when they wear a suit, usually they have shirt, pants, j acket, and a tie.

Lucy says that "On Fridays," she is "allowed to be even more casual," and many people at her work "wear jeans and sweaters to the office."  To wear means to have on your body.  Jeans, "jeans," are a popular t ype of informal pants. Perhaps the most famous type of jeans are Levi's, a nd they're usually blue, and sometimes black.  Sweaters, "sweaters," are like ve ry warm shirts - shirts that keep you warm.  Often, you put a shirt on and then if you are cold you put a sweater on top of your shirt.

Lucy says, "no one dares to show up in t-shirts and  shorts."  The expression to dare, "dare," to do something means that no one att empts to do that.  The verb, to dare to, means that it is something that you sho uldn't do or it is something that is risky, you could get in trouble.  Your mother ma y say, "Don't you dare go to the movies tonight," she would mean you better not - yo u are not allowed to go to the movie, if you do, you will be in big trouble - you will have a lot of problems from me.

Well, the story says that "no one" at Lucy's work " dares to show up" or to go to work "in t-shirts and shorts."  T-shirts, "t-shirts ," are shirts that you wear that don't have a collar that are very informal.  Shorts, "sho rts," are like pants but they do not go to the bottom of your leg.  They only go and  cover the top of your leg, those would be shorts.

Lucy puts "on a skirt and a blouse and opens the to p dresser drawer to get some pantyhose."  A dresser, "dresser," is a place where  you can keep clothing such as socks, underwear, shirts, perhaps some pants.  Y ou have to fold your clothes up - you have to put the clothes together and put t hem in the drawer. Remember, in the closet, you hang your clothes ofte n; in a dresser, you put your clothes in a little box, which we call a drawer, "d rawer."  So, a dresser is a piece of furniture that has several drawers, or several b oxes that you can pull out and put clothing into.

Pantyhose, "pantyhose," (one word) is like a combin ation of a pair of pants and a sock.  It's something that women put on.  Usually i t goes over their feet and goes all the way up to their waist, and then they put a skirt on so that it covers the top part of their legs.  Again, this is something only worn by a woman.  Pantyhose are usually a color that is brown or a color of you r skin, and they're a more formal type of clothing.  You would use pantyhose for goin g to a business meeting if you were a woman.  If you were a man, you wouldn't wear  pantyhose unless you wanted to look like a woman, but that's a different  story!

Lucy says she wishes she "could wear" her "tennis s hoes to work."  She wishes she could is a conditional construction, "I wish I could."  I wish I could wear my tennis shoes."  Tennis, "tennis," is, you probably know, a sport, but tennis shoes are the kinds of shoes you wear to go running or to  play sports or to walk around your neighborhood, you would put on tennis shoes.

Lucy can't "wear tennis shoes to work," so she has to "pick out," or select, "a pair of heels" to put on.  Heels, "heels," refers here t o a pair of shoes that have a little stick at the back of the shoe that makes the woman taller.  We sometimes called these high heels.  So, Lucy puts on a pair of high heels, or a pair of heels, and now she's ready to go to work.

Now let's listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.
