# English Wordbook Establishment Method

To establish an English wordbook while reading the Daily English MD files, I recommend the following systematic approach, leveraging the structure suggested in `README-Improvement-Guide.md` and the tracking capabilities of `progress-tracking-template.md`:

## Wordbook Establishment Method:

1.  **Active Vocabulary Identification:** As you read each `deXXXX.md` file, actively identify new or challenging vocabulary and phrases. Focus on the terms highlighted in the "Explanation" section, and especially those suggested to be bolded in the `README-Improvement-Guide.md`.
2.  **Contextual Extraction:** For each identified word/phrase, extract its definition and an example sentence directly from the text. Understanding the word in its original context is crucial.
3.  **Personalized Application:** Beyond the provided examples, create your own unique example sentence or a brief "application scenario" that reflects how you might use the word in your daily life or in a conversation. This personal connection aids memorization.
4.  **Self-Assessment Questions:** Formulate a "test question" for each entry. This question should prompt you to recall the meaning or use the word/phrase in a new context, facilitating active recall.
5.  **Difficulty Rating:** Assign a subjective difficulty rating (e.g., using stars like ★☆☆ for easy, ★★★ for medium, ★★★★★ for hard). This helps prioritize review.
6.  **Structured Recording:** Utilize a Markdown table format, similar to the "詞彙突破 (Vocabulary Breakthroughs)" section in `progress-tracking-template.md`. You can maintain a single comprehensive wordbook file or create separate ones per thematic unit.
7.  **Regular Spaced Repetition:** Crucially, integrate a review schedule. The `progress-tracking-template.md` already includes "複習狀態 (Review Status)" and a "週度複習系統 (Weekly Review System)". Regularly revisit your wordbook entries, focusing on those marked for review or higher difficulty.

## Demonstration (Extracting from `de0001.md`):

Here are a few vocabulary entries extracted from `de0001.md` and formatted as a wordbook entry:

| 日期 | 單元 | 新學詞彙/片語 | 測試問題 | 難度 | 應用場景 | 複習狀態 |
|------|------|--------------|----------|------|----------|----------|
| 8/20 | DE0001 | born and raised | "我在台北出生長大"用英語怎麼說？ | ★★☆ | 自我介紹時描述籍貫和成長地 | 待複習 |
| 8/20 | DE0001 | native (of) | native of 和 native to 的區別是什麼？ | ★★★ | 描述某人或某物原產地或出身地 | 待複習 |
| 8/20 | DE0001 | spoiled | 如何用spoiled描述一個被寵壞的孩子？ | ★★☆ | 討論育兒方式或描述某人性格 | 待複習 |
| 8/20 | DE0001 | for the most part | "For the most part" 在句中通常表示什麼意思？ | ★★☆ | 總結或概括大部分情況 | 待複習 |
| 8/20 | DE0001 | deprived | 描述一個人感到"deprived"是什麼感覺？ | ★★★ | 討論資源匱乏或心理感受 | 待複習 |
| 8/20 | DE0001 | learn the ropes | 剛到新公司，你需要"learn the ropes"是什麼意思？ | ★★★★ | 學習新環境或新工作的規則和流程 | 待複習 |
| 8/20 | DE0001 | Better late than never | "Better late than never" 這句話通常在什麼情況下使用？ | ★☆☆ | 鼓勵或安慰那些遲到但最終完成任務的人 | 待複習 |

This structured approach ensures that you not only identify new words but also actively engage with them, understand their usage, and plan for effective review, leading to better retention and application in your English learning journey.
