It’s time to upgrade to a big-screen TV and this is the perfect place to buy one.  Nelly:  They certainly have a large selection.  These new TVs have pictures that are much sharper than our current one.  Byung:  There’s no comparison.  These new TVs have a much better resolution.  Just look at the brightness and the contrast!  Our old TV looks washed out by comparison.  Nelly:  And listen to that sound quality.  It’s like being in a movie theater with surround sound.  Byung:  Yeah, it’s time we moved into the 21st century.  Nelly:  According to what I’ve read, with a viewing distance of 10 feet, we should look for a screen size of about 40 inches.  Byung:  I was thinking more like a 60-inch screen.  Nelly:  A 60-inch TV?!  That would take up the entire living room wall.    Byung:  That’s exactly what I had in mind!
