This episode is a dialogue between Simone and Dirk about people who are perhaps a little more direct – a little more honest  than you would want them to be.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Simone:  So, what did you think of Bruce?  Isn’t he  great?

Dirk:  Well, he’s certainly direct and forthright w ith his opinions.  I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who speaks his mind the way he does .

Simone:  Yeah, isn’t that great?  I’ve never liked a guy who straddles the fence or has namby-pamby opinions.  I’ve always liked guys w ith strong opinions.

Dirk:  Well, there’s strong and there’s pigheadedne ss.  Don’t you think?

Simone:  What?!  You think Bruce is pigheaded, just  because he doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him?  I think that’s an admirable trait.

Dirk:  I think being blunt can be admirable under t he right circumstances, but being stubborn as a mule can make it hard on other people, don’t you think?

Simone:  No, I don’t.  Other people can pull their punches if they want to, but a man who’ll speak up about what he believes in and s tand by it is a real man to me.

Dirk:  I can see why you two make a perfect couple.   I hope never to be on the wrong side of an argument with either one of you.

Simone begins by saying to Dirk, “So, what do you t hink of Bruce?” meaning what is your opinion of Bruce.  “Isn’t he great?”  Isn’t he wonderful?  Dirk says, “Well, he’s certainly direct and forthright in his opinions.”  “To be direct” here means to give your opinion without trying to be nic e to the other person; you tell them exactly what you are thinking even if it might  hurt them a little.  “Direct” has several meanings in English however; take a look at  our Learning Guide for some more of those.  “To be forthright” (forthright  – one word) is the same as “direct.”  To be “outspoken” or “bold” are other sy nonyms – other words similar to this word of “forthright.”  He says, “I don’t think  I’ve ever met anyone who speaks his mind the way he does.”  “To speak your mind” is  an expression that means to share your opinion even if other people have a diff erent opinion.  I speak my mind on the podcast sometimes.  The idea is usually  that maybe some people disagree with you, about cats or my neighbors’ chil dren for example.

Simone says, “Yeah, isn’t that great?  I’ve never l iked a guy who straddles the fence or has namby-pamby opinions.”  “To straddle ( straddle) the fence” is an expression that means to be indecisive, not to be a ble to decide what you want or what you believe because you’re able to see the pluses and minuses – the advantages and disadvantages of both sides.  So, yo u don’t make up your mind; you don’t give your opinion because you’re not quit e sure.  Simone says that she doesn’t like guys – men – who straddle the fence; s he doesn’t like men who have namby-pamby opinions, either.  “Namby (namby) -pamb y (pamby)” means not to be able to make a clear decision, to be indecisive.   It’s definitely a negative way of describing someone who doesn’t make a decision, who sits back and says, “Well, maybe yes, maybe no.”  “To straddle the fenc e” is more neutral; that is, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re criticizing the per son.  But “namby-pamby” – and those two words are not used in any other conte xt in English that I know – “namby-pamby” is definitely a negative way to descr ibe someone.

Simone says, “I’ve always liked guys with strong op inions.”  Dirk says, “Well, there’s strong and then there’s pigheadedness.”  We ll there’s a couple of things going on in that expression, or that sentence.  Dir k says that there is something called “pigheadedness.”  This is a long word, all o ne word: “pig…headed…ness.” “To be pigheaded” means to not change your opinion,  to be stubborn.  You won’t change your opinion no matter what other people say .  We can describe someone as being pigheaded, and that is definitely a negative way to describe them.  Why pigs?  I don’t know, but that’s the expr ession.  So, “pigheadedness” is the state of or the condition of being stubborn.   Dirk says, “there’s strong and there’s pigheadedness.”  We might more commonly say , “there’s strong and then there’s pigheadedness.”  That construction – that s tructure of “there’s

(something) and then there’s (something else)” is u sed to emphasize how one word seems to be okay but the second word – the sec ond concept is definitely negative.  So being strong, in your opinion, that’s  okay.  But being pigheaded, that’s not okay.  Another example: “There’s dieting  and then there’s anorexia.” “To diet” means not to eat food because you are try ing to lose weight.  “Anorexia” is a disease that causes you to not want to eat, an d that can be very dangerous to your health; it can make you sick, it can even k ill you.  So, the first term is positive or neutral, the second one is negative.  T here’s something and then there’s something else, and the something else is a lways negative.  So Dirk says, “there’s strong and then there’s pigheadednes s.  Don’t you think?”

Simone says, “What?!  You think Bruce is pigheaded,  just because he doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him?”  Simone i s obviously upset by Dirk’s comment.  She says that he isn’t pigheaded just he doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him.  “To budge” (budge) means t o move when you are pushed.  In this case, it means to change your opin ion when you get new information; someone tells you something and you ch ange your mind.  But if someone tells you something and you still do not ch ange your mind we might say that you won’t budge, you won’t change your opinion .  “To sway” (sway) here means to persuade or convince someone to consider a nother idea or to have a different opinion – to change someone’s opinion.  S imone says that Bruce doesn’t budge when other people try to sway him – t ry to change his opinion. She thinks that that is an admirable trait.  Someth ing that is “admirable” is something you admire.  That’s where the word comes from; (admire) is the verb, “admire.”  “Admirable” is the adjective, someone wh o you have a high opinion of, who you respect.  A “trait” (trait) is a characteri stic, a feature, an aspect of someone’s personality, the way someone acts.  You c ould say that he is an honest person or he is a confident person or he is a generous person, he gives his money to other people who need it.  Those are t raits, for most people admirable traits.

Dirk says, “I think being blunt can be admirable un der the right circumstances, but being stubborn as a mule can make it hard on ot her people, don’t you think?” Dirk is defending himself here.  He’s saying that b eing blunt – that is, being direct – is okay.  It’s okay to be forthright, direct, blu nt, but to be stubborn as a mule can make it hard on other people.  A “mule” (mule) is the offspring – is the child – of a horse and a donkey.  They are used as animals usually for transporting or moving things or pulling things.  Well, the idea is  that mules are stubborn, like donkeys are stubborn; they don’t change their mind,  they don’t like to be moved. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but that’s the expression.  So, “to be stubborn as a mule” means to be very stubborn, not to want to c hange your mind ever.  Dirk

says that that can make it hard on other people; it  can be difficult when you are working with other people.

Simone does not agree.  She says, “Other people can  pull their punches if they want to, but a man who’ll speak up about what he be lieves in and stands by it is a real man to me.”  “To pull your punches” means no t to be as forceful as you could.  Someone who could be more powerful or more forceful could perhaps damage someone else or hurt someone else more, but they decide not to.  The expression comes from boxing.  “Boxing” is a sport where two people – usually men, who try to hit each other with their fists – w ith their hands and their arms.  A “punch” is when you actually hit another person wit h your fist, which is your hand closed up tight.  “To pull your punches” would be n ot to hit as hard as you could; that’s where the expression, I believe, comes from.   Simone says that other people may do that, but she wants a man who will speak up about what he believes in.  “To speak up” is a two-word phrasal v erb to meaning to say your opinion even when it is unpopular or no one wants t o hear it.  Simone says that Bruce, who I guess is her boyfriend or someone she perhaps wants to be her boyfriend, speaks up about what he believes in and stands by it.  “To stand by (something or someone)” means to be committed to it , to continue to believe in something or someone even when they are unpopular, even when things are going badly for them.  Simone says that Bruce stand s by his opinions; he doesn’t change them because they are unpopular.

Dirk says, “I can see why you two make a perfect co uple.”  That is, why you are a good match, a good pair of people to be together.  “I hope never to be on the wrong side of an argument with either one of you.”  “To be on the wrong side of an argument” means to disagree with another person,  to have an argument with another person.  Normally when we say you’re on the  wrong side of something, means that you’re wrong or that you are in a positi on or a situation that will probably lose – that will not be the winning situat ion.  You may talk about someone being on the wrong side of history, meaning  they’re supporting an opinion or an idea that in many years people will c onsider wrong, for example.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
