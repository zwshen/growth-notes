[start of dialog]

Ariel:  I know you’ll give me the inside scoop.  Wh at’s going on between Sam and Matt?

Paolo:  You’re asking the wrong person.

Ariel:  Don’t be like that.  You know both of them really well, and I know that Sam confides in you.  Don’t you think Matt is being unr easonable?

Paolo:  I really couldn’t say.

Ariel:  Why are you being so close-mouthed?  I’m su re you have an opinion.

Paolo:  I’ve never given it much thought, to be hon est, and I don’t think it’s any of my business.

Ariel:  But they’re both friends of yours.  You mus t have at least speculated on what’s happening.  It’s only human.  Do you think S am is going to leave Matt?

Paolo:  Your guess is as good as mine.  I really do n’t know anything and don’t have an opinion either way!

Ariel:  That’s just not possible.  Okay, okay, what  do you think is going on between Michaela and Carlos?

Paolo:  Ugh!

Ariel begins by saying to Paolo, “I’ll know you’ll give me the inside scoop.” The expression “inside scoop” (scoop) means secret info rmation that not everyone else knows. “Scoop” can sometimes be used in the wo rld of journalism, in newspapers, for example, to describe a story that o ne newspaper gets before any of the other newspapers get it. That would be a  scoop. An “inside scoop” is some secret about some situation that no one else k nows about, but that someone tells you. Ariel wants Paolo to give her the inside scoop.

She says, “What’s going on between Sam and Matt?” “ What’s going on” means what’s the problem, what’s the story, what is happe ning. Paolo says, “You’re asking the wrong person.” When someone says, “You’r e asking the wrong person,” they’re telling you that you don’t have an y information about that situation. You are not the person to ask or simply,  you don’t know.

Ariel says, “Don’t be like that.” That phrase “Don’ t be like that” is used to change someone’s behavior or attitude or to stop someone f rom doing something, usually something you don’t like. You want the pers on to be more helpful to you. In this case, Paolo does not want to answer Ariel’s  question and Ariel is asking him to change his attitude, to change his behavior – “Don’t be like that.”

“You know both of them really well,” she says, “and  I know that Sam confides in you.” “To confide (confide) in someone” is to trust  someone, to tell that person your secrets, your personal thoughts. Ariel says th at Sam confides in Paolo. “Don’t you think Matt is being unreasonable?” she a sks. “To be unreasonable” is to be not reasonable. “Reasonable” is rational, log ical; not reasonable, “unreasonable,” is illogical or irrational.

Paolo says, “I really couldn’t say.” This expressio n “I really couldn’t say” again means I don’t know or I’m not sure. We use it when we don’t really want to answer someone’s question. Someone asks us a questi on and we don’t really want to give them the answer, but we don’t want to lie to them. We might say, “I really couldn’t say.” That doesn’t exactly mean you  don’t know. It may really mean that you don’t want to say but you’re implying  that you’re not really sure.

Ariel says, “Why are you being so close-mouthed?” “ Close-mouthed” (mouthed) means you do not want to give someone information. You don’t want to talk about a certain topic. Paolo is being close-mouthed  with Ariel. She says, “I’m sure you have an opinion,” meaning I’m sure you hav e an idea, something that you think about the situation.

 Paolo responds, “I’ve never given it much thought, to be honest.” When you say you’ve never given something much thought, you’re s aying that you haven’t spent a lot of time thinking about it. It hasn’t be en something that has been worrying you, and therefore you don’t really have a n opinion about it. “I haven’t given it much thought” can mean “I haven’t thought about it enough to make a decision.” Or it could mean “I don’t really know, I  don’t care that much, and therefore I don’t have a strong opinion about the s ituation.”

Paolo says, “I don’t think it’s any of my business. ” This is a very important phrase – “to be of your business,” as in when someone says , “It’s not any of your business,” or “It’s not any of my business,” means it’s not something that you should  be concerned about. It’s not something that affect s you personally, and therefore it’s not something you should be talking about or asking about. The related expression here is, “It’s none of your busi ness.” That’s a very strong thing to say to someone who’s asking you about something that you don’t think they have any right to know. It’s not something that con cerns them. It’s a rather strong statement, however, when you say, “It’s none of you r business.” That is really saying, “You are doing something you should not.” I t’s definitely a criticism of someone. When you say, “It isn’t any of my business ,” however, you’re just saying, “Well, that’s not my concern and therefore I don’t know anything about it and I don’t think I should know anything about it.”

Ariel says, “But they’re both friends of yours. You  must have speculated on what’s happening.” “To speculate (speculate) on som ething” means to think about something and to have an opinion about it eve n though you don’t have any evidence, even though you don’t have any strong wha t we would call “proof” (proof) – something that tells you for sure whether  this is true or that is true. “To speculate on something is to think about it without  having all of the information you really need in order to have an opinion. It’s a  guess about what is happening. Often, that is of course, a very bad idea.

Ariel says, “It’s only human.” “It’s only human” he re is used to talk about negative things that everyone does, even if they don’t want to or aren’t supposed to. It’s only human that you get angry when the waiter is no t nice to you. We’re not saying that it’s a good thing to get angry at the w aiter. It isn’t, but it’s only human. We can understand because that’s what happens to us  weak human beings.

Ariel says, “Do you think Sam is going to leave Mat t?” (Sam can also be short for Samantha, a woman’s name.) Ariel wants to know if S am is going to leave Matt. “To leave someone” here means to end a romantic rel ationship with that person. “To break up with someone” is another way of saying  that.

 Paolo says, “Your guess is as good as mine.” The ex pression “Your guess is as good as mine” means that you don’t have any more in formation about it than the person you’re talking to. “I don’t know. Your guess  is as good as mine.” You don’t know. I don’t know. We’re both guessing. Either of us could be right.

He then says, “I really don’t know anything and don ’t have an opinion either way. “Either way” here means either for or against somet hing. There could be two possibilities but you’re not sure which is correct.  We might say, for example, of a game, “It could go either way.” Team A could win or  Team B could win. You’re not really sure. In this case, Paolo doesn’t have a n opinion either way, meaning he doesn’t know whether the two people are going to  stay together or break up.

Ariel says, “That’s just not possible. Okay. Okay. What do you think is going on between Michaela and Carlos?” Immediately Ariel ask s Paolo’s opinion about another couple, another two people, and wants to kn ow what Paolo thinks of them. Paolo just says, “Ugh,” which is a sound that  you would make when you are frustrated or upset or tired of this person ask ing you this question or talking to you about this situation. And that definitely is wh at is happening to Paolo.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time, at a normal speed.

[start of dialog]

Ariel:  I know you’ll give me the inside scoop.  Wh at’s going on between Sam and Matt?

Paolo:  You’re asking the wrong person.

Ariel:  Don’t be like that.  You know both of them really well, and I know that Sam confides in you.  Don’t you think Matt is being unr easonable?

Paolo:  I really couldn’t say.

Ariel:  Why are you being so close-mouthed?  I’m su re you have an opinion.

Paolo:  I’ve never given it much thought, to be hon est, and I don’t think it’s any of my business.

Ariel:  But they’re both friends of yours.  You mus t have at least speculated on what’s happening.  It’s only human.  Do you think S am is going to leave Matt?

Paolo:  Your guess is as good as mine.  I really do n’t know anything and don’t have an opinion either way!

Ariel:  That’s just not possible.  Okay, okay, what  do you think is going on between Michaela and Carlos?

Paolo:  Ugh!

I won’t be close-mouthed about my opinion of who the greatest scriptwriter on the Internet is. I think it’s Dr. Lucy Tse.
