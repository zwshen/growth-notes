This episode is a dialogue about renting or paying to use, temporarily, equipment for your business. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Olena: We need to keep pace with changing technolog y, but how are we going to raise capital to upgrade our equipment?

Joel: I’m not sure. Maybe we can find a supplier wh o will extend credit to us. We can pay in installments.

Olena: That’ll be hard to do. No one wants to exten d credit these days.

Joel: I know what my brother did when his company n eeded new equipment.

Olena: What?

Joel: He leased it instead of buying it.

Olena: Leasing equipment? I’ve never considered it.  I don’t want to end up paying more for the equipment over time than it’s w orth, and still not own the equipment at the end of the contract.

Joel: The flip side is that you won’t be saddled wi th outdated equipment that’s hard to off-load. My brother says that there are ot her advantages to leasing. You can have the maintenance included in your contract,  so you won’t have to worry about high repair bills.

Olena: I don’t know . . .

Joel: And my brother also told me that he was able to negotiate a purchase option. You can do the same if you really want to o wn the equipment.

Olena: Your brother really seems to know what he’s talking about. Why isn’t he working for me?

Joel: You have someone even better. You have an emp loyee who listens and steals the competitors’ good ideas.

Olena begins by saying to Joel, “We need to keep pa ce with changing technology.” “To keep pace (pace) with” something m eans to do as well as this other thing is doing, or to move as quickly as, or we might use another phrasal verb: “to keep up with” something else. In this cas e, Olena is talking about keeping pace with changing technology. The idea her e is that as technology changes, so we too must change. We have to adapt to  this new technology.

Olena says, “How are we going to raise capital to u pgrade our equipment?” “To raise capital” (capital) means to get money to do s omething for a business. When you want to start a large new project, you might ne ed to raise capital. You might need to go to a bank or to investors and have them give you money so that you can do this new project. You can also raise capital  for other things that are not part of a business, but the idea is that it’s for a  large project.

Olena wants to raise capital to “upgrade” their equ ipment. “To upgrade” (upgrade) means to get a newer version of something . We can talk about upgrading our software on our computers. We get the  latest version, the newest version. And there’s always a newer version, right?  “Equipment” refers to machines that we use for a particular purpose. It’s  a very general term. It could refer to a computer. It might also refer, in sports  for example, to a ball or a hockey stick. That’s sporting equipment. Here, we’r e talking about business equipment – things you would use in your business. It might be a computer. It might be a fax machine. It might be some machine th at makes something.

Joel says, “I’m not sure” – I’m not sure how we’re going to raise capital. “Maybe we can find a supplier who will extend credit to us .” A “supplier” (supplier) is a company that sells to other companies – sells, typi cally, equipment to other companies. “To extend (extend) credit” means to all ow someone to get something they’re buying from you before they give you any money. If you’re buying a car from me, I might say, “Okay, here’s the car, and pay me back in the

next two months.” I’m extending credit to you. I’m saying, “You can use this and pay me later.” That’s what Joel wants to do to get this new business equipment.

He says, “We can pay in installments.” “To pay in i nstallments” is to pay a little bit over a long period of time. So, if you owe someone $10,000, you may pay them a thousand dollars a month for ten months. That would  be paying in installments. Of course, that would be without interest. You migh t have to pay more with interest.

Olena says, “That will be hard to do” – that will b e difficult. “No one wants to extend credit these days.” “These days” means nowad ays or currently, in this time period that we’re in now. Joel says, “I know w hat my brother did when his company needed new equipment.” Olena says, “What?” – what did your brother do? Joel says, “He leased it instead of buying it.”  “To lease” (lease) means to use something for a short period of time and pay someon e to use it for that period of time. When that period of time is over – it might b e a month, it might be a year, it might be five years – then you have to give whateve r you are leasing back. You have to give whatever you are using back to the per son who you got it from and who you were paying. “Lease” is very similar to ano ther word: “rent.” We can talk about “leasing” or “renting.” We often use the two words interchangeably, one for the other. When we’re talking about equipment, howe ver, especially in a business situation, we would probably use the word “lease.” “Rent” might be used for, for example, “renting a car” or “renting a house,” although you can also “lease” a house. It just depends on the situation. In this case though, “lease” is probably more common for business purposes.

Olena says, “Leasing equipment? I’ve never consider ed it” – I never thought about it. “I don’t want to end up paying more for t he equipment over time than it’s worth.” “To end up” is a two-word phrasal verb that ’s very common in English. It means to have to do something at the end of a certa in period of time, or to be in a certain kind of situation at some point in the fu ture. For example, “I don’t want to end up having to pay a lot of money for a house.  So, I’m going to buy it right now before the prices go up.” In the dialogue, Olen a does not want to end up paying more for the equipment that she’s leasing th an she would if she bought the equipment. “To end up” here, then, means to be in a situation where in this case she had to pay more money for the equipment th an it’s worth, than you could buy it for.

She said she doesn’t want to do that “and still not  own the equipment at the end of the contract.” A “contract” is just a legal, usu ally written, agreement between two people or two companies. Remember, when you lea se something, you have to give it back to the person from whom you were le asing it, and Olena is worried

that they’ll be paying more for the piece of equipm ent that they’re leasing than it’s worth. They could just buy it rather than lease it.

But Joel says, “The flip side is that you won’t be saddled with outdated equipment that’s hard to off-load.” “The flip side”  is the other side of something, the other aspect of something. Literally, we talk a bout the flip side of a coin – a small piece of metal money. “To flip a coin” means to put it on your fingers and use your thumb, typically, to make it go around in circles. “The flip side of something” is the other side of something. Joel is saying that the other side of this situation – the situation of leasing – is that  you won’t be saddled with outdated equipment. “To be saddled (saddled) with s omething” means to have to do something that is difficult. We might also use t he expression “to be burdened with something.”

Joel is saying that you won’t have this problem, an d the problem you won’t have is having outdated equipment. Something that is “ou tdated” is something that is very old, something that is no longer used. If you have an old RadioShack TRS80 computer, that is very outdated. That was my first computer back many, many years ago. Joel says, “You won’t be saddled wi th outdated equipment that’s hard to off-load.” “To off-load” means to ge t rid of something that you no longer want.

Joel says, “My brother says that there are other ad vantages” – other positive things – “to leasing. You can have the maintenance included in your contract, so you won’t have to worry about high repair bills.” “ Maintenance” refers to taking care of a piece of equipment so that it continues t o work properly.

Olena says, “I don’t know.” Joel says, “And my brot her also told me that he was able to negotiate a purchase option.” A “purchase o ption” is when you lease something, but if you decide to buy it, the owner w ill use some of the money you pay to lease it as part of the purchase price – as part of what he’ll accept as payment for the item. So, if you “lease to own,” wh ich is the common expression in this situation, you are paying money now to use it, and then if you decide to buy it, to purchase it, you have that option. You h ave that choice in the future. Joel is telling Olena that she will have that choic e if she wants to, in the future. He says, “You can do the same” – the same thing – “ if you really want to own the equipment.”

Olena says, “Your brother really seems to know what  he’s talking about. Why isn’t he working for me?” Joel says, “You have some one even better. You have an employee who listens and steals the competitors’  good ideas.” Olena is sort of

joking here. She’s saying, “Well, why hasn’t your b rother worked for me, if he’s so smart.”

And Joel says, “Well, you have something better her e. You have someone” – meaning Joel – “who listens and ‘steals’” – or take s – “the competitiors’ good ideas.” Your “competitor” (competitor) is a busines s that sells the same kind of thing that you sell. A “competitor” can also be som eone with whom you are playing a game and you’re trying to defeat. You’re trying to win over the other person. You’re trying to win the game instead of th em. That’s also your competitor. What Joel is really saying, then, is th at Olena doesn’t have to have Joel’s brother working for her because Joel is goin g to take all of his brother’s good ideas and give them to Olena anyway.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
