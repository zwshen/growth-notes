This episode is called “Types of Guns and Weapons,” somewh at of an unusual topic for us.  It’s going to be a dialogue between Bo bbie, who is a woman in this dialogue, and Emmanuel.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bobbie:  I’ve always pegged you as the non-violent type.  What’s with your fascination with guns and that sort of thing?

Emmanuel:  I come from a long line of military office rs and I grew up with all of it. Believe it or not, I learned how to fire pistols and r ifles before I was 10 years old, and by the time I was 14, I was a pretty good shot.

Bobbie:  I hope you fired at targets and not at peopl e.

Emmanuel:  No, not people.  We did do some hunting when I was young, but I mainly honed my skills with target practice.

Bobbie:  I’d like to try target practice – with a machin e gun or a grenade launcher! I’m sure I’d at least hit something.

Emmanuel:  Yeah, right.  What really interests me are  the big weapons, like missiles – you know, like antiballistic missiles and torpedoes.

Bobbie:  You can have all of the missiles you want.  I’l l be hiding in the tank!

 Bobbie begins by saying to Emmanuel, “I’ve always pegged you as a non-violent type.”  “To peg (peg) (someone) as (something)” means to  believe that that person has certain characteristics or will behave in a certai n way.  For example, you might say, “I’ve always pegged you as a good swimmer,” meaning I’ve always thought that you were or believed that you were a  good swimmer.  You could also say, “I always pegged him as a great decision-make r,” someone who could make good decisions.  Bobbie says that she’s always pegge d Emmanuel as the non-violent type.  “Non-violent” means you don’t b elieve that people should hurt each other, usually that means you’re not int erested in things like guns and weapons.  A “weapon” is merely anything you use to hurt someone or to protect yourself, so a knife could be a weapon for example.  A gun is a weapon.

Bobbie then says, “What’s with your fascination with guns and that sort of thing?” “What’s with” is a construction we use to mean tell me mo re about, or why do you do that, I don’t understand why you are acting this wa y.  Someone may be feeling sad and they may be crying, and you may say, “What’s with the crying? What’s wrong?”  There’s something of a challenge ther e, too, when we use this expression sometimes: “What’s with your bad attitude?”  I t’s almost like you’re puzzled – you’re surprised, and perhaps you’re a little cri tical, though not always.

So, Bobbie says, “What’s with your fascination (your extreme  interest) with guns and that sort of thing?”  “That sort of thing” mean s related things.  Emmanuel says, “I come from a long line of military officers.”  He’ s trying to explain why he’s interested in guns.  He says, “I come from a long line of  military officers.”  The expression “to come from a long line of (something)” mea ns that you had relatives (your father, your grandfather, your great-gra ndfather, your great-great- grandfather) or other people who came before you in yo ur family who were interested in some particular area or who had a certai n job.  For example, I come from a long line of plumbers.  My grandfather was a pl umber, my great- grandfather was a plumber, my great-great-grandfather  was a plumber, my uncles were all plumbers.  My father was the only one – the only male in his family that wasn’t a plumber, but I could say I come fr om a long line of plumbers. I could say that – I don’t actually say that, especially to m y wife, because then she wants me to fix the sink!

Emmanuel, however, comes from a long line of “militar y officers,” people in the army, the navy – soldiers.  An “officer” is someone who is in charge soldiers; so a lieutenant, a sergeant, a captain, a general, these wo uld all be military officers. Emmanuel says, “I grew up with all of it,” meaning it was something I saw as a young child.  He says, “Believe it or not,” an expression we  use when we’re about to say something that the person might not believe, somet hing surprising,

 “Believe they’re not,” he says, “I learned how to fire p istols and rifles before I was 10 years old.”  “To fire a gun” means to make the gun shoot, to pull what we call the “trigger,” moving your finger so that the bullet w ill leave the gun.  That’s to fire a gun.  This particular gun is a pistol.  A “pistol” is a  small gun that you can hold in your hand.  Someone who is robbing a bank (who is tr ying to steal money from a bank) might have a pistol.  A “rifle” is a large, lon g gun, usually used for hunting.  It can also be used in a war, however.

So, Emmanuel learned how to fire – how to use pistol s and rifles even before he was 10 years old, “and by the time I was 14, I was a pre tty good shot.”  “To be a good shot” means that you can use a gun or a rifle very we ll.  You can, for example, hit a bird flying up in the air with just one  bullet – one shot.  That would be a good shot.  In the police and in the military for ces they train soldiers to use guns.  If you are very good at what you do, if you’re an  excellent what we would call “marksman” or “markswoman,” then they would call you a “sniper” (sniper) or a “sharpshooter.”  These are both terms used to describe someone who is an excellent shot, not just a good shot, a very good shot.

Bobbie says, “I hope you fired at targets and not at peo ple.”  When we talk about shooting guns, a “target” is an object or a thing that you try to hit with the bullet of your gun.  You can go, for example, to special places whe re they have targets that are small circles; we would call them “concentric” circl es, one circle inside of a larger circle, inside of a larger circle, and you try to  hit the middle of this circle. That would be a target.  She is saying here that she ho pes that Emmanuel was firing at (was shooting at) targets and not at people.

Emmanuel says, “No, not people.  We did do some hunting  when I was young.” Notice here, he could of just said “we hunted when I w as young,” but to express the past tense he instead uses “we did do some hunting.”   This is to emphasize, usually in a case where you are making a distinction so tha t the other person understands well, no, I didn’t do this, but I did do t his.  “Hunting” is when you go out and try to kill animals.  Hunting is legal in many st ates; it’s only legal, usually, for a certain number of weeks and during a certain tim e of year.  The fall is a very common time when there is hunting season.  This is especial ly popular in states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin, where it is legal during ce rtain times of the year to go and hunt deer and hunt certain kinds of bird s.  I know people who have done this; they own guns and they get a license to go  and hunt.  You need to get a license – you need to get permission from the g overnment.

Emmanuel says, “We did do some hunting when I was young, but I mainly (meaning I mostly) honed my skills with target practice.”  “To hone (hone) your skills” means to improve your ability to do something, to g et better at something.

 You might say, “I’m going to hone my typing skills.”  I’m  going to sit at my keyboard and improve my typing.  That would be to hone yo ur skills, to make them better.  Emmanuel says that he honed his skills with a gun by doing target practice.  “Target practice” is shooting at targets we tal ked about before.  There are places where you can go that are called “shooting ranges,” and you can go and practice shooting at these targets.  There are clubs – gun clubs that you can join that have these special buildings that have target  practice shooting ranges.

Bobbie says, “I’d like to try target practice – with a ma chine gun or a grenade launcher!”  A “machine gun” is a large gun that fires m any bullets automatically and very quickly.  It’s the sort of thing that you would use  in a war; it’s not the sort of thing you would normally use, for example, with the  police.  Although, if you remember the 1920s and 30s in the United States, and e ver saw any of the movies about the “gangsters,” people who were profession al criminals, sometimes in the movies you see them with machine guns.  O f course, sometimes you saw them in real life with machine guns!  That is a criminal use of machine guns.  But, the idea here is that Bobbie woul d have to use a machine gun because, she says, “I’m sure I’d at least hit somethin g,” meaning she’s not a very good shot, so she would need something like a machine  gun in order to hit something – in order to have the bullet go through som ething.  A “grenade” is a small, hand-held bomb that is usually used by soldiers in a war.  A “grenade launcher” is a machine that throws these bombs a long dist ance.

Emmanuel says, “Yeah, right.  What really interests me are the big weapons, like missiles – you know, like antiballistic missiles and torpedoes. ”  We’ve already talked about what weapons are, anything you use to hurt someone else or something else.  A “missile” is a bomb that is sent throug h the air at a long distance.  Sometimes it is dropped by a plane, sometimes it is “launched,” it is shot from the ground.  An “antiballistic missile” is a bo mb that is made to hit other bombs that are in the air, so it’s sort of a missile to stop another missile.  A “torpedo” is a missile that shot by a “submarine,” a ship  that is underneath the water.

Bobbie says, “You can have all the missiles you want.  I’l l be hiding in the tank!” A “tank” (tank) is a very large, heavy vehicle.  It’s like a b ig truck that is used by the army, and it has a large gun on the top of it for fighting.  “Tank,” like the word “fire” we used earlier, has a couple of different mea nings in English, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explan ations.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.
