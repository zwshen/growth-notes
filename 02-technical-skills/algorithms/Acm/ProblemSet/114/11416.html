<body><h1><center>Problem F : Excel Evaluation</center></h1><br>
<h3>Time Limit : 1 second</h3><br>
<div align="justify">
Spreadsheet applications are becoming more popular now a days. You are given the module of evaluation in the ongoing project.<br>

The spreadsheet looks as shown in figure above. The rows are numbered from 1 to 1000 and columns are represented as A, B, .... Z, AA, AB,  ... ..  AAA …, up to ZZZ. Each cell is denoted as A1, A2.. B1, B2... Etc.<br>
Max Row size = 1000<br>
max coloumn size = A to ZZZ<br>
Your job is to evaluate the cell that contains expression.<br>
The cells may contain either a numeric constant or an expression that begin with ‘e’.<br>
The expression is an ordinary arithmetic expression with cell references (A1, B1 etc) as operands. All operations are integer arithmetic.
You can safely assume that there are no cyclic dependencies.<br>
