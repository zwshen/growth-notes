[start of dialogue]

Kay:  I’d say we’re well on our way to establishing  our new online store.

Greg:  I can’t wait for this to get off the ground.  Orders will pour in and we’ll make money hand over fist.

Kay:  Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s see w here we are in our preparations.

Greg:  All right. We’ve created a marketing plan th at includes several ways to drive traffic to our website.

Kay:  That’s great. We’ve also installed a shopping  cart and a secure way to process orders.

Greg:  We can use that system to track orders, righ t?

Kay:  That’s right. All customer information will b e captured and we’ll have a database of information we can mine later.

Greg:  That’s great. We already have a place to hou se the inventory and a way to track it.

Kay:  Right you are. Now all we need is one last th ing.

Greg:  We need to find a product to sell.

Kay:  Yeah. Any ideas?

Greg:  No, none. You?

Kay:  Nope. But as soon as we do, we’ll be the next  big thing in ecommerce.

Greg:  Definitely!

Kate starts by saying, “I’d say” – “I would say,” m eaning here, “I think” – “we’re well on our way to establishing our new online stor e.” “We’re well on our way” means we are well on our way and that means that we  are making good progress toward something. We’re getting closer to our goal, to finishing – in this case, this new project of establishing or starting an online store, a website basically on the Internet where you sell things. Gr eg says, “I can’t wait for this to get off the ground.” When someone says, “I can’t wa it for something” they mean they’re very excited about it. Greg can’t wait for this online store to “get off the ground” (ground). “To get something off the ground”  means to begin something – usually a project – to start something for the firs t time. Greg says, “orders” – people buying things – “orders will pour in and we’ ll make money hand over fist.” The expression “to pour (pour) in” means to receive  a lot of something, especially money, but it could be letters or emails. We could say, “The money is pouring in from our new product” – our new thing that we are s elling on the Internet. Greg thinks money will pour in and that they will “make money hand over fist” (fist). The expression “to make money hand over fist” means  to make a lot of money, to get very rich by doing something. Someone’s making money hand over fist.

Kay says, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.” The e xpression “to get ahead of yourself,” or “to get ahead of ourselves,” means to  get so excited about something that we begin to think about all the wond erful things that will happen in the future and not focus on preparing for what’s ha ppening right now. “To get ahead of yourself” would mean to start making plans , for example, about how you’re going to spend your money that you are going  to get from your new online website – online store, rather – before you’ve actu ally started the business. That’s getting ahead of yourself. Or you see a beau tiful woman and you start thinking about how you’re going to marry her and ha ve children and you don’t even have her telephone number yet. Kay says, “Let’ s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s see where we are in our preparatio ns.” “Let’s see where we are,” meaning let’s look at where we are currently – what  we are doing now – for our preparations.

 Greg says, “All right. We’ve created a marketing pl an that includes several ways to drive traffic to our website.” A “marketing plan ” is a plan about how you’re going to go out and find customers and get them to buy your product. “Driving traffic” means encouraging people to visit your web site or to go to your store. On the Internet, it means to get people – we call them  “visitors” – to come to your website and look at it and hopefully buy something from it. Kay says, “That’s great. We’ve also installed a shopping cart and a s ecure way to process orders.” “To install (install)” means to connect or to put s omething in somewhere. It could be something physical like, for example, I need a n ew water heater in my house so I ask a plumber – a person who deals with things  like water heaters – to come in and install it in my house, to connect it, to pu t it in. We also use this verb in talking about computer programs, computer software,  which are installed on a computer or on a computer that is running a website .

In this case, the software that is installed was a “shopping cart.” On a website, a “shopping cart” is a piece of software that allows you to look at things that are being sold and to buy them. It’s sort of a part of the website that you actually use to buy something. If you go to a real physical stor e like a grocery store, where you buy food, you also have a shopping cart. It’s t hat thing that you push around that you put the food into so you don’t have to car ry it in your hands. On a website, however, a shopping cart is the part of the website used to buy things.

Kay says they have “installed a shopping cart and a  secure way to process orders.” “Secure” (secure) means safe. And on the I nternet, it means a place where your information, your name, your credit card , your address, will be safe – it won’t get stolen, someone won’t come and take it  and use it somewhere else. Kay says they have a secure way “to process orders. ” “To process (process) orders” means that you receive orders that people g ive you, that is, things that they want to buy – that’s what an order is. You say , “I want to buy this.” “To process” them means to take care of them, to figure  out who’s going to get what and so forth. In an online store, sometimes you are  buying things that the company will send you in the mail. Sometimes, you’r e simply buying things that you download onto your computer.

Greg says, “We can use that system to track orders,  right?” “To track (track) orders” means to make sure you know what’s going on  with the order at all times – whether it was paid for, whether it was shipped –  that is, whether it was sent to the person who bought. In some cases, whether the p erson received it – all of that would be part of “tracking an order.” “Process ing the order” means getting it ready to send; “tracking the order” means knowing w hat part of the process you are in.

 Kay says, “That’s right. All customer information w ill be captured and we’ll have a database of information we can mine later.” “To cap ture” (capture) here means to record, to save that information from the customer.  “Capture” has a number of different meanings in English. Take a look at our L earning Guide for some of those. Kay says they also have a “database” (databa se). A “database” is a computer program that saves and organizes informati on for you. “To mine” (mine) here – when we’re talking about websites and  databases – means to analyze a large amount of information, a large amou nt of data to find interesting patterns. So, you might want to know whether people  from this country are buying more on a weekend than people from that coun try. You can look at your database – your set of information – and “mine” it.  You could go in and try to find information by using other computer software.

Greg says, “That’s great. We already have a place t o house the inventory and a way to track it.” “To house (house) something” mean s to store it, to keep it until you are ready to use it. So, if you’re selling book s on your website, you would need a place to house the physical books. You need a place to keep them. The “inventory” (inventory) refers to all of the things  that you are selling – usually physical things. So, your inventory would be all of  the books that you have that you are selling on your website or all of the compu ters you have that you are selling on your website.

Kay says, “Right you are,” meaning that’s correct. “Now all we need is one last thing” – one final thing. Greg says, “We need to fi nd a product to sell.” Of course, normally when you have a store you know what you’re  going to sell but Greg and Kay have built a website but they don’t have anythi ng to sell yet. Kay says, “Yeah, any ideas?” Greg says, “No, none. You?” mean ing “Do you?” Kay says, “Nope” – an informal way of saying no. “But as soon  as we do, we’ll be the next big thing in ecommerce.” “The next big thing” is the most recent thing to become popular that everyone is talking about. So, a few y ears ago it was Facebook and then it was Twitter and then it was – I don’t know,  Pinterest. Whatever the next most popular thing is that’s “the next big thing.” “Ecommerce” (ecommerce) refers to selling things on the Internet – Internet  selling and buying.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
