This episode is called “Having a Business Mentor.”  A “men tor” is a person who gives you advice.  It’s a conversation between Alex and Kenya.   Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alex:  Where are you going?

Kenya:  I’m going to meet my business mentor.

Alex:  Your business mentor?  What do you do with a busin ess mentor?

Kenya:  Well, my mentor is like an advisor.  We meet reg ularly and I get her feedback and guidance with my ideas on starting a business.

Alex:  Oh, so you’re her protégé?

Kenya:  No, I’m not.  I simply go to her with my ideas a nd she helps me hash them out.  She’s a successful entrepreneur and I’m there  to learn from her experience.

Alex:  How did you get her to be your mentor?  Were yo u already friends?

Kenya:  No, I contacted her out of the blue, actually.  I’ve read about her company and her many successes, and I wrote her a letter te lling her about me and what I hope to accomplish.  She agreed to meet wit h me, and at that first meeting, we really clicked and now we meet once a month.

Alex:  That’s very generous of her.  What does she get out  of it?

 Kenya:  I’m not sure, but I think she enjoys giving me po inters and sharing her expertise.  I’m very appreciative and she says I remind her  a lot of herself when she was my age.  I take that as a huge compliment.

Alex:  You should.  If you’re like her, you’ll be a mult i-millionaire in no time flat.

Our dialogue begins with Alex saying to Kenya, “Where a re you going?”  Kenya responds, “I’m going to meet my business mentor.”  A “men tor,” or “mentor,” (mentor) is a person who provides advice, help to someone for free, usually someone who is either much younger or someone who is less  experienced in a particular area.  So if you decided to become a lawyer –  and I hope you don’t – then you may find an older lawyer, or a lawyer with mor e experience to be your mentor, to help you, to give you advice, and so forth.

Kenya says, “I’m going to meet my business mentor,” so obviou sly this has to do with helping her in her business.  Alex says, “Your business mentor?  What do you do with a business mentor?”  Kenya says, “Well, my mento r is like an advisor.”  An “advisor” (advisor) is someone who also provide s advice to another person, who helps someone make a decision.  A mentor is one kind of advisor. Kenya says that she and her business mentor meet “regularl y,” meaning on a schedule, perhaps at the same time and the same day each  week or each month.  She says, “I get her feedback and guidance with m y ideas on starting a business.”  “Feedback” (feedback) is your opinion about how  something is doing, whether something is working well, whether it is a good  idea.  The verb we use is typically “give” – “to give feedback.”  We appreciate your f eedback on our podcast – your opinions, your advice, and so forth.  Well,  Kenya gets feedback from her mentor.  She also gets guidance (guidance).  “ Guidance” is another word for advice, assistance, help on how to do something co rrectly; in this case, how to start a new business.

Alex says, “Oh, so you’re her protégé?”  “Protégé” (prot égé) is a word that we borrowed from the French.  In English, it means a pers on who receives advice, help, guidance, perhaps even money from someone who is ol der or more experienced.  So, the protégé is the person who is receivi ng – who is getting the advice.

Kenya responds, “No, I’m not.  I simply go to her with m y ideas and she helps me hash them out.”  To “hash (hash) (something) out” or  to “hash out (something)” is

 a two-word phrasal verb meaning to discuss something in g reat detail, to look at every possible piece of information about something, to spend a long time discussing it.  Often we use this expression when two people  have different views – if they have a disagreement about something, and  they’re trying to come to an agreement.  Kenya says that she’s not her business men tor’s protégé, but I think she really is.  Perhaps she just doesn’t like that wo rd, I’m not sure why. You will have to ask Kenya!

Kenya says that her business mentor is a successful entrepreneu r “and I’m there to learn from her experience.”  “Entrepreneur” is anot her word from the French. In English it means someone who takes risks and starts a new  business, usually a small-business owner.  Someone who decides to start thei r own business is an entrepreneur (entrepreneur).

Alex then asks, “How did you get her to be your mentor?  Were you already friends?”  Kenya replies, “No, I contacted her out of the blue, actually.”  Kenya contacted – made contact with her by calling or emailing or sending a bird with a message or throwing a bottle into the water with a me ssage.  All of these are ways to contact people.  You can contact us here in Los An geles.  If you live near an ocean, just put your note into a bottle and throw the bottle into the ocean and eventually we’ll get it – or email!

Where were we?  Kenya – yes.  Kenya had contacted her me ntor out of the blue. The expression “out of the blue,” like the color blue, m eans unexpectedly, something you weren’t expecting, or something you do wi thout planning, without any previous connection to the person.  In this case, it is really the last meaning: without any previous or prior relationship.  “Somebody ca lled me out of the blue and asked me to teach their daughter English.”  I did n ot know this person; they contacted me and I wasn’t expecting it.  Well, Kenya cont acted her mentor out of the blue.  She read about her company and her many succe sses, the things that she was successful at, and so Kenya wrote her a letter telli ng her about herself and what she hopes to accomplish.  To “accomplish” means to do something successfully, especially something that is difficult or unusual.   The noun is “accomplishment.”  Running down the street isn’t an accomp lishment, but running a marathon is.  A marathon is a long race.  So , it has to be something difficult.  The mentor has many accomplishments.  She agr eed to meet with Kenya, and at their first meeting, she says, “we really cl icked.”  When we say that we “click with” someone, or simply “we clicked,” it means tha t we had a good relationship almost immediately with the other person, that we enjoy talking to each other, that it didn’t take long for us to become co mfortable with each other.

 The word “click” (click) has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more information.

Now Kenya says she and her mentor meet once a month.  Ale x says, “That’s very generous of her (that’s very nice of her).  What does she get out of it?”  The expression “to get (something) out of (something else)” m eans to receive some benefit from your action or your participation in someth ing, that you get something too.  So if you help, for example, teach a yo ung child to read, the child learns to read and what you get out of it is the joy, t he satisfaction of knowing that you helped that young child do something.

Alex wants to know what the mentor gets out of this rela tionship with Kenya. Kenya says, “I’m not sure, but I think she enjoys giving me pointers and sharing her expertise.”  A “pointer” (pointer) here means a pi ece of advice, a recommendation, we might say a “tip” (tip).  That’s a p ointer.  There are some additional meanings in the Learning Guide on this wor d as well.  “Expertise” (expertise) – notice that it is spelled with an “i” at t he end, “ise,” but is pronounced like it were an “e,” “expertise.”  Well, “exp ertise” is special knowledge about a certain subject, a certain what we may call fie ld – area of study or interest.  A person who has expertise is called an “expert. ”  Kenya says that she’s very appreciative; she’s appreciative of her mentor.  “ Appreciative” means that you feel thankful, you feel grateful for somethin g that another person has done for you.  We should all be more appreciative of o ur families, our houses, our jobs, and so forth.  There’s always things to be appr eciative for in our world.

Kenya is appreciative of her mentor.  Her mentor says that  Kenya reminds her a lot of herself when she was my age.  “She reminds her  of herself,” meaning she sees something about her own experience in Kenya.  “I t ake that as a huge compliment,” Kenya says.  A “compliment” (compliment) mea ns nice words about someone showing that you respect them, you appreciate the m, you admire them. That’s a compliment.  There’s another word pronounced t he same, “complement,” except there’s an “e” in the middle of the word, that means something very different.  “Complement” with an “e” i s something that goes along with or matches or completes something else.  A “complimen t” with an “i” is a nice thing you say about someone.  If your husband or wife  cooks you a good meal you should compliment them.  In fact, even if it i sn’t good you should compliment them!

Well, Kenya takes the fact that this woman sees herself in Kenya as a huge, or big, compliment.  Alex says, “You should (you should take it  as a compliment).  If you’re like her,” Alex says, “you’ll be a multi-millionair e in no time flat.”  “Multi- (or

 multi-)” (multi-) is a prefix (something that goes in f ront of the word) that means many or more than one.  So, a “multi-millionaire” is someone who makes more than a million dollars – 2 million, 3 million, 10 mi llion dollars a year, let’s say.  The expression “in no time flat” (flat) means very quickly, very soon, in the very near future.  Alex means that if Kenya is like her mentor she will soon be a multi- millionaire.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
