<P>
The fastfood chain McBurger owns several restaurants along a highway. Recently, they have decided
to build several depots along the highway, each one located at a restaurent and supplying several of the
restaurants with the needed ingredients. Naturally, these depots should be placed so that the average
distance between a restaurant and its assigned depot is minimized. You are to write a program that
computes the optimal positions and assignments of the depots.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
To make this more precise, the management of McBurger has issued the following specification:
You will be given the positions of <I>n</I> restaurants along the highway as <I>n</I>
integers

(these are the distances measured from the
company's headquarter, which happens to be at the same highway). Furthermore,
a number

will be given, the number of depots to be built.

<P>
The <I>k</I> depots will be built at the locations of <I>k</I> different restaurants.
Each restaurant will be assigned to the closest depot, from which it will then
receive its supplies. To minimize shipping costs, the <EM>total distance sum</EM>,

The input file contains several descriptions of fastfood chains. Each description starts with a line
containing the two integers <I>n</I> and <I>k</I>. <I>n</I> and <I>k</I> will satisfy

The input file will end with a case starting with <I>n</I> = <I>k</I> = 0. This case

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For each chain, first output the number of the chain. Then output an optimal placement of the depots
as follows: for each depot output a line containing its position and the range of restaurants it serves.
If there is more than one optimal solution, output any of them. After the depot descriptions output a
line containing the total distance sum, as defined in the problem text.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Output a blank line after each test case.
