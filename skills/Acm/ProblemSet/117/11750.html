<h2>Problem I: Red-Blue Tree</h2>

<font color="white"><img src="p11750.jpg" width="400" align="right" border="5"></font>
<p>Given a rooted tree T and a set S of pairs of vertices from T, we
say that T is a red-blue tree on S if it is possible to colour every
vertex in the tree with either red or blue such that the following
holds:
</p>
<p>For each pair of vertices (a,b) in S, consider the unique path in T
connecting a to b. Any two vertices on this path that share a common
parent in T
must be coloured with different colours.
</p>
<p>Given a rooted tree T, a set of vertex pairs S, and the fact that T
is a red-blue tree on S, you are to find the maximum number of pairs
from S that can be simultaneously connected in T using each tree edge
at most once.
</p>
<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>Each test case starts with three integers 1 ≤ <em>n</em> ≤ 100, 0 ≤ <em>k</em> ≤ 3000 and 1 ≤ r ≤ n which are the number of vertices, number of pairs and index of the root, respectively. Next <em>n</em> -1 lines contain two integers between 1 and <em>n</em> describing two endpoints of an edge. Next <em>k</em> lines contain two integers between 1 and <em>n</em> giving a pair of vertices. Input is terminated with a line consisting of <em>n</em> = <em>k</em> = <em>r</em> = 0. You are guaranteed each input graph is a connected
tree rooted at the given <em>r</em> and is a red-blue tree on the given pairs.
</p>
<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p>There is a line of output for each test case containing the maximum
number of pairs from the given list that can be simultaneously
connected using each tree edge at most once.
