In this episode, we're going to see Lucy clean up a round the house and then relax. Let's get started. 

[Start of story] 

I am feeling pretty energetic when I finish my thre e cookies and decide to do a little cleaning.  I take out a rag and start dustin g the living room.  I dust the TV and the lamps.  I wipe the coffee table, too.  The rug looked filthy so I get out the vacuum and vacuum it.  I pick up around the room an d put things away.  The bathroom needs cleaning, too, but by this time, I a m starting to feel tired. Mopping the bathroom floor and scrubbing the tub wi ll have to wait for another day. 

I turn on the TV to watch the newscast, but I misse d the national news.  I flip though the channels but all I see are commercials.  My favorite reality show doesn’t come on for another hour so I turn off the TV.  I put down the remote, and pick up a magazine.  I thumb through it for few min utes and then the phone rings. It’s my best friend Marlene, so I put down the maga zine and spend the half hour chatting with her.  There’s nothing like a good tal k with a good friend to end a busy day.

Lucy starts by saying that she's "feeling pretty en ergetic," or very energetic. Energetic, "energetic," comes from the word energy,  "energy."  Energy is the same as power.  When we say someone is energetic, u sually we mean that they have a lot of willingness to do something - they ha ve a lot of energy.  We also use that expression, she has a lot of energy; that means she has a lot of strength to do things - she doesn't get tired very easily.  It's the opposite of being tired.  It's to be energetic, like the host of ESLPod.com's cour ses, very energetic!

"When I finish my three cookies," Lucy says, that i s, when I finish eating my three cookies, I "decide to do a little cleaning," she sa ys.  So, Lucy takes "out a rag" and starts "dusting the living room."  A rag, "rag, " or a rag, depends on what part of the country you are from, in my part of the coun try, we say rag, "I take out a rag and start dusting the living room."  A rag is a  small towel; usually it's a small towel you use for cleaning.  To dust, "dust," means  to take a rag or a small towel and remove the little bits of dirt, what we call du st, off of a table or television or other furniture.  Dust can be both a noun as well a s a verb.  As a noun, it's the little dirt - pieces of dirt.  As a verb, it means to remove those pieces of dirt. 

Lucy says that she dusts "the TV and the lamps."  S he wipes "the coffee table, too."  To wipe, "wipe," is similar to dust.  It mea ns taking a rag or a towel and cleaning something up.  The difference is that dust ing is only used when we are talking about these little pieces of dirt that you find after a few days in your house.  When you say I'm going to wipe something, h owever, usually that means there's some water or some other dirt - something b igger than just little pieces of dust.  So Lucy says she will "wipe the coffee table " also. 

"The rug" that Lucy has looks "filthy."  Filthy, "f ilthy," is another word for dirty.  So, the rug on the floor looks dirty, so she gets "out the vacuum" and vacuums it. The vacuum, "vacuum," is a machine that removes dir t from the floor - from carpet or rugs - by sucking the dirt out.  Vacuum c an also be a verb, so when you say, "I'm going to vacuum my rugs," you mean you're  going to use a vacuum to clean your rugs. 

Lucy picks "up around the room and puts things away ."  To pick up can mean to take with your hand and grab something and lift it,  but in this case, to pick up means that Lucy is going around and putting things where they belong - taking the newspaper out and throwing in away or making su re that the table looks nice, that it's been dusted.  This is to pick up - to tak e things that don't belong in the room and move them somewhere else.  When you move t hem somewhere else, we say that you are putting them away.  So, to put something away means to put it where it belongs.  Often, this means putting it in a closet or somewhere where you store it or keep it so that people can't see it .  So, Lucy picks "up around the room and puts things" that don't belong there - tha t should not be there - "away." 

"The bathroom needs cleaning" as well, Lucy says.  Lucy sure does have a dirty apartment!  "The bathroom needs cleaning" also, "bu t by this time," she says, "I'm starting to feel tired.  Mopping the bathroom floor and scrubbing the tub will have to wait for another day."  Mopping comes from the verb to mop, "mop."  A mop is both a noun and a verb.  As a noun, it is th e thing you use to clean floors

with water and soap.  It looks a little like a broo m.  A broom, "broom," is what you use to clean dust and dirt off the floor.  A mop is  what you use with water to clean a floor.  So, the floor would not have a carpet or not have a rug on it, it would just be wood or linoleum or some other material. 

Well, in the story Lucy says that she needs to mop her bathroom and to scrub her tub.  Scrub, "scrub" is a verb, which means to clean something by using a lot of energy - by using a lot of force.  Taking a towe l, for example, and rubbing it back and forth several times; that would be to scru b something.  Lucy says that she's too tired, so that the mopping and the scrubb ing "will have to wait for another day."  Or, if this were my house, it would be another year! 

Lucy turns on the television "to watch the newscast ."  A newscast, "newscast," is the same as a news program or a television news sho w that you will watch usually either on your television, although you cou ld have a newscast on the radio as well, or on a podcast. 

Lucy says that she was too late to watch the nation al news; she "missed the national news."  The national news, of course, woul d be news about the whole country, not just about your particular area.  If i t is news just about your city, we would call that local news. 

Lucy flips "through the channels but all" she sees "are commercials."  The channels, "channels," are the stations on the telev ision.  If you have a cable television, you may have 100, 150, 200 channels - 2 00 different television stations you can watch.  In this case, Lucy is flip ping through the channels.  To flip, "flip," through the channels means to go from  one channel to another, usually somewhat quickly.  You want to see what programs ar e on the television right now, so you flip through the channels.  Unfortunate ly, all Lucy sees "are commercials."  Commercials are just advertisements.   These are things that you see on television that try to get you, usually, to buy something. 

"My favorite reality show," Lucy says, "doesn’t com e on for another hour."  A reality, "reality," show, "show," is a television p rogram that does not have professional actors or actresses; it is a show wher e there is a contest between people or groups of people.  Lucy says her show "do esn't come on," or isn't going to be on the television, "for another hour" s o she turns the television off.   

She puts "down the remote."  The remote, "remote," is the same as the remote control, and that's the little thing you use to cha nge channels - to flip through the channels, means the same thing, to change channels - to flip through.  It's also  

ESL Podcast 39 - Cleaning and Relaxing 

what you use to increase the volume - make it loude r - or decrease the volume - make it quieter.  This is called a remote control.  Sometimes we just call it a remote.  In my house, for example, if I'm watching television, I have to have the remote control.  If my wife has the remote, it driv es me crazy! 

Back to Lucy, Lucy says that she picks "up a magazi ne" and she thumbs "through it."  To thumb through, "thumb" through (t wo words) means to look at a magazine or a newspaper, but you're not looking at it very closely.  It's sort of like flipping through the channels.  You're flipping thr ough, or thumbing through, the magazine to see what stories are in it or what pict ures are in it.  That's what I do; I just look at the pictures. 

After a "few minutes," Lucy's "phone rings" and it' s her "best friend Marlene," and she says, "Well, come on Marlene, let's talk," and so she puts "down the magazine" and she spends a half an hour "chatting w ith her" friend.  To chat, "chat," means to talk to someone, usually about som ething that isn't very important.  She ends her story by saying, "There’s nothing like a good talk with a good friend to end a busy day."  There’s nothing li ke means that this is the best - the best possible thing.  The best possible thing i s a good talk - a good conversation - with a good friend.  There's nothing  like listening to ESL Podcast to improve your English.  There's nothing like it!  I hope you agree.  Even if you don't, we're going to listen to the story now at a native rate of speech.
