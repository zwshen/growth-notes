Visit ESLPod.com and take a look at our ESL Podcast  Store which has additional courses in Business and Daily English. In this epis ode, we’re going to listen to a dialogue between Thomas and Celeste about designing  things to sell. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Thomas: What do you think of my creations? 

Celeste: These are . . . interesting? 

Thomas: They’re part of my new product line to be s old under my own label. 

Celeste: Really? 

Thomas: Yeah, I’m jumping in with both feet. Everyb ody advised me to get my feet wet by licensing a collection, but I don’t wan t to sell under someone else’s brand. 

Celeste: I thought you started all this by doing cu stom work.  

Thomas: I did, but I’m ready to produce an entire l ine I’ve designed according to my vision, not work to a client’s specs. 

Celeste: I can understand that. Will you be selling  to trade or retail customers? 

Thomas: Retail. I plan to have showrooms in every m ajor city. See? This is a sample of our product catalog.  

Celeste: I see. Your products look high-end, but th ey’re intended for the mass market. 

Thomas: That’s right. Do you want to take home a sa mple?  

 Celeste: Um, I guess so. I’d never considered using  anything like that. 

Thomas: Once you sit on a designer toilet seat, you ’ll never go back!

Thomas begins our dialogue by asking Celeste, “What  do you think of my creations?” Your “creations” (creations) are things  that you create – that is, things that you make. Celeste says, “These are . . . inter esting?” Notice she asks this almost as a question because she’s not really sure what to say about them. Sometimes when we don’t want to criticize someone w hen we don’t like something, we may use an expression like “Well that ’s . . . interesting.”  

Thomas says that his creations are part of his “new  product line” to be sold under his “own label.” A “product line” is a group of rel ated things or products that are sold by a certain company. They may be things that are all related to, I don’t know, haircare, or drinking coffee. A product line could include clothing that is related – a set of shirts or dresses might be part of a product line.  

We’re not sure what Thomas’s product line is but we  know that he’s going to sell it “under his own label” (label). “To be sold under ” means it will be sold with the name of a certain “label.” A “label” is a part of t he packaging of a product that indicates what company has made the product. It’s u sed here more generally to mean “brand” (brand). Your “brand” is the name that  you use for selling certain kinds of products, certain kinds of things.  

A big company may have several brands – several thi ngs that it sells under different names. For example, The Coca-Cola company  has different brands that it sells. One of the brands is, of course, Coca-Col a, but there are other brands, other kinds of things that it sells, other drinks t hat use different names. Brands such as Fanta or Minute Maid Orange Juice. They’re made by the same company but they are different brands. Thomas is go ing to be selling his product line or group of products under his own brand or la bel.  

Celeste is surprised by this. She says, “Really?” T homas replies, “Yeah,” meaning yes. “I’m jumping in with both feet,” he sa ys. The expression “to jump in with both feet” means to begin to do something comp letely and immediately, without waiting. If you’re “jumping in with both fe et,” you’re going to commit 100 percent of your energy to do whatever it is you’re doing. You’re not going to go slowly or only commit part of your energy and money . You’re going to do it fully and immediately.   

 Thomas says, “Everybody advised me to get my feet w et by licensing a collection, but I don’t want to sell under someone else’s brand.” The expression “to get your feet wet” is somewhat of the opposite of “to jump in with both feet.” “To get your feet wet” means to move slowly without  risking too much. You can think of going to a swimming pool. If you don’t wan t to get wet all right away, you might just put your feet in the water. You’re “gett ing your feet wet,” and then when you are ready, you’ll get the rest of your bod y wet – then perhaps you will jump in with both feet.  

Thomas says that people told him, “advised” him, to  get his feet wet “by licensing a collection.” “To license” (license) something is to give someone permission to sell what you have made, which often includes the r ight to make something and sell it to someone else. A collection is similar to  a product line. It’s a group of products. 

Some people told Thomas that he should license his collection – he should give his products to another person and have them make i t and sell it. He wouldn’t make as much money that way, of course, but it woul d be less risky. It would not involve him as much, and therefore if things didn’t  work out well, he wouldn’t lose a lot of money. However, Thomas says he doesn’t wan t “to sell under someone else’s brand.”  

Celeste says, “I thought you started all this by do ing custom work.” “Custom” (custom) means “customized,” or designed to meet on e particular client or customer’s needs. If you buy a suit from a store an d put it on, take it home and wear it, you’re not buying a “custom suit.” That su it, that jacket, and pair of pants wasn’t made for you. But if you go to someone who m akes suits and measures them to your particular body to make sure that it f its you perfectly, then you would be getting a “custom-made suit.” Thomas began worki ng by doing “custom work” for individual people.  

Thomas says, “I did,” meaning yes, I did do that. “ But I’m ready to produce an entire line” – a complete product line – “I’ve desi gned according to my vision, not work to a client’s specs.” Thomas has designed or c reated something with particular characteristics – an “entire product lin e.” He’s done this, he says, “according to his vision” (vision). Your “vision” i s your image of what something should look like, your creative inspiration.  

Thomas has designed this product line according to his vision, not according to his “client’s specs.” “Client” is another word for “customer” – someone who buys what you make or uses you for a certain service. Th e word “specs” (specs) refers  

to the requirements or detailed information for som ething. “Specs” is short for “specifications” – the particular details about how  something should be made or done. Celeste says, “I can understand that,” meanin g she can understand Thomas wanting to work according to his own vision.   

She says, “Will you be selling to trade or retail c ustomers?” “Trade (trade) customers” are other companies who will sell what y ou make. “Retail” (retail) are customers who buy directly from you. So if you make , say, coffee cups and you want to sell them, you could sell them to a store w hich would then sell them to individual people. That would be an example of a “t rade customer.” The store is your customer. A “retail customer” would be someone  who bought the cups directly from you – from your store, or perhaps now adays online. Thomas says he’s going to sell to retail customers.  

He explains, “I plan to have showrooms in every maj or city.” A “showroom” (showroom) is a large room or a building where peop le can come and see the things that you have made. You are showing them the  things you have made so they will then, of course, buy them. A “major city”  is a large city. Thomas says he’s going to have “showrooms in every major city.”  He continues, “See? This is a sample of our product catalog.” A “catalog” (cata log) – it can also be spelled (catalogue) – is basically a book that shows people  photographs of the things that you are selling.  

Celeste says, “I see. Your products look high-end.”  “High (high) – end (end)” means very expensive or of a very high quality. Cel este says that Thomas’s products look high-end in the photographs, “but the y’re intended for the mass market.” “Intended for” means they are meant to be sold to. The “mass (mass) market (market)” is the average consumer or the ave rage buyer. The “mass market” refers to perhaps the majority of people in  a certain area who might buy something. Normally, things that are intended for t he “mass market” are of a lower price and often of a lower quality.  

Thomas, however, says, “That’s right,” meaning yes,  my products look high-end – they have the appearance of being high-end – but they’re intended for the average person, the mass market. He asks if Celeste  wants to take home a sample of his product. Celeste says, “Um, I guess s o.” We use that expression “I guess so” when we’re not very sure of our answer. S he says, “I’d never considered using anything like that.” We’re not sur e exactly what Thomas is giving her, but Celeste says she had never consider ed using something like his product.  

Thomas then tells us what his product is. He says, “Once you sit on a designer toilet seat, you’ll never go back.” A “toilet seat”  (seat) is what you sit on in the bathroom to do what your normally do in a bathroom – use the toilet. A “designer toilet seat” would be a special toilet seat that is  made perhaps of a higher quality or has some sort of special look to it.  

Thomas says, “Once you sit on a designer toilet sea t, you’ll never go back.” That expression “you’ll never go back” means you will ne ver use a regular toilet seat again, in this example. “You’ll never go back” mean s, more generally, you’ll never use what you used to use before, because now you’ve  experienced this new wonderful thing.  

I’m not sure if I’d recommend buying a designer toi let seat, but I would recommend listening to our dialogue one more time, this time at a native rate of speech.
