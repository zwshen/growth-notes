[start of dialogue] 

Louise:  What’s the matter with you? 

Gil:  I just got off the phone with my mom and she says t hey’re planning a welcome-home party for me next week – at a restaurant! 

Louise:  What’s wrong with that? 

Gil:  After living abroad for a year, I was really loo king forward to a home-cooked meal. 

Louise:  Why didn’t you just tell your mother that? 

Gil:  I didn’t have the heart to do that.  She was so  excited about the party, and who am I to tell her she has to slave over a hot stove to cook me a lavish dinner?   

Louise:  I’m sure she wouldn’t mind.  It’d be a labo r of love. 

Gil:  You don’t know my mother.  She doesn’t cut corner s and makes everything from scratch.  She uses these recipes that were passed down to her from her mother.  She can make the most intricate dishes, but what  I’m craving are the comfort foods she always made for us when we were kids.  It  makes my mouth water just thinking about her cooking.  

 Louise:  After a year of living on instant noodles and t ake-out food, I’m not surprised you want something home-cooked.  I tell you what .  After the party, come over to my house and I’ll have a home-cooked meal ready for you. 

Gil:  You, cook for me?  Thanks, but no thanks!

Louise begins by saying to Gil, “What’s the matter with you?” meaning what is wrong with you.  Gil says, “I just got off the phone wit h my mom and she says they’re planning a welcome-home party for me next week –  at a restaurant!”  So, Gil says he just got off the phone, meaning he just fini shed talking to his mother, and his mother says that they (his family) is planning a w elcome-home party for him.  “Welcome home” is when someone goes away and then comes back home.  If they’ve been gone a long time you might have a welcome-home party. But this party is going to be at a restaurant.  Louise sa ys, “What’s wrong with that?”  Gil says, “After living abroad for a year, I w as really looking forward to a home-cooked meal.”  “To live abroad” means to live in a nother country; sometimes people say “to live overseas.”  That’s popular in  the United States, meaning you have to cross the ocean – cross the Atlantic o r Pacific and live in another place.  But that’s not always the case; you can live  abroad by moving to Canada for example. 

Gil says that he was really looking forward, after having been away from his country and his family for a year, to a “home-cooked meal ,” a meal – a lunch or a dinner – that is prepared at home.  Louise says, “Why d idn’t you just tell your mother that?”  Gil says, “I didn’t have the heart to do  that.”  If someone says they “don’t have the heart to do (something)” they mean t hey don’t want to say something or do something because they think it will hur t another person’s feelings – it will make that other person feel bad.  Gil says his mom “was so excited about the party, and who am I to tell her she h as to slave over a hot stove to cook me a lavish dinner?”  “Who am I to tell her (me ans how can I tell her; what right do I have to tell her) to slave over a hot stove?”  A “stove” (stove) is what you have in the kitchen; you use it to put pans on a nd then you light a fire underneath, or have some sort of heat coming from bel ow and you cook things inside of the pan.  “To slave (slave) over (something)” m eans to work very hard at something.  A “slave” is a person who is owned by anoth er person. Fortunately in the United States there is no more slaver y; we don’t have any slaves, at least not legally.  But the expression “to slave o ver” means to work  

 very hard at something, and this is a common way of using i t: “to slave over a hot stove.”   

He doesn’t want his mother to slave over a hot stove just co ok him a lavish dinner.  “Lavish” (lavish) is something that is very fancy; i t could be something very expensive.  We could talk about giving your wife a lavi sh Christmas gift or birthday gift.  “Lavish” would be expensive, it would be  nice, and I would highly recommend it!  But here, it means a meal that perhaps  had many different ingredients that was very difficult to make. 

Louise says, “I’m sure your mother wouldn’t mind,” meanin g it would not bother her.  “It would be,” she says, “a labor of love.”  The e xpression “a labor of love” means doing something difficult or that takes a lot of time, but you do it because you love the other person.  You want to show the other  person how much you love them by doing this particular thing.  So it’s diffi cult, yes, but you’re doing it because you love this person. 

Gil says, “You don’t know my mother.  She doesn’t cut corne rs and makes everything from scratch.”  “To cut corners” is an expression th at means to do something the easy way.  “To take shortcuts” is another exp ression that means the same thing.  If you cut corners, usually the final re sult is not as good as it could have been.  You are not doing everything you’re sup posed to do.  Well, his mother does not cut corners; she makes everything from scratch .  To cook or to make some particular food “from scratch” (scratch) means tha t you don’t use any canned good, you don’t use any food that has already be en prepared; you just start with the basic ingredients and you mix them togeth er and you cook them or prepare them for the meal.  There’s no going to the grocery store and buying something in a bottle or a can.  Everything is done from  the original ingredients; that’s making something from scratch.  “Scratch” has a coupl e of other meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for this episode that will give you some additional explanations. 

Gil says that his mother uses these recipes that were passed d own to her from her mother, Gil’s grandmother.  A “recipe” is a writte n set of instructions – of steps – that tells you how to make a certain kind of food , what we would call a certain “dish,” which is the thing that you are preparin g made from other ingredients – from other things.  His mother got these  recipes that she uses from her mother; they were passed down to her.  To “pass down ” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to give something to someone in the  next generation.  So when a father gives his son his wedding ring, or gives hi s daughter some  

 important book that has been part of the family for ma ny years, that’s to pass something down.  Usually it’s something valuable, at least  to the family. 

Gil says his mother “can make the most intricate dishes, b ut what I’m craving are the comfort foods she always made for us when we were kids. ”  Something that is “intricate” (intricate) is very complicated, very complex, a  lot of details, a lot of ingredients in order to make that particular kind of f ood – that dish.  But Gil doesn’t want an intricate dish, he’s “craving,” meaning  he has a very strong sense of wanting, particularly food – he’s craving comfort food.  “Comfort food” is food that is very familiar to you, often it’s the kind o f food that you ate as a child, and so eating it again makes you feel comfortable.  It makes you feel like you were a child, innocent and protected, things that would  make you feel comfortable.  Chicken noodle soup is for some people comfo rt food.  For me, comfort food would, hmm, probably be a jelly sandwich – yes, that’s a comfort food! 

Gil says that it makes my mouth water just thinking about h er cooking.  “To make your mouth water” means that when you think of a parti cular food it starts to make you feel hungry, and when you start to feel hungry your mouth begins to what we call “salivate,” it fills with water.  So, some thing that makes your mouth water is something that is very good tasting, something t hat is delicious. 

Louise says that after a year of living on instant noodles and take-out food, I’m not surprised you want something home-cooked.  “Instant” means immediate. When we talk about “instant” with food, we’re talking  about food that can be prepared in a very short period of time.  For example, a food that’s very popular especially among college students because it’s cheap is ram en noodles, at least here in Los Angeles.  Ramen noodles is a Japanese food, b ut it can be prepared very quickly if you buy the noodles already prepared in a p ackage at the store. So instant noodles would be that kind of food; you pour  hot water in it and you can you eat it.  “Take-out food” is food that you buy fro m a restaurant and bring back to your home, you don’t eat it at the restaurant.  In the U.S., that’s called take-out food. 

Louise says, “I tell you what.”  “I tell you what” is a p hrase you use when you are proposing or suggesting an idea to another person.  You  can also say “I’ll tell you what,” both of those are possible.  Louise says, “After t he party (the coming home party – the welcome-home party), come over to my ho use and I’ll have a home-cooked meal ready for you.”  Gil says, “You, cook for m e?  Thanks, but no thanks!”  “Thanks, but no thanks” means you appreciate the person offering or suggesting to do something for you, but you don’t want to do it.  It’s often used  

 somewhat sarcastically or humorously to say I don’t really wan t to do that at all, that’s not a good thing that you are offering me 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
