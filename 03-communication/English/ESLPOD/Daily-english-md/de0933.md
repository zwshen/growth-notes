This episode is a dialogue between Emma and Uday ab out forgetting about things that have happened to you in the past. Let’s  get started.

[start of dialogue]

Emma: I think it’s time.

Uday: I beg to differ.

Emma: You can’t live in the past. I know that you l ike reliving your glory days, but the only way to move on is to let go of the past.

Uday: I don’t want to move on. If you’ve had the li fe I’ve had, you’d cling to the past, too.

Emma: But your best days are still to come. Constan tly harking back to days gone by doesn’t allow you to live in the moment and  to plan for the future.

Uday: So what? I have my memories to comfort me in my old age.

Emma: You’re speaking as though your life were over . You’re still young.

Uday: Not as young as I used to be.

Emma: These old trophies and football jerseys won’t  keep you young.

Uday: Yes, but they help me remember some of the hi ghlights of the old days. Did I ever tell you about the time I single-handedl y won the game?

Emma: Uh . . .

[end of dialogue]

Emma begins our dialogue by saying to Uday, “I thin k it's time.” “It's time” is a phrase we use to mean that something should be done  right now, immediately, without waiting. We’re not sure exactly what Emma i s talking about, however – what needs to be done right now. We don't know yet.  We do know that Uday then says, “I beg to differ.” “To beg (beg) to differ” i s an old phrase, a very formal phrase that is used to show that you disagree with another person. “I beg to differ” means I think you're wrong, or I disagree w ith you.

Emma says, “You can't live in the past.” “To live i n the past” is to spend all of your time thinking about things that have happened to you last year, last month, maybe 20 years ago. That would be to live in the pa st – not to be thinking about your future or even your present, but to be constan tly thinking about things that you did many years ago. Emma says, “I know that you  like reliving your glory days, but the only way to move on is to let go of t he past.” “To relive” means to live again. Really, it means to experience somethin g again or to think about something as if it were happening right now.

“To relive your glory days” would be to continue to  think about, or try to do again, the things that you did in your “glory days,” or the days when you were popular or successful. The term “glory days” refers to the bes t days of your life. There was a song by Bruce Springsteen many years ago called “Gl ory Days,” about someone who was looking back at the times when he was succe ssful in his life.

Emma says that it's fun to relive your glory days, “but the only way to move on is to let go of the past.” “To move on” means to conti nue with the future without thinking about things that have happened in the pas t. Usually we use this expression, this phrasal verb, when something bad h as happened to us, and perhaps it's preventing us from moving forward, fro m continuing with our lives. Your girlfriend decides to break up with you. You n eed to move on – you need to find another girlfriend who will also, of course, b reak up with you, but that's not the idea here.

“To move on” means to continue forward with your li fe without worrying about the past. Emma also uses the expression here “to let go  of the past.” “To let go of the past” means something similar: to stop thinking abo ut things that have happened in the past and, instead, to think about your futur e.

Uday says, “I don't want to move on. If you’ve had the life I’ve had, you’d cling to the past, too.” “To cling” (cling) means to hold ti ghtly onto something. However, here it means to think about your past all the time  – not to be able to forget about it. “To cling to your past” would be the opposite o f “letting go of your past.” “To let go of” something means to stop holding it, to stop gripping it. Uday doesn't want to let go of the past. He wants to cling to the pas t.

Emma says, “But your best days are still to come.” Emma is saying that the best things in Uday’s life haven't happened yet, so he s hould be looking forward to what will happen to him, not thinking about the pas t. Emma says, “Constantly harking back to days gone by doesn't allow you to l ive in the moment and to plan for the future.” “To hark (hark) back to” something  means to refer to something that happened in the past, to remind you of somethi ng that has happened in the past. “Days gone by” is a somewhat poetical way of saying “the past” – things that have already happened.

Emma says that you can't “live in the moment” and “ plan for the future” if you are constantly thinking about the past. “To live in the  moment” means to live in the present – to think about and focus on what is happe ning to you right now, not what happened to you yesterday or 10 years ago – an d not to think about what will happen even in the future, but instead to thin k about what is going on in your life right now, at this very minute. Emma is asking  Uday to forget about his past and to live in the moment, as well as to plan for t he future.

Uday says, “So what? I have my memories to comfort me in my old age.” Uday is saying “So what,” meaning “Why is that important?” What you are saying to me isn’t important. “I have my memories to comfort me. ” Your “memories” are things that you remember. “To comfort” means to make you f eel calm or relaxed, to feel good about yourself. Uday is saying that he has his  memories to comfort him in his old age – as he gets older.

Emma says, “You’re speaking as though your life wer e over. You're still young.” Uday says, “Not as young as I used to be.” He means  he's not as young as he was last year or 10 years ago, which of course is o bvious. No one is younger now than they were in the past; that doesn't make a ny sense. The reason Uday says this is to indicate that he is aware that he i s getting older. He is no longer as young as he wants to be.

When someone says, “not as young as I used to be,” it means “I'm old. I don't feel young the way I used to feel young.” I feel th at way sometimes. When I have to move some heavy boxes, for example, and the next  day my back hurts, I say

to myself, “I'm not as young as I used to be.” I tr y to tell my wife that so that I don't have to move the boxes, but she never listens .

Anyway, Emma says, “These old trophies and football  jerseys won't keep you young.” A “trophy” (trophy) is usually an object th at looks like a small statue that is given to someone who wins a competition. It is u sually tall, made of metal and wood, and has the name of the person who won, or at  least the prize that they won. “Trophies” are usually given for big competiti ons – sporting competitions or other events.

Emma says, “These old trophies and football jerseys  won't keep you young.” A “jersey” (jersey) is a shirt that you wear when you  are participating in some athletic activity. When you are a member of a sport s team, you have team jerseys. They all have the same color, the same des ign. Typically, jerseys will have numbers on them. That's your number as a playe r. In my glory days as an 8th grade volleyball player, I had the number 10. T hat was the number on my jersey. Oh, those were the days.

Emma says the “old trophies and football jerseys” –  and here she means American football – “won't keep you young.” You won 't become young by keeping these old things. Uday says, “Yes, that's t rue, but they help me remember some of the highlights of the old days.” “ Highlights” are the best or most important moments or parts of some story or so me situation.

Uday says, “Did I ever tell you about the time I si ngle-handedly won the game?” Uday is asking Emma if she remembers him telling the story about how, during one game, he “single-handedly” won it. “Single-hand edly” means alone, without help from anyone else.

Of course, husbands like to tell their wives storie s of their glory days, and usually they tell them many, many times, and I think that's  the situation here with Emma. Emma says, “Uh . . . ,” meaning she does know the s tory and she doesn't really want to hear it again.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
