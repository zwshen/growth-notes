This episode is a dialog between Ron and Nancy abou t using drugs that are illegal. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Nancy:  So, what do you think?

Ron:  Uh, that was interesting.

Nancy:  That’s all you have to say?  I spent six mo nths making this anti-drug film to show students in schools to try and deter illega l drug use.

Ron:  Well, I’m not sure if it gets the point acros s.

Nancy:  What do you mean?  I show footage of people  using hardcore drugs.

Ron:  That’s just it.  You start by showing people smoking pot, making the point that it’s a gateway drug, and then showing addicts popping pills, shooting up heroine, and snorting and freebasing cocaine.

Nancy:  I’m trying to show the downhill spiral that  results from illegal drug use.

Ron:  But considering how incredibly explicit the f ilm is, I’m afraid that teachers might mistake it for some other type of film.

Nancy:  What do you mean?  What type of film?

Ron:  Well, instead of an anti-drug educational fil m, it seems more instructional. If kids didn’t know how to use illegal drugs before , they will after watching this film!

Nancy begins our dialogue by saying to Ron, “So wha t do you think?” What is your opinion (of something)? Ron says, “Uh, that wa s interesting.” Notice: the way that he says that indicates that he perhaps doe sn't like it or disagrees with it. This is a common, polite way that people sometimes indicate to others that they have an opinion that perhaps disagrees with the per son they're talking to, and that the person they're talking to won't like. Some one may ask, “What you think of my new shirt?” And you think it's really ugly. You might say, “Oh, that's interesting.” Of course, if you say it that way the n they know exactly what you're really saying.

Nancy says, “That's all you have to say? I spent si x months making this anti-drug film to show students in schools to try and deter i llegal drug use.” So Nancy has made a movie, a film, that is an “anti-drug” film. “Anti (anti) –“ usually means against. You can be antidiscrimination. You are aga inst discrimination. You don't like it. “Anti-drug” would be someone who is agains t drugs, who opposes drugs – in this case, drugs that people use for what we mig ht call “recreational purposes,” just for fun.

Nancy made this anti-drug film “to show students in  schools to try and deter illegal drug use.” “To deter” (deter) means to disc ourage someone from doing something. “To deter” means to try to get someone not  to do something. So, if you have a law against guns, you're trying to deter  violence. You're trying to prevent violence. Here, we’re trying to prevent peo ple from using drugs illegally. “Illegal” (illegal) means “not legal” – in this cas e, drugs that people are not supposed to use without permission.

Ron says, “Well, I'm not sure if it gets the point across.” “To get the point across” means to make yourself clear, to make your message clear, to very clearly communicate what you're trying to say to the other person. Nancy says, “What do you mean? I show footage of people using hardcore d rugs.” “Footage” (footage) refers to video or film, but usually just one part of a movie, or one part of a show, or one part of a video. The word is used generally to talk about a video or a film of something, often that is part of a larger film o r larger video. “Footage” might also refer to just a short piece of video.

Nancy says, “I show footage of people using hardcor e drugs.” The word “hardcore” (hardcore) – one word – means extreme, t he most serious type of something, usually something that's negative. At le ast that was the traditional use of this word “hardcore.” If you talk about “hardcor e drugs,” you are saying that

these were very bad drugs, drugs that would cause p erhaps an extreme reaction in the person, drugs like cocaine or heroin.

In the last 20 years or so, people, especially youn ger people, have started to use the word to describe a very intense or extreme expe rience, or someone who is really committed to or devoted to a certain kind of  activity. Someone who goes swimming every day for three hours might be describ ed as a “hardcore swimmer” – someone who's really dedicated, who’s extreme in their dedication. But here, it means drugs that are potentially very dangerous.

Ron says, “That's just it.” That's the problem. “Yo u start by showing people smoking pot, making the point that it's a gateway d rug.” “Pot” (pot) is an informal word for marijuana, the illegal drug that comes fro m the cannabis plant. “To smoke pot” would be to smoke a marijuana cigarette.  There are lots of names for marijuana cigarettes. The most common, at least whe n I was growing up, was “joint” (joint). People talked about “smoking joint s.” (Well, not me …other people!)

Ron says that in the movie, Nancy shows people smok ing pot – “making the point” – trying to communicate the idea – “that it' s a gateway drug.” The term “gateway (gateway) drug” refers to a drug that is n ot very harmful, that doesn't have very serious effects, but that might lead peop le to want more and more drugs – drugs that are more serious that do  have more serious effects. Marijuana is not considered a hardcore drug. It doesn't have serious effects on people when they take it. It's not seriously addicting – at lea st, as much as marijuana and cocaine, I don't think. I don't know. I have not tr ied any of these drugs, but many people believe that if you allow people to smoke ma rijuana legally, that will lead them to more serious drugs.

“Gateway” is a word that comes from “gate” (gate) w hich is the…doors to an open space, usually a garden or the front of your h ouse, not the door of your house but – the property of your house might have a  fence around it and in order to go through the fence, you go through a “gate.” I t's an entrance. So, “gateway” refers to the place where you would enter into some thing. In this case, you would enter into the world of more serious drugs.

So, Nancy begins her film by showing people smoking  marijuana, and then showing “addicts popping pills, shooting up heroin,  and snorting and freebasing cocaine.” There are several drug-related terms in t hat sentence, that clause. Let's go through them briefly.

The first word is “addict” (addict). An “addict” is  a person who is reliant on or addicted to some sort of drug, some sort of chemica l substance. Usually, we use

this word in talking about someone who has a seriou s drug addiction, a serious drug problem with hardcore drugs such as cocaine an d heroin.

“To pop (pop) pills” means to swallow a lot of pill s. It's often an expression we use to indicate someone who abuses drugs, especiall y drugs that you may get from your doctor for legitimate reasons, for good r easons, but then you take too many of them. You start taking them just to feel go od. That's to “pop pills.”

“To to shoot up heroin” means to inject an illegal drug called heroin into your skin, into your blood vessels, in order to feel the  effects of the drug. People who are “shooting up” are people who are using drugs th at require that you stick a needle, a sharp point, into your skin in order to p ut the drugs right into your body.

Finally, we talk about “snorting and freebasing coc aine.” “Cocaine” is another hardcore drug, illegal drug. “To snort” (snort) mea ns to breathe in with your nose. This verb can be used to describe someone who may make a funny sound when they laugh like [laughs and snorts] – like that. Bu t in talking about drugs, “to snort” is to breathe in, in order to get the drug i nto your body through your nose. “To freebase” (freebase) means to heat cocaine in o rder to prepare it to be smoked. You are converting the cocaine in order to smoke it instead of snorting it.

Nancy says, “I'm trying to show” – with her film – “the downhill spiral that results from illegal drug use.” “Downhill spiral” (spiral) is a situation that is becoming worse and worse. “To go downhill” means to go from the top of a hill to the bottom of the hill. We talk about “downhill skiing, ” for example. A “spiral” is when something goes around in a circle, usually moving i n addition to moving around and around. So, a “downhill spiral” would be a situ ation that is going to down in the sense of getting worse.

Ron says, “But considering how incredibly explicit the film is, I'm afraid that teachers might mistake it for some other type of fi lm.” “To be explicit” (explicit) means to show something directly, with a lot of det ail. This word is like hardcore, sometimes associated, for example, with pornography , for the showing of sexual acts. If we talk about a movie being very explicit,  or having “explicit sexual content,” that's what we’re talking about. It could  also have explicit violence. Usually, “explicit” has a somewhat negative connota tion, a negative meaning.

Nancy says, “What do you mean?” What type of film? Ron is saying that teachers might think this is a different kind of film. Ron s ays, “Well, instead of being an anti-drug educational film, it seems more instructi onal.” “Instructional” means something that is designed to teach people how to d o something.

 Ron says, “If kids didn’t know how to use illegal d rugs before,” meaning before watching the film, “they will after watching this f ilm.” Ron is saying that the film is so explicit. It shows in detail so much about how t o use drugs, that it might actually have the opposite effect. It might show ch ildren how drugs are used rather than warning them against using those drugs.

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialog]

Nancy:  So, what do you think?

Ron:  Uh, that was interesting.

Nancy:  That’s all you have to say?  I spent six mo nths making this anti-drug film to show students in schools to try and deter illega l drug use.

Ron:  Well, I’m not sure if it gets the point acros s.

Ron:  Well, instead of an anti-drug educational fil m, it seems more instructional. If kids don’t know how to use illegal drugs before,  they will after watching this film!

Our scriptwriter knows how to get the point across in her very instructional dialogs, and she does it all without smoking pot.
