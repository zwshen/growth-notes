This episode is a dialogue about dread – of not wan ting to do something because of the fear of what might happen. Let’s get started . 

[start of dialogue] 

Brianna: Are you still here? I thought you left age s ago. 

Viktor: There’s no rush. I’m thinking of postponing  until tomorrow. 

Brianna: Why? 

Viktor: I feel a sense of foreboding. I have a snea king suspicion that things aren’t going to go well. 

Brianna: Under the circumstances, I can understand your reluctance, but it’s like ripping off a bandage. It’s best done quickly. 

Viktor: I’m not sure about that. I have a feeling t hat things are going to go very, very wrong, and the longer I can put it off the bet ter. 

Brianna: Next week is your girlfriend’s birthday. Y ou don’t want to break up with her on her birthday, do you? 

Viktor: No, that would be cruel. Maybe I should hol d off until after next week. 

Brianna: You’re really dreading breaking up with he r, aren’t you? 

Viktor: She’s got a temper. When I told her that I couldn’t join her on a visit to her parents’ house last weekend, she went ballistic, an d I have dents in my car door to show for it. I expect this to be much, much wors e. 

Brianna: Ah, I see. I never liked the idea of break ing up with someone remotely, but it might be called for in this case.

Brianna asks Viktor, “Are you still here? I thought  you left ages ago.” “Ages (ages) ago (ago)” means here “a long time ago.” Vik tor says, “There’s no rush,” meaning there’s no hurry. There’s no reason for me to leave right away or immediately. In fact, Viktor says, “I’m thinking of  postponing until tomorrow.” “To postpone” (postpone) means to do something later, n ot to do it now. Another verb here we could use is “to delay” (delay).  

Brianna asks Viktor why he’s thinking of postponing  until tomorrow. Viktor says, “I feel a sense of foreboding.” “Foreboding” (forebodi ng) is not a common word in English conversation. It means an anxious feeling t hat something bad will happen. You have a sense, a feeling, an emotion tha t something bad will happen in the future. Viktor says, “I have a sneaking susp icion that things aren’t going to go well.”  

A “sneaking (sneaking) suspicion (suspicion)” is a belief that something bad will happen. It’s very similar to this idea of “forebodi ng.” The word “foreboding” is usually used when something really bad is going to happen, something perhaps even evil. “Sneaking suspicion” is usually used in a less serious situation, where you know something is bad or you know something not  good may happen, but it’s not going to be something terrible.  

Sometimes we use this expression “sneaking suspicio n” when you think another person is hiding something from you or you think th at something is going on that shouldn’t be going on. “I have a sneaking suspicion  that Bill isn’t really sick today. He decided to go to the beach with his girlfriend. That’s why he’s not here at work.” That would be an example of using that expre ssion when there isn’t something horrible that is happening or going to ha ppen. 

Brianna says, “Under the circumstances, I can under stand your reluctance, but it’s like ripping off a bandage. It’s best done qui ckly.” “Reluctance” (reluctance) is a hesitation or unwillingness to do something. You’ re not sure you really want to do it. You sort of wait and stop and think “Hmm, sh ould I really do this?” That’s a  

“reluctance,” an unwillingness to do something. Bri anna can understand Viktor’s reluctance. “But,” she says, “it’s like ripping off  a bandage” (bandage). 

 A “bandage” is something you put on your skin when  you cut yourself. You put it over the cut. “To rip off a bandage” is to take it off your skin quickly. Of course, you take off a bandage quickly so that it doesn’t h urt as much, or you get the pain over in a very short period of time. That’s what Br ianna is suggesting that Viktor do. Obviously Viktor is thinking about something th at he doesn’t want to do that will be painful, and that’s why it’s best to do it quickly, Brianna says.  

Viktor disagrees. He says, “I’m not sure about that . I have the feeling,” meaning I think or I believe, “that things are going to go ve ry, very wrong.” For something “to go very, very wrong” is for bad things to happe n as a result of whatever you’re going to do or whatever someone else is going to do . Viktor believes “The longer I can put it off, the better.” The two-word phrasal  verb “to put something off” means the same as “to postpone” or “to delay” – to do something later, usually because you don’t want to do it now.  

Brianna says, “Next week is your girlfriend’s birth day. You don’t want to break up with her on her birthday, do you?” Now we learn wha t Viktor is worried about. He wants to break up with his girlfriend. “To break up  with” someone is to end a romantic relationship with someone, usually someone  that you are not married to yet, someone you are “dating,” we would say. 

Viktor says, “No.” He doesn’t want to break up with  his girlfriend on her birthday. “That would be cruel” (cruel). “Cruel” is very mean , very inconsiderate, we might say. “Cruel” is actually more than inconsiderate. I t’s something that really hurts another person. Viktor says, “Maybe I should hold o ff until after next week.” “To hold off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to wai t to do something later. It’s similar to “to delay” or “to postpone.”  

Brianna says, “You’re really dreading breaking up w ith her, aren’t you?” “To dread” (dread) means to not want to do something be cause you are worried or afraid about what might happen. “I dread talking to  my mother-in-law.” I don’t really want to. I have a feeling that it’s not goin g to be very pleasant. Perhaps I’m even fearful of what might happen. You might dread taking a test at school because you know you may not do very well on it. Yo u’re fearful about what will happen. Brianna thinks that Viktor is dreading brea king up with his girlfriend.  

Viktor apparently is dreading breaking up with her,  in part because he says she has a temper. Viktor says, “She’s got a temper.” “S he’s got a temper” means the same as “she has a temper.” “To have a temper” (tem per) means to lose control  

of your emotions easily, to be someone who often ge ts upset and angry. We often think of a young child as having a “temper” i f the child gets angry easily. But adults also have a temper. Someone who easily gets upset at things or starts yelling at other people because something goes wron g is someone who has a temper.  

Viktor says, “When I told her I couldn’t join her o n a visit to her parents’ house last weekend, she went ballistic.” Viktor told his girlfriend that he could not go with her when she was going to visit her parents la st weekend. When this happened, Viktor says, the girlfriend “went ballist ic” (ballistic). The phrasal verb “to go ballistic” means to become extremely angry a nd to lose control of your emotions – to start shouting and screaming, for exa mple.  

Viktor says he has dents in his car door to show fo r it. A “dent” (dent) is a small section of something that has been pushed in, that is no longer flat or smooth. If you have a car and someone hits your car – the side  of your car, especially – you will probably get a dent in the side of your car. T he metal will go in. There will be what we call an “indentation.” Well, it’s obvious t hat Viktor’s girlfriend got so angry at him that she hit his car and caused a dent . That’s what happens when she goes ballistic, I guess.  

This is what Viktor has “to show for it.” The expre ssion “to show for it” means to have as a result of something else happening. He sa ys, “I expect this to be much, much worse,” meaning if he breaks up with her , she will get even more angry. Brianna says, “Ah, I see,” meaning “Yes. I u nderstand.” “I never liked the idea of breaking up with someone remotely, but it m ight be called for in this case.”  

To do something “remotely” (remotely) is to do it f rom a distance. Many people now work remotely. They don’t go into their office.  They stay at home and work on their computer and use the internet to communica te with other people. That’s “working remotely.” Brianna is suggesting perhaps t hat Viktor break up with his girlfriend “remotely” – maybe send her a text messa ge or tweet her or put something on his Facebook page like “Now I’m single .”  

In any case, Brianna thinks that breaking up with t he girlfriend remotely might be “called for in this case.” “To be called for” means  to be appropriate, to be necessary or required in this particular situation.  I have to say, I never had a difficult breakup with my girlfriends. Usually they  broke up with me, so I didn’t have to worry about it too much until after it happ ened.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
