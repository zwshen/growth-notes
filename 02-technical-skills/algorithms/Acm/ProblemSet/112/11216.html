<h1>Problem I</h1>
<h2>Irrigation</h2>
</center>

<p>You have a piece of land, which is divided into an <i>n</i>*<i>m</i> grid. In some squares there 
is a water source capable of providing water for a certain number of other squares. A water source 
can provide water for zero or more consecutive squares directly to the north, zero or more consecutive 
squares directly to the east and so on. </p>

<p>Water is precious, so you have just enough water to irrigate the whole piece of land. So it's 
crucial to design an irrigation system so that every square is either a water source or irrigated by exactly one water source.</p>

<p>Here is an example. Water sources are represented in the form <b>id(water)</b>. So the 4-th water is 
capable of provide water for 5 other squares.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
The input consists of at most 50 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing three 
non-negative integers <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> and <i>k</i> (1 <= <i>n</i>,<i>m</i> <= 30, 1 <= <i>k</i> <= 200), 
where <i>k</i> is the number of water sources. In the following <i>k</i> lines water sources are 
described, by three non-negative integers <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>c</i>(1 <= <i>x</i> <= <i>n</i>, 1 <= <i>y</i> <= <i>m</i>), 
the coordinate and water capacity (west-south corner is (1,1)), one line for each water source. 
It is guaranteed that <i>nm</i> - <i>k</i> = <i>c</i><sub>1</sub > + <i>c</i><sub>2</sub> + ... + <i>c<sub>k</sub></i> (just enough water). The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

<h2>Output</h2>
For each test case, print the case number in the first line, then <i>k</i> lines followed, 
one for each water source. Each water source is described by four non-negative integers <i>n</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>w</i>, 
the amount of squares irrigated in each direction. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. 
Print a blank line after each test case.
