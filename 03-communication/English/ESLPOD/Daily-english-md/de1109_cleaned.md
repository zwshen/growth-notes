Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,109 – Reading Poor Handwriting. 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,109. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Lily and Hassan about handwriting – you know, using your hand to wr ite on a piece of paper. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Lily: Can you make out what this says?  

Hassan: Geez, who wrote that? 

Lily: My doctor. She wrote down some instructions f or me, but I can’t read her handwriting. 

Hassan: I have no idea what that chicken scratch sa ys.  

Lily: I think that’s a “T,” but maybe it’s an “F.”  

Hassan: Face it. Those scribbles are illegible. Why  don’t you take a photo of that and email it to her nurse? Maybe she can decipher i t for you. 

Lily: I feel like if I just keep at it, I’ll be abl e to work it out.  

Hassan: Patients shouldn’t have to try and read a d octor’s sloppy writing. What if they misinterpret it and do the wrong thing as part  of their treatment? 

Lily: This note isn’t that bad. I think I might hav e the first two words figured out already. 

Hassan: Then you’re better at reading bad penmanshi p than I am. Maybe you should have a try at these English essays. I have 6 0 of them to grade. 

Lily: Wow, looking at these, I’d say you have 60 fu ture doctors in the making!

Lily asks Hassan, “Can you make out what this says? ” The phrasal verb “to make out” (out) here means to be able to understand some thing that someone has said or that someone has written, to be able to read som ething. If, for example, you pick up something and you’re trying to read the ser ial number – the numbers that come on an object to identify it, especially an ele ctronic object – usually the serial numbers are written with very small print. They’re not very large, and so they’re difficult “to make out.” They’re difficult to read.   

Hassan says, “Geez, who wrote that?” “Geez” (geez) is a word used to express surprise, or amazement, or perhaps annoyance – when  something bothers you. Hassan is asking Lily who wrote this note or messag e that she’s trying to read. Lily says, “My doctor.” This is a bit of a joke, of  course. At least in the United States, doctors have the reputation of having very poor “handwriting” – that is, the writing that they make with a pen or a pencil w ith their hands. Lily says her doctor wrote down some instructions for her, but sh e can’t read her handwriting.  

Hassan says, “I have no idea what that chicken scra tch says.” The term “chicken scratch” (scratch) is an informal one referring to handwriting that is very difficult to read – that is very, we might say, “sloppy” (slo ppy). If something is “sloppy,” it’s not neat and organized. It’s not done with car e. If someone described your handwriting as “chicken scratch,” he or she is bein g somewhat insulting, saying that your handwriting is very sloppy, almost as if a chicken had written it. I don’t know why a chicken. That’s just the expression. 

Lily is trying to read the note. She says, “I think  that’s a ‘T,’ but maybe it’s an ‘F.’” Lily is pointing to different letters on the piece of paper, trying to guess what they are. Hassan says, “Face it. Those scribbles are ill egible.” The expression “face (face) it (it)” is used to tell someone that he or she needs to recognize the truth of what one is saying. It’s usually used when someone is trying to deny something that is obviously true, or that perhaps the person knows is true but doesn’t want to admit.  

Hassan says, “Those scribbles are illegible.” “Scri bble” (scribble) as a verb refers to writing something down quickly. “Scribbles” as a  noun would refer to writing that was done very quickly and not carefully. The t erm “illegible” (illegible) means  

impossible to read, usually because the handwriting  is very bad. Hassan says, “Why don’t you take a photo of that and email it to  her nurse?” Hassan is suggesting that Lily take a photograph and email th at photograph to the nurse of her doctor. “Maybe she” – assuming now the nurse is  a woman – “can decipher it for you.”  

“To decipher” (decipher) means to be able to unders tand the meaning of something that has been written in another code or system or even language. “To decipher” something means to figure it out, to be able to understand it. Governments, for example, often communicate using s pecial secret codes that no one else can understand. These are codes, of cou rse, that the country’s enemies try to decipher, try to figure out.  

Hassan is referring to the doctor’s writing, not so me special secret code. He recommends getting the doctor’s nurse to decipher i t. Lily says, “I feel like if I just keep at it, I’ll be able to work it out.” A couple of common expressions there. The first one is “to keep at it.” “To keep at it” or “t o keep at” something means to continue to do it even though it is difficult or ch allenging. It’s the opposite of giving up. If you give up, you stop. You quit. If y ou continue working on it even though it’s difficult, we would say you are “keepin g at it.”  

Lily uses another very common expression: “to work something out.” “To work something out” is to find the answer to some questi on or solution to some problem that is very difficult, that is very challe nging. “To figure something out” is “to work it out.” “To work it out” usually involves  a very complicated problem. If, for example, you like to read detective fiction – n ovels about private investigators and police who investigate crimes – you might be so meone who likes to work out the solution, who tries to figure out who committed  the crime, who committed the murder.  

There are lots of, of course, famous writers of det ective fiction in English. People like Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers from the ea rly to mid part of the twentieth century, and of course many, many others.  I personally love watching detective shows. I’ve watched probably thousands of  them. I love watching a good mystery and trying to work it out. I never do,  of course. My wife works it out like halfway through the show, and I am always surp rised at the end and she’s already worked it out a long time ago. She’s much s marter than I am, of course.  

Anyway Hassan says, “Patients shouldn’t have to try  and read a doctor’s sloppy writing.” We talked about “sloppy” earlier on as be ing not very carefully done. “What if they,” meaning the patients, “misinterpret  and do the wrong things as part of their treatment?” “To misinterpret” somethi ng is to misunderstand  

something, to come to the wrong conclusion. If a pa tient misinterprets the doctor’s instructions, they could be doing the wron g thing in terms of their treatment. “Treatment” refers to medical care – thi ngs that you or your doctor does to make you feel better, to get better physica lly.  

Lily says, “This note isn’t that bad. I think I mig ht have the first two words figured out already.” “Figured out,” of course, means under stood. Hassan says, “Then you’re better at reading bad penmanship than I am.”  “Penmanship” (penmanship) is just another word for handwriting. You don’t hea r the word that often anymore now that we live in a world of computers and textin g. In fact, some parents complain that the schools no longer teach good penm anship anymore the way they did back when they were young. My school taugh t us good penmanship. The problem is I never really learned it. They trie d to teach me, but I was never very good at it.  

Hassan says, “Maybe you should have a try at these English essays.” It appears that Hassan is a teacher and he has to read some ha ndwritten essays. An “essay” (essay) is a short written document, often done as part of a school assignment. The teacher will tell students to write  several paragraphs in order to demonstrate their knowledge of a certain topic. Thi s is often done on a test that is given to the class. Hassan says that he has 60 of t hese essays “to grade” – to give a score to as the teacher.  

Lily says, “Wow, looking at these, I’d say you have  60 future doctors in the making!” Lilly is making a joke. She’s saying that all of Hassan’s students have bad handwriting, have poor handwriting, which must mean that someday they will become doctors. That’s why she says “60 future doct ors in the making.” If something is “in the making,” it is in the process of being made or formed. It’s not finished yet – it’s not in its completed form yet –  but it is in the process of being completed.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed. 

[start of dialogue] 

Lily: Can you make out what this says?  

Hassan: Geez, who wrote that? 

Lily: My doctor. She wrote down some instructions f or me, but I can’t read her handwriting.

Lily: Wow, looking at these, I’d say you have 60 fu ture doctors in the making!

Our scriptwriter’s handwriting is never sloppy. Tha t’s because she’s always very careful. I speak, of course, of the wonderful Dr. L ucy Tse.
