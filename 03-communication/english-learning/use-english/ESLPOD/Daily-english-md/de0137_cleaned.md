[start of dialog] 

Lucy: Hey Jeff, have you met my friend?  

Jeff: No, I don't think I have.  

Lucy: Well, this is my oldest and best friend, Marl ene. She's visiting from out of town.  

Jeff: Hi, I'm Jeff. 

Marlene: Hi, it's nice meeting you. 

Jeff: How long do you plan to be in town? 

Marlene: I'm here for the long weekend, staying wit h Lucy. We're doing some catching up and I'm getting a break from work. 

Jeff: Oh, what line of work are you in? Are you in the same field as Lucy? 

Marlene: No, I'm in medicine. I'm a doctor, actuall y, a pediatrician. I enjoy the work, but it's nice to get away for a few days. Wha t kind of work do you do?  

Jeff: I work in the education field, but what I rea lly want to do is to become a professional singer.  

Lucy: Jeff has a great voice. He sounds exactly lik e Frank Sinatra.  

Marlene: Really? 

Jeff: No, she's just kidding and Lucy knows that I can't sing. We went to a karaoke bar once and people actually offered me mon ey NOT to sing. 

Lucy: That was a lot of fun. We should do that agai n sometime.  

Jeff: Sure, anytime. Oh, I'd better go. It was nice  meeting you Marlene, and Lucy, I'll talk to you next week. 

Marlene: Nice to meet you, too.  

Lucy: Okay, later. 

[end of dialog] 

In this podcast, we are meeting an out-of-town frie nd. When we say someone is “out of town” (town) we mean they are from somewher e other than where you live. So, if you live in Los Angeles, an out of tow n friend could be from San Francisco or New York City, or Houston, Texas – tho se would all be out of town friends, if they were coming to visit you. The dial og begins with Lucy saying to Jeff, “Have you met my friend?” “Have you met” (met ) – of course, that’s the past tense of “to meet” – so, is this someone that you h ave met? You met them last week or two years ago. And I say, “No, I haven’t. I  don’t think I have.” And Lucy says that this is her “oldest and best friend, Marl ene.” When we use the term “oldest” when we’re talking about friends, we don’t  normally mean older in terms of age like I’m 29 and my friend is 50. And he’s my  oldest friend in age. That’s not what we normally mean. We normally mean this is  one of the friends that I have known for the longest time – period of time – 10 years, 20 years, and so forth.  

Well, Lucy says that she is visiting from out of to wn and then I introduce myself and I say, “Hi. I’m Jeff.” And she responds by sayi ng, “Hi. It’s nice meeting you.” It’s nice meeting you is the same as “It’s nice to meet you.” It’s what we would say to someone the first time we meet them, but onl y the first time. And I say to Marlene – her friend – “How long do you plan to be in town?” meaning how many days or how many weeks will you be visiting this pl ace. Notice the expression “in town.” When we say someone is “in town,” again, we mean they’re in the city or the place where you live. So, they would respond by  saying, “I’m in town for three weeks” –means I will be here for three weeks – so, “out of town” and “in town.” Well, Marlene says that she’s here for a long weeke nd and when we say a “long (long) weekend,” we mean, usually, three or four da ys and that could be Friday, Saturday and Sunday or Thursday, Friday, Saturday a nd Sunday – possibly even  

Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Remember in the United  States we like to have our national holidays on Mondays so we can have a l ong weekend.  

Well, she’s staying – Marlene is staying with Lucy.  And “to stay with someone” means that they are sleeping at their house or thei r apartment. She says that she wants to do some “catching up” and get a break from  work. “To do some catching up” here means that she wants to talk to some of he r friends that she hasn’t talked to in a long time, find out how they are doi ng. She wants to get a “break (break) from work” which means the same as – basica lly a vacation from work. A time when I don’t have to work would be a break.  

I asked Marlene, “What line of work are you in?” “W hat line (line) of work are you in?” And that means what do you do for a living? Wh at is your profession? What is your job, your occupation? You could be a lawyer , for example. You could be a truck driver – that would be your line of work. So,  when we ask someone, “What is your line of work?” or “What line of work are yo u in?” – that is what we’re asking and I ask Marlene also, “Are you in the same  field (field) as Lucy?” A “field” is just another way of saying the same prof ession, the same type of work. It does not mean the same company necessarily – jus t means the same kind of work or the same type of work. And Marlene says tha t she’s not in the same field as Lucy. She’s “in medicine.” “I’m in medicine” mea ns I work in the medical field. I do my job – my job is related to medicine. You ca n say, “Well, I’m in the legal profession,” or “My job is in law (law)” – that wou ld be someone who was a lawyer, for example. And she, in this case, is in m edicine and says that she’s a “pediatrician.” And “pediatrician” is a long word –  pediatrician) is someone who works with children and usually, in the United Stat es, a pediatrician works with babies, children – usually up to the age of about 1 7 or so. So, they could work with children and teenagers – that would be a pedia trician. 

She says she enjoys her work but “it’s nice to get away for a few days.” “To get away” means to take a short vacation somewhere else , somewhere not in your home town. To go to say, Las Vegas, and lose all of  your money by gambling, because, of course, in Las Vegas, it’s a famous pla ce to gamble your money in the United States and, what a great way to spend yo ur time, losing all of your money. 

Anyway, Marlene doesn’t go to Vegas, she goes – com es to Los Angeles. Marlene asked me, “What kind of work do you do?” – meaning very much the same as what line of work are you in – what kind of  work do you do. And I say that I’m in the education field but, of course, my real goal is to become a professional singer. Lucy then says that I have a g reat voice – that I sound just like Frank Sinatra. Frank Sinatra, you probably kno w, is a famous American  

singer from the 1940’s and 50’s and 60’s, who has a  very beautiful voice. Of course, Lucy is joking and I say, “She’s just kiddi ng,” meaning Lucy is just kidding (kidding) – means she’s just joking. She’s just mak ing a joke. I then say that once, we went to a karaoke bar. A “karaoke bar” is a place, you probably know, that you can sing songs and they put the lyrics, th e words to the song. And you stand up in front of everyone else and you have a c ouple of beers – very important – and then you start singing. And usually , it’s pretty bad. And it was originally – very popular in Japan and then became popular in the United States and other countries as well. And I’m sure that’s no t the pronunciation in Japan, but in English we say “karaoke.”  

Well, Lucy says, “We should go to a karaoke bar aga in.” And I say, “Sure, anytime.” But, of course, I don’t want to go back. Then I say, “It was nice meeting you Marlene” – which is again the same with “It’s n ice to meet you.” But when you first meet someone, in the United States, when you’re leaving, when you’re about to leave that person that you just met, you w ould say, “It was nice to meet you.” And she says, “Nice to meet you too,” meaning  it was also nice for me to meet you. Lucy ends the dialog by saying, “Okay. La ter.” And this is an informal expression you hear, especially among younger speak ers. Somebody says, “Later” – means I’ll see you later – will talk to y ou later.”  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time a t a native rate of speech. 

Lucy: Hey Jeff, have you met my friend?  

Jeff: No, I don't think I have.  

Lucy: Well, this is my oldest and best friend, Marl ene. She's visiting from out of town.  

Jeff: Hi, I'm Jeff. 

Marlene: Hi, it's nice meeting you. 

Jeff: How long do you plan to be in town? 

Marlene: I'm here for the long weekend, staying wit h Lucy. We're doing some catching up and I'm getting a break from work. 

Jeff: Oh, what line of work are you in? Are you in the same field as Lucy? 

Marlene: No, I'm in medicine. I'm a doctor, actuall y, a pediatrician. I enjoy the work, but it's nice to get away for a few days. Wha t kind of work do you do?  

Jeff: I work in the education field, but what I rea lly want to do is to become a professional singer.  

Lucy: Jeff has a great voice. He sounds exactly lik e Frank Sinatra.  

Marlene: Really? 

Jeff: No, she's just kidding and Lucy knows that I can't sing. We went to a karaoke bar once and people actually offered me mon ey NOT to sing. 

Lucy: That was a lot of fun. We should do that agai n sometime.  

Jeff: Sure, anytime. Oh, I'd better go. It was nice  meeting you Marlene, and Lucy, I'll talk to you next week. 

Marlene: Nice to meet you, too.  

Lucy: Okay, later.
