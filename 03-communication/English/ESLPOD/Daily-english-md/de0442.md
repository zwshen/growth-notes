This episode is a dialogue between Sue and Alex about so mething called “low- cost airlines,” or airlines that do not charge a lot of money for their airline tickets. We’ll talk about some common vocabulary that we use when talking about traveling by air.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Sue:  I just made airline reservations for our trip.  D o you want to look over the itinerary before I purchase the tickets?

Alex:  Which airline is it?

Sue:  It’s McTse Air.

Alex:  Oh, no, I don’t want to fly on that low-cost air line!  We don’t get assigned seats and all of the passengers rush the gate when boardi ng begins.  I hate that!

Sue:  Not having assigned seats is a small price to pay for low fares.  The service may be stripped down, but I don’t think the experience is that bad.

Alex:  I don’t mind a no-frills flight, but I don’t want to fly out of some tiny airport that’s an hour away.  Which airport would we be depar ting from?

Sue:  It’s the Burbank Airport.  Yes, I know it’s less con venient to fly out of a secondary airport, but I don’t see what the big deal i s.

Alex:  Okay, hand it over.  I’m taking over the planning for our vacation.  I’m not willing to sacrifice comfort to save a few bucks.

Sue:  Fine, be my guest.

In our dialogue Sue says to Alex, “I just made airline r eservations for our trip.” “Airlines” are companies that will fly you in an airplan e from one place to another. “Reservations” are arrangements or contracts or agreement s for you to do something at sometime in the future.  So, “airline re servations” are, really, tickets that you buy for a trip you are going to take in the f uture.  Sue says, “Do you want to look over (do you want to look and examine) the itine rary before I purchase the tickets?”  So, Sue hasn’t paid for the tickets; she made a  reservation.  She went, probably online, and said yes, I want this ticket for this day.  Usually, the airline will give you 24 hours, for example, to actually purchase (or buy) the tickets.  The “itinerary” (itinerary) is the specific information that says when you are going to leave, when you are going to arrive, and so forth.  The  itinerary can include other details or information also, including where you are go ing and how you are getting there.

Alex says, “Which airline is it?”  Sue says, “It’s McTse Air. ”  Alex says, “Oh, no, I don’t want to fly (I don’t want to travel) on that lo w-cost airline!”  Something that is “low-cost” is something that is not expensive, something that is cheap.  Here in the U.S., in Europe, and in other parts of the world  in the last 10 or 15 years there have been many new low-cost airlines that do not charge a lot for the tickets that they sell.  Alex doesn’t like low-cost airlines;  one reason is that you don’t get assigned seats on the plane.  “Assigned seats” are when the airline says what specific seat you can sit in.  Many low-cost airlines , in order to save money, don’t have that system, at least here in the U.S.  You simply go and you take whatever seat is open – that is, is available.

Alex doesn’t like the fact that all of the passengers rush  the gate when boarding begins.  The “passengers” are the people who are traveli ng on the plane.  You can also be a passenger in a bus, on a train, in a car, o n a boat or ship.  “To rush,” in this case, means to do something very quickly.  In this example, “to rush the gate” means to move toward the gate very quickly.  the “gate” is the place where you go through to get onto the airplane; it’s the place where they take your ticket before you get on the airline, or check your ticket.   So, Alex doesn’t like when passengers rush the gate when boarding begins.  “Bo arding” (boarding) is the process of people getting on the plane.  If they a nnounce that the plane is going to board at 3:00, or begin boarding at 3:00, they mean that that is when people are going to start getting on the airplane.  They will allow people (or let people) go onto the airplane itself and get their sea t.

 Sue says, “Not having assigned seats is a small price to pay for low fares.”  “A small price to pay” is something that is easy to do, especia lly when you consider the advantages of doing it.  So for example, going to the doctor once a year and getting an examination is a small price to pay for your health.  It doesn’t cost that much, it isn’t that inconvenient, and it could save your l ife so it’s a small price to pay.  In this case, Sue says that not having assigned seats is a small price to pay for this greater benefit – this greater advantage, whi ch is lower fares.  A “fare” (fare) is the price of a ticket on an airplane, a train , a bus, or a boat.  “Airfare” refers to the price of the tickets.  So, low fares are low airfares, is what Sue is interested in.

Sue says, “The service may be stripped down, but I don’t t hink the experience is that bad.”  When we say something is “stripped down,” we  mean it only has the very basic or essential things; it doesn’t have a lot of nice , comfortable extra things.  So on a low-cost airline they may give you water but if you want soda you have to pay money, or if you want something to eat you  have to pay extra.

Alex says, “I don’t mind a no-frills flight.”  “No-frill s” means basically the same as stripped down, not a lot of extra or fancy things, only the basics.  He says, “I don’t want to fly out of some tiny airport that’s an hour awa y.  To fly out of an airport means to leave from that airport; that’s where the pla ne leaves from, where it takes off from.  To fly out of a tiny airport would be a small airport.  Many of the low-cost airlines in Europe and other places will fly ou t of small airports, not the main airport for example, and so, you have to travel far ther than you might otherwise.  Alex says, “Which airport would we be depart ing from?”  To “depart from” somewhere means to leave a place, especially an ai rport – leaving the place: “The plane departs at 5:00; it departs from the  Burbank Airport.”

Well, Sue says, “It’s the Burbank Airport.”  You have to understand a little bit about Southern California; Burbank is north of the ma in part of the city.  It’s north of where I live.  It would be very inconvenient, or at l east somewhat inconvenient, to have to go to Burbank Airport if you live where I l ive in Los Angeles.  Sue says, “I know it’s less convenient to fly out of a secondary airpo rt, but I don’t see what the big deal is.”  A “secondary airport” is an airport that is part of a larger city but is the less important airport.  So for example, in Lond on Heathrow Airport is the main airport and Gatwick would be a secondary airport.  In Los Angeles, Los Angeles International Airport (or LAX, as we call it)  is the main airport; Burbank, Ontario, and Orange County (or the John Wayne) Airpor ts would be secondary airports.

Sues says that she doesn’t know what the big deal is, meani ng she doesn’t know why Alex thinks this is so important.  Alex says, “Okay, hand it over.”  The

 expression “to hand something over” is used to ask someone to  give you something or let you have something, often times in ord er for you to take over or control the situation.  It’s not something that you wou ld say to be polite; it’s not a polite or nice expression.  “Hand it over,” in this case,  means Alex wants to see the itinerary – wants to see the tickets and where and wh en they will be going.

Alex says, “I’m taking over the planning for our vacation.”   To “take over” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to take con trol of something, to begin to be the person who is the boss or organizes someth ing.  Alex says, “I’m not willing to sacrifice comfort to save a few bucks.”  To “sacrifice,” here, means to give up or not to have to do something.  “Bucks” is an  informal expression for a dollar (money) in the U.S.

Sue says, “Fine, be my guest,” meaning okay, you go ahead and you plan the vacation.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
