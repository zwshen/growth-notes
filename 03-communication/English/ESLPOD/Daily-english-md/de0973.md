[start of dialogue]

Angie: Ooh, it looks like Joanna has her sights set  on you. Look at how she’s giving you the eye.

Kenji: Is she? I hadn’t noticed.

Angie: Watch out, she usually gets what she wants a nd she doesn’t take no for an answer.

Kenji: I’m not interested in Joanna at all. She’s n ot my type.

Angie: Then you’re the only one. Every guy I know t hinks she’s hot. She has a bunch of them at her beck and call.

Kenji: Then she won’t care if I don’t take an inter est in her. I don’t like women who behave as though they’re God’s gift to men.

Angie: Don’t look now, but she’s making a beeline f or you.

Kenji: Then that’s my cue to beat a speedy exit.

Angie: Are you sure you want to give her the brush off?

Kenji: I’m sure. That’s one woman I don’t want to t angle with.

 Our dialogue begins with Angie saying to Kenji, “Oo h, it looks like Joanna has her sights set on you.” “To have your sights set on ” someone means that you are interested in someone, especially in someone with w hom you would like to have a romantic relationship. You can also “have your si ghts set on” an object that you want to acquire or buy or purchase. You can have yo ur sights set on a particular car or one particular computer. In this case, howev er, we’re talking about a woman who has her sights set on Kenji.

Angie says, “Look at how she’s giving you the eye.”  “To give someone the eye” (eye) means, again, to look at them with a certain expression that indicates that you are interested in them romantically. Kenji says , “Is she?” meaning is she giving me the eye? “I hadn’t noticed” – I didn’t re alize. Angie says, “Watch out.” “Watch out” is an expression that means be careful,  or you better use caution. It’s especially used if there’s some sort of danger invo lved.

Angie says, “Watch out, she” – meaning Joanna – “us ually gets what she wants and she doesn’t take no for an answer.” That expres sion – he or she “doesn’t take no for an answer” – means this person is very “persistent,” we would say. This person is going to keep trying to get what he wants and won’t stop until he gets it. In this case, Joanna won’t stop until she gets what she wants. That’s the meaning of this expression “doesn’t take no for an answer.”

Kenji says, “I’m not interested in Joanna at all.” “At all” is a very common phrase used to emphasize the verb in the negative meaning:  not even a little bit. “I’m not interested in watching your cat tonight at all.” Th at means I’m not interested even a little bit. “At all” added at the end of this sen tence here means you are emphasizing that particular point. You really don’t  want to do that thing.

Kenji says, “She’s not my type.” “To be someone’s t ype” (type) means to have the characteristics of someone to whom you would be  romantically attracted. Some men like women with blond hair. Some men like women with brunette hair. Me, I like women with hair. Whatever it is, you are  interested in a certain kind of person, and that kind of person is your “type.” Ken ji says that Joanna is not his type. She’s not the kind of woman that he would nor mally be attracted to. Angie says, “Then you’re the only one. Every guy” – every  man – “I know thinks she’s hot.” “To be hot” (hot) is to be very attractive, to be very good looking.

“She has a bunch of them at her beck and call,” Ang ie says. “She” – again, Joanna – “has a bunch of them at her beck and call. ” A “bunch” (bunch) is a group of something – a group of things or a group of people. In this case, we’re talking about men. Joanna has a bunch of men, a lar ge number of men, at her

beck and call. That expression, “at someone’s beck (beck) and call (call),” means you have a lot of people, in this case, who respond  to your requests and your needs immediately. If you say, “I have this person at my beck and call,” you mean this person will do whatever you want right aw ay.

The expression is used to show in a way how you dom inate or control another person – to make them do whatever you want them to do. It’s not a very common expression anymore, but you will still hear it and certainly read it. Angie says that Joanna has a large group of men at her beck and cal l, meaning there are a lot of men who are very interested in her romantically and  would therefore do whatever she wanted them to do. Kenji says, “Then she won’t care if I don’t take an interest in her.” “To take an interest in” someone means to be concerned about them or to pay attention to them. In this case, it means to be interested in a romantic relationship with this person.

Kenji says, “I don’t like women who behave as thoug h they’re God’s gift to man.” The expression “God’s gift to” someone is used sarc astically, in a joking way, to mean that somebody thinks that he or she is very sp ecial and better than everyone else. In some way, Kenji describes Joanna as thinking that she’s “God’s gift to man,” meaning she’s very beautiful a nd that all men should be interested in her. Angie says, “Don’t look now, but  she’s making a beeline for you.” “To make a beeline” (beeline) for someone mea ns to walk in someone’s direction, directly toward someone, without being d istracted by anything in your way.

If you go to a party and you see that there are som e cookies and snacks on a table, and you’re very hungry, you might make a bee line for that table as soon as you walk into the room. You really want to eat, so you’re going to go right for that location, that table. “To make a beeline for” someo ne means to walk towards someone, especially someone to whom you want to tal k or in whom you are interested. That’s the case with Joanna. She’s obvi ously interested in Kenji in a romantic way.

Kenji says, “Then that’s my cue to beat a speedy ex it.” A “cue” (cue) is a signal reminding you of what to do or when to do it. A “cu e” here is an indication of something. So, when Kenji says, “It’s my cue” to do  something, he means that’s my indication, that’s telling me I should do someth ing, that is a situation where I am being reminded, in a way, to do something. What Kenji wants to do is “to beat a speedy exit.” “To beat (beat) a speedy (speedy) e xit” means to leave very quickly and suddenly – to decide, “Oh, I’m going to  go right now,” and then leave.

We would use this expression when we are trying to escape some dangerous situation or some situation that we want to avoid. There’s another expression, perhaps a little bit more common, called “to beat a  hasty retreat.” “Hasty” (hasty) means the same as speedy. It means very quickly. A “retreat” (retreat) here means to go back from where you were, to go back to  a place where you started from. Usually, we use this word “retreat” when we’r e talking about a battle in a war, when one side in the battle has to go back to where they came from because they’re being beaten by the other side.

“To beat a hasty retreat” means to go back to where  you were because you are being beaten, you are being defeated, and you need to go back and protect yourself – back to the place where you began. It co uld also mean to leave quickly, but it would be used more specifically in the case where you are being defeated in something, and you need to leave quickl y in order to avoid getting completely beaten, I guess.

Angie says, “Are you sure you want to give her the brush off?” “To give someone the brush (brush) off (off)” means to ignore someon e, to reject someone – not to give someone your attention and perhaps even your r espect. Kenji says, “I’m sure. That’s one woman I don’t want to tangle with. ” “To tangle (tangle) with” someone means to become involved with someone in su ch a way that things become very unpleasant, because the person may be a  very difficult person, or it may be a person with whom you will not get along wi th very well.

You could also use this expression when you anticip ate, you expect, that there are going to be problems in dealing with this perso n, and you don’t want to be involved in those problems. Kenji does not want to tangle with Joanna, and so he’s going to leave wherever it is they are and get  away from her. I’ve never had this problem, actually, of a woman making a beeline  for me and me wanting to ignore her. Never had that happen.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Angie: Ooh, it looks like Joanna has her sights set  on you. Look at how she’s giving you the eye.

Kenji: Is she? I hadn’t noticed.

Angie: Watch out, she usually gets what she wants a nd she doesn’t take no for an answer.

Kenji: Then that’s my cue to beat a speedy exit.

Angie: Are you sure you want to give her the brush off?

Kenji: I’m sure. That’s one woman I don’t want to t angle with.
