This episode is called “Being Clean and Dirty.”  It’s a d ialogue between Ray and Debra where they’re talking about how each one of the m is either clean or dirty, using a lot of vocabulary we would use to describe someone  who is either clean or not so clean – dirty.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ray:  My mother is coming for a visit, which means we need  to do some spring cleaning this weekend.

Debra:  I’ll get the duster, if you’ll get the broom.

Ray:  I’m serious.  You know how nit-picky my mother is and  I want our house to be neat and tidy.

Debra:  Fine, fine, I understand.  You don’t want he r to know we live in a pigsty.

Ray:  I’m not saying we live in a pigsty, but the house i s a little messy and dusty. It wouldn’t hurt to straighten up a little bit, tha t’s all.

Debra:  I’m willing to pitch in, but I’m not going t o spend the entire weekend slaving away to get this house spotless.  Your mother won’t  love you any less if you’re not a neat freak.

Ray:  You don’t know my mother very well.

Debra:  I know her well enough.  I don’t want to spo il her fun.  If she can’t complain about our dirty house, what will she complain about?

Ray and Debra are having a conversation about cleaning the house because Ray’s mother is coming to visit.  Ray says, “My mother is comin g for a visit, which means we need to do some spring cleaning this weekend.”  The expression “spring cleaning” is used to describe a period of time wh ere you clean your house very well.  Usually it happens about once a year, often i n the spring, in the early part of the year.  “Spring cleaning,” however, is a gen eral term that means that you’re going to clean everything in your house; you’re g oing to “throw out” or get rid of things you don’t need anymore.  That’s another m eaning of the expression.

Debra says, “I’ll get the duster, if you get the broom.”   A “duster” (duster) is a small tool; it’s a piece of wood or plastic that you hol d on to and it has, usually, either a lot of feathers, like from a bird, or a very light cloth – material – at one end.  It’s used to clean tables and shelves and other th ings in your house that may have a lot of dirt on them – a lot of dust.  A “br oom” is typically a long pole that has at one end either straw or plastic, and it’s use d to clean a floor – to sweep a floor.  The verb “to sweep” means to take, in t his case, a broom and move it across the floor in order to clean it.  Sweeping  with a broom does not involve water or soap; it’s simply removing the things that  are on the floor.

Ray says, “I’m serious,” meaning he thinks Debra is joking.  “You know how nit- picky my mother is and I want our house to be neat and ti dy,” he says.  “Nit- picky” comes from the verb to “nit pick” (nit pick).  To “ni t pick” means to pay a lot of attention to small things and not be happy – not be  satisfied – until everything is perfect.  It’s generally considered a negative descripti on of someone who tries to be too perfect and tries to criticize someone else for every small problem.  Ray says he wants the house to be “neat and tidy.”  To be “ne at and tidy” means to be well organized and clean.  The word “neat” has a cou ple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Debra says, “Fine, fine, I understand (she’s saying “okay, oka y”).  You don’t want her to know we live in a pigsty.”  A “pigsty” (pigsty – one  word) is, literally, a place where pigs live.  But people consider pigs to be very dirt y, so when they talk about a pigsty they’re talking about a very dirty and unor ganized place.  Ray says, “I’m not saying we live in a pigsty, but the house is a little messy and dusty.”  To be “messy” (messy) means to be unorganized, wher e things are not where they should be.  “Dusty” means that there are smal l pieces of dirt on top of the furniture or other parts of the house.

He then says, “It wouldn’t hurt to straighten up a litt le bit, that’s all.”  When someone says “it wouldn’t hurt to...” do something, such  as “it wouldn’t hurt to go

 home a little early so we can get more sleep tonight,” they mean that it would be a good idea, that it would be a helpful thing.  Ray says, “It wouldn’t hurt to straighten up a little bit.”  To “straighten up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to organize things while you are cleaning them, to put things away where they belong.

Debra says, “I’m willing to pitch in.”  To “pitch in” is,  again, a two-word verb meaning to help with a project, to give some assistance to  complete something. Someone who is going to “pitch in” is going to help.  They’re not going to do the whole thing themselves, but they will assist or help someon e else with it.  The word “pitch” has a couple of different – very different  meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Debra says, “I’m not going to spend the entire weekend sl aving away to get this house spotless.”  The expression – the verb to “slave away”  is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to work very hard, to do something d ifficult for a long time. “Spotless” is perfectly clean.  If something is dirty, we m ay say it has a “spot” on it.  For example, if you are at a baseball game and you ’re eating a hot dog and you have some mustard on your hot dog, and some of the mu stard falls onto your shirt, that would create a spot – a spot of dirt –  a small place where it is dirty.  “Spotless” is the opposite of that; it’s perfectl y clean, something with no spots.

Debra says, “Your mother won’t love you any less if you’re not a neat freak.”  The expression “your mother won’t love you any less” means she wo n’t care that much, she’ll still love you even though you are not someth ing.  In this case, you are not a neat freak.  “Neat,” we already know, mean s clean and organized.  The word “freak” (freak) describe someone who does things in t he extreme or someone who does things very strangely, someone who is very w eird.  Again, it’s not usually considered a positive quality in someone.  A “n eat freak” would be someone who wants everything to be clean all the time eve rywhere, particularly in their own house or home.

Ray says, “You don’t know my mother very well,” meaning may be my mother won’t love me if I’m not a neat freak.  Poor Ray!  Deb ra says, “I know her well enough.”  Of course, Debra is Ray’s mother’s daughter-in- law; she is her mother- in-law, and traditionally there’s always a little fricti on – some difficulties often between the son-in-law and the mother-in-law, or the  daughter-in-law and the mother-in-law, and so forth.

Well, Debra says, “I know her well enough,” meaning I kn ow her sufficiently to be able to say something.  You don’t know them perfectly, b ut you know them

 enough – you know them sufficiently.  Debra says, “I don’ t want to spoil her fun.” To “spoil (spoil) someone’s fun” means to make something less fun for somebody, to make something less enjoyable.  A parent may say to their child, “I don’t mean to spoil your fun, but now you must go to b ed, it is late.  No more television for you!”

Debra says, “I don’t want to spoil (Ray’s mother’s) fun.”  She says, “If she can’t complain about our dirty house, what will she complain about?”  To “complain” means to say that you are unhappy about something, to say that you don’t like something.  If you check into a hotel and your room is di rty, you may call down and complain to the front desk, the people who are resp onsible for the hotel. Debra is saying that Ray’s mother likes to have fun by compl aining about things. There are, of course, people like this in the world – n ot my mother-in-law!  Debra says, “If she can’t complain about our dirty house, what wi ll she complain about?” meaning if we clean up the house she won’t have any fun because she can’t complain.  She, of course, is making a joke here – Debra  is.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
