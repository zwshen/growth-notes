This episode is called “Taking the Driving Test,” a bout taking a test to get your driver’s license for a car.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Cesar:  I just took the driving test.  See this?  T hat’s my new license. 

May:  You have to give me the play-by-play.  I’m ta king the test next week and I’m freaking out. 

Cesar:  There’s nothing to worry about.  It was eas y. 

May:  I’m not worried about the written test.  It’s  the driving test I’m worried about. I haven’t had a lot of practice.  What did you have  to do? 

Cesar:  Well, we got into the car and I fastened my  seat belt.  The examiner had me drive around the block, checking to see that I s topped at the stop signs and traffic signals.   

May:  That sounds okay.  Did you have to drive on t he freeway? 

Cesar:  Yeah, I went on the onramp and merged into traffic.  She had me change lanes and accelerate to pass another driver.  Just don’t forget to signal and don’t go over the speed limit. 

May:  Did you have to parallel park?  That’s what I ’m most worried about. 

Cesar:  Yeah, I parallel parked, but it was easy.  Why are you so worried about the test?    

 May:  I told you.  I haven’t had very much practice . 

Cesar:  Exactly how many times have you been behind  the wheel? 

May:  Well, a few times…maybe two times, and that w as around a parking lot. 

Cesar:  Wow, you’d better get more practice if you’ re going to take the test next week. 

May:  Could you…? 

Cesar:  Uh, sorry, but I’ve got someplace to be. 

[end of dialogue] 

We begin with Cesar saying to May, “I just took the  driving test,” meaning I took the test recently.  A “driving test” is an examinat ion that you have to take in order to get your driving license.  In most U.S. states, you need to take two exams or two tests.  One is written; these are questions abo ut the rules of the road, the laws of driving in that state.  Each state has slig htly different laws, but they’re basically the same.  The second test is what we cal l a “behind the wheel test,” where you actually have to go out with someone who gives you your score.  You have to do certain thing driving on the street, and  if you do everything correct then you get your license – or most things correct.   If you don’t hit another car or kill anyone, then you’ll probably get your license in most places.  Cesar just took his driving test; we assume it’s the behind the whe el test.  He says, “See this? That’s my new license.”  That’s his legal permissio n to drive, that’s what a “license” is.  “License” has some other meanings in  English; take a look at our Learning Guide for those. 

May says, “You have to give me the play-by-play.”  “Play-by-play” is a detailed description of what happened.  In a sports game you  have different plays – different parts of the game.  Each little part of t he game can be called a “play,” and on the television or radio the person who descr ibes everything that is happening in the game is giving the play-by-play, a  detailed description.  We use the expression more generally, outside of the sport s world, to mean a detailed description of something that happened. 

May says, “I’m taking the test (the driving test) n ext week and I’m freaking out.” “To freak (freak) out” is a two-word phrasal verb u sed informally to mean get very worried or nervous about something, so much that it  is controlling all of your  

thoughts and emotions.  Cesar says, “There’s nothin g to worry about.  It was easy.”  May says, “I’m not worried about the writte n test.  It’s the driving test I’m worried about.”  So here, “driving test” refers to I called before the “behind the wheel test.”  Why do we call it “behind the wheel”?   Well, we are talking about the round wheel that you use to direct the car, what we  would say “to steer” the car; in fact, it’s called a “steering wheel.”  So, “behi nd the wheel” means you are sitting there with the wheel in front of you, which  means you are actually in the car driving.   

Anyway, poor May is freaking out; she’s worried abo ut the driving test or the behind the wheel driving test.  She says, “I haven’ t had a lot of practice.  What did you have to do?”  Describe what you had to do.  Cesar says, “Well, we got into the car and I fastened my seat belt.”  So he a nd the person – we would call him or her the “examiner,” probably – got into the car and the first thing Cesar did was fasten his seat belt.  The “seat belt” is a lon g piece of material – of fabric – that goes across your chest and your waist to keep you in your seat.  You wear a seat belt on an airplane when you are taking off – leaving, or landing – coming down onto the ground.  You wear a seat belt in a ca r.  In most states, perhaps in all of them, you are required to wear a seat belt.  If you don’t wear a seat belt you can be fined; you will have to pay money if the pol ice see you not wearing a seat belt.  It’s also, of course, just common sense; it’ s good for your safety to wear a seat belt.  So Cesar fastened his seat belt.  “To f asten” (fasten) usually means to connect two things together so that they will stay together.  You are usually fastening things that can also easily come apart.  We usually use it when we are talking about rope or, in this case, a seat belt, w hich is a long, narrow piece of material.  “The examiner had me drive around the bl ock, checking to see that I stopped at the stop signs and traffic signals.”  In  a city, a “block” is a square area surrounded by four crossing streets.   

Cesar drove around the block so the examiner could check to see that he stopped at the stop signs and traffic signals.  A “ stop sign” is, in the United States, a red, eight-sided sign with the word “STOP ” in white letters.  That’s a stop sign; it tells you you must stop before going forward.  A “traffic signal” – sometimes called a “semaphore,” only by me I think – means a box with three lights – one is red, one is yellow, one is green – that tells you if you need to stop, that’s the red color, of course.  If you can go, th at’s the green color, or if you need to prepare to stop, which would be the yellow color .  Well, we have traffic signals usually where two streets cross, what we would call  an “intersection,” where they come at right angles to each other.  Sometimes you can have a traffic signal in front of what’s called a “pedestrian crossing,” whe re people are allowed to walk across the street.  That could be in the middle of a long block, and that might also  

have a traffic signal in some places.  But usually a traffic signal would be at an intersection, where two streets cross.   

May says, “That sounds okay.  Did you have to drive  on the freeway?”  The “freeway” is a wide road, with usually more than tw o “lanes,” two places where the cars can drive, and they drive very quickly wit hout stopping.  Cesar says, “Yeah, I went on the onramp and merged into traffic .”  The “onramp” (one word) is a little road that leads from the street to the freeway; it’s how you get on a freeway.  The opposite would be an “offramp.”  Cesa r says that he had to merge into traffic.  “To merge” (merge) is when two lanes  of traffic have to come together, so you have to either go in front of the car near you or behind the car that is near you.  Cesar says that the examiner had  him change lanes and accelerate to pass another driver.  “To change lane s” means to move your car from one lane on a freeway or on a street to anothe r, but going in the same direction.  “To accelerate” means to drive faster, to increase your speed.  Then Cesar gives May some advice, “Just don’t forget to signal and don’t go over the speed limit.”  “To signal” (signal) here means to u se the lights of your car to indicate that you are going to move into another la ne or you are going to turn onto another street.  You have a right signal and a  left signal in most cars.  The “speed limit” is the maximum allowed speed on a roa d.  In the United States for a freeway in the city it’s usually 55 or 65 miles per  hour; out in the country, away from the big cities, it can be as high as 70 or 75 miles an hour.  The word “signal,” I should mention, has some other meanings  in English.  You can find those in the Learning Guide. 

May says, “Did you have to parallel park?”  “To par allel park” means to park your car between two other cars, where you have to back your car up – go in reverse in order to get into a parking space in between two  other cars.  That’s often a very difficult thing for a beginning driver to do.  May says, “That’s what I’m most worried about.”  Cesar says, “Yeah, I parallel park ed, but it was easy.  Why are you so worried about the test?”  May says, “I told you.  I haven’t had very much practice.”  Cesar says, “Exactly how many times hav e you been behind the wheel?”  That is, how many times have you been out driving?  May says, “Well, a few times…maybe two times, and that was around a pa rking lot,” a place where you park your car.  Cesar says, “Wow, you’d better get more practice if you’re going to take the test next week,” meaning you have  to go and drive more so that you are ready to take the driving test.  May says, “Could you…?”  She doesn’t finish her question, but she seems to be asking Ces ar if Cesar would take her out driving to give her some practice.  That, of course , is a difficult thing to do since the beginning driver doesn’t always know what they are doing and it can be a little dangerous for the person driving, as well as  you.  In the United States, if you pass the written test you can then practice behind the wheel with someone who  

has a driver’s license, who, the idea is will help you, tell you what to do and not to do.  Cesar says, “Uh, sorry, but I’ve got someplace  to be.”  The expression “I’ve got someplace to be” is a phrase you use to tell th e person that you are busy, you have another appointment, but you don’t give th em any details.  We often use this when we are lying and simply don’t want to  do what the other person is asking us to do.  You may say, for example, “Can yo u watch my dog and cat while I’m on vacation?” and I will say, “Oh, I’m so rry.  I’ve got someplace to be for the next two weeks.” 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
