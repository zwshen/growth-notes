This episode is a dialogue between Sonia and Paul a bout store promotions – things that stores give away in order to get custom ers. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Sonia: What is all this? 

Paul: These are entry forms and materials for our n ew store promotions and giveaways. 

Sonia: What prizes can people win? 

Paul: There are different kinds, because we’re runn ing several promotions at once. We have scratch-off cards to win instant priz es, including t-shirts.  

Sonia: Those t-shirts are really nice. I’d like one  of those. 

Paul: We also have a collect-and-win game. People c ollect codes printed on our products. When they’ve collected a certain number, they win gift certificates to spend in our store. 

Sonia: Wow, that’s great. I’d like a gift certifica te. 

Paul: We also have a sweepstake. Enter to win one o f three grand prizes: a TV, a Hawaiian vacation, and a brand new car! 

Sonia: Wow, I definitely want one of those.  

Paul: Do you know what you can do to win?  

 Sonia: No, what? 

Paul: Quit your job. The rules say that employees a nd their families are not eligible.  

Sonia: I don’t suppose I can find a way around that . 

Paul: Not unless you’re considering divorcing your husband or disowning your children.

Sonia begins our dialogue by asking Paul, “What is all this?” Notice, she says “all this” instead of just “this.” We would use that wor d “all” when someone has a lot of things and you are referring to a group of items , a group of things. Paul answers, “These are entry forms and the materials f or our new store promotions and giveaways.” Paul has more than one thing. He ha s several items.  

He has “entry forms.” An “entry (entry) form” is a piece of paper, usually, that you put your name and address on in order to participat e in some sort of contest or competition. Stores sometimes will have a contest in which they will “give away” – that is, they will give as a gift for free – something for people  who give the store their names and addresses. We have a very similar concept on th e Internet. Companies will give you something for free in exchange for your em ail address.  

Well, Paul is getting some entry forms and material s for their new store promotions and giveaways. A “giveaway” is when you give something to people for free, usually something that isn’t very expensi ve. It doesn’t cost a lot of money. A “promotion” is when you lower the price of  something you are selling in order to get more people to buy it. It’s basically a sale where you cut or lower the price of something so more people will buy it.  

Sonia says, “What prizes can people win?” A “prize”  (prize) is something that you win, usually in some contest or competition. Many s tates in the United States, including California, have what’s called a “lottery .” You buy a ticket, a piece of paper, for a dollar or two dollars, and you have a chance to win millions of dollars. The money that you win would be called the  “prize money.”  

Sonia wants to know what prizes people can win. Pau l says, “There are different kinds,” meaning there are different kinds of prizes , “because we’re running  

several promotions at once.” Notice he uses the ver b “to run” – “We’re running many,” or several, “promotions at once,” at the sam e time. You could say, “We are having different promotions,” but the verb “to run” is more often the case the one that we would use with this noun “promotions.”  

Paul then explains the games, the contests they’re going to have. He says, “We have scratch-off cards to win instant prizes, inclu ding t-shirts.” A “scratch (scratch) – off (off) card” is a piece of paper tha t has numbers on it usually, but the numbers are covered, and in order to find out w hat the numbers are, you have to use your finger or a small coin to rub off – or “scratch off” – the material that is covering the number. This is how you find o ut if you have won a prize – if you have the right numbers.  

“Instant” means immediately, right away. “Scratch-o ff cards” (they’re also called “scratchers”) are used for contests in which you wi n money or you win a prize immediately. You get your prize right after you scr atch off what’s covering up the numbers to see if you win. Sonia says, “Those t-shi rts are really nice. I’d like one of those.” Paul says, “We also have a collect-and-w in game.” A “collect-and-win game” is one in which you go around getting codes o r numbers from different packages, and once you have a certain number of the m, you can submit them or turn them in for a prize.  

The most common collect-and-win promotion that I re member, growing up anyway, was bottle caps. Coca-Cola and other sodas often came in glass bottles, and on the top of the bottle would be a covering – what we would call a “cap” (cap). Sometimes stores would have a promotion in w hich if you brought in, say, 25 or 50 of these caps, you would get a prize. That ’s an example of a “collect- and-win.” You go out and collect something, and the n you win a prize for turning in all of those things to the company, to the store .  

This of course encourages you to go out and buy mor e things that would have these numbers. That’s how the company sells more of  these things. Paul continues, “People collect codes printed on our pro ducts.” A “code” (code) is a series of letters and/or numbers that are used for some specific purpose. In this case, the company puts these codes on things that i t sells, and you can collect them in order to get a prize.  

I just thought of another collect-and-win promotion  that uses codes: Starbucks, the coffee company, sells coffee in the stores. You  can buy their coffee to make Starbucks coffee at home. When you buy a package of  their coffee, often it has a little sticker on it, a little piece of paper, the back of which has a code on it. And if  

you enter that code into the website, Starbucks wil l give you a free coffee if you enter enough of the codes into their website. I do this all the time, actually.  

Paul continues, “When they,” meaning the customers – “When they’ve collected a certain number, they win gift certificates to spe nd in our store.” A “gift certificate” is a piece of paper that a company giv es you that is worth a certain amount of money. Nowadays you don’t really see gift  certificates so often – usually what you get is what’s called a “gift card. ” The card has an electronic code on it, sort of like a credit card, that you ca n then use at a store just as if you were using money. There is “money on the card,” we might say.  

Sonia says, “Wow that’s great. I’d like a gift cert ificate.” Paul continues, “We also have a sweepstake.” A “sweepstake” – more often use d in the plural, “sweepstakes” – is a promotion in which people fill  out a form and give it to the company and then the company picks a winner. It’s b asically what we would call a “lottery” (lottery). Paul says, “Enter to win one  of three grand prizes: a TV, a Hawaiian vacation, and a brand new car!” Paul is sa ying that the prizes for the sweepstake are a television, a vacation in Hawaii, and a new car.  

Sonia says, “Wow, I definitely want one of those.” Paul says, “Do you know what you can do to win?” Sonia says, “No, what?” Paul sa ys jokingly, “Quit your job. The rules say that employees and their families are  not eligible.” The “rules,” or the regulations, say that “employees” – people who work for the company – “and their families are not eligible.” “To be eligible” (eligible) means that you have the qualifications to do something. You are allowed to participate in something.  

Well, Paul is saying that employees and their famil ies are not eligible. In other words, if you work for the company, you can’t enter  these games and win prizes. Sonia says, “I don’t suppose I can find a way aroun d that.” The expression “to find a way around” something means to figure out a way of not having to do something, of not having to follow the rules. We so metimes say, “There’s no way around it,” meaning there’s no way to avoid it. For  example, paying taxes in the United States if you work at a job – there’s no way  around it. The government won’t allow you to do it.  

Sonia says, “I don’t suppose,” meaning I don’t thin k, “I can find a way around that.” Paul says, “Not unless you’re considering di vorcing your husband or disowning your children.” We now understand that Pa ul and Sonia are married. That’s why Paul again says jokingly that the only w ay Sonia would be eligible would to no longer be his wife, to divorce him. “To  divorce” (divorce) in this case means to end a marriage. In order for Sonia not to be a member of Paul’s family, she would have to divorce him.   

 She might also have to disown her children.” “To di sown” (disown) means to no longer have a relationship with someone, especially  your children. If a father disowns his children, he’s saying to his children, “I don’t want anything to do with you anymore.” This is a verb we often use when some one dies – a parent dies and doesn’t leave his or her children any money. If  you disown your children, when you die, your “will,” your legal document that  says what happens to your things when you die, says that your children won’t get any money.  

Fortunately, my parents never disowned me, but sinc e there are ten other siblings in my family – I have ten brothers and sis ters – I probably won’t get very much money anyway.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
