On this episode, we’re going to have a dialogue bet ween Asa and Elizabeth about drinking things that don’t have alcohol in th em. Sounds a little boring, but let’s get started anyway.

[start of dialogue]

Asa: What can I get you to drink?

Elizabeth: I’ll have a glass of water, thanks.

Asa: Are you sure you don’t want something else? I have soft drinks, orange juice, lemonade, and fruit punch.

Elizabeth: No, thanks. I’m trying to cut back on my  sugar intake.

Asa: In that case, how about an energy drink, sport s drink, or bottled tea?

Elizabeth: No, really, I’m fine with water.

Asa: Ah, I bet you’d like some tea or coffee, right ?

Elizabeth: No, all I want is a glass of water.

Asa: Okay, do you want tap water or bottled water, flavored water or carbonated?

Elizabeth: Do you mean to tell me you have all of t hose drinks in your refrigerator?

Asa: It pays to own a beverage company.

Asa begins our dialogue by saying to Elizabeth, “What can I get you to drink?” Asa is offering to get something for Elizabeth to d rink. Elizabeth says, “I’ll have a glass of water, thanks.” Asa says, “Are you sure yo u don’t want something else?” He then lists, or gives a list of, the other things  he can get for Elizabeth.

He says, “I have soft drinks, orange juice, lemonad e and fruit punch.” A “soft (soft) drink” is also called a “soda.” In some part s of the country it’s called “soda pop” (pop). Or if you’re from Minnesota, it’s calle d simply “pop.” Soft drinks are typically “carbonated beverages,” or things you dri nk. “Carbonated” just means it has little bubbles in it. Things like Coca-Cola and  7 Up are “soft drinks.”

Asa says he has soft drinks. He also has “orange ju ice,” which is obviously the liquid made by squeezing an orange. The word “juice ” (juice) usually refers to the liquid that you get from a fruit. Asa also has “lem onade” (lemonade). “Lemonade” is made with lemon juice, but you put a little bit of lemon juice into a lot of water. Lemon juice itself is a little strong to drink with out mixing it in with water, whereas orange juice can be drunk just as it is. In fact, y ou don’t want to mix orange juice in with water. It’s not strong enough.

Finally, Asa says he has “fruit punch” (punch). Fru it punch is made by mixing in the juices of several different types of fruit, oft en combined with sugar. Elizabeth says, “No, thanks. I’m trying to cut back on my sug ar intake.” “To cut back on” something is to reduce the amount of something, to have less of something. Someone may say, “I’m trying to cut back on coffee”  – that means he’s still drinking coffee but he’s trying to drink less coffe e than he did before.

Elizabeth is “cutting back on her sugar intake” (in take). “Intake” is the amount of something you eat or drink, usually. So, your “suga r intake” would be the amount of sugar that you eat or drink. Asa says, “In that case,” meaning since you are trying to cut back on your sugar intake, “how about  an energy drink, sports drink, or bottled tea?” Interestingly enough, all three of  these things can also have sugar in them.

Let’s start with the first one, which is “energy (e nergy) drink.” An energy drink is a drink that is supposed to, well, give you more ener gy so that you can get up and do something. These are drinks that often contain a  lot of caffeine, but they often also contain a lot of sugar.

“Sports drinks” are drinks designed for people who are exercising or participating in some sort of athletic event. A sports drink ofte n contains things that will help replace sodium, potassium, and other what are calle d “electrolytes” that you may lose by “sweating” – that is, when water comes out of your skin because you are working so hard at the physical activity.

“Bottled tea” is, well, just what it sounds like – tea that is put into a bottle and sold. It’s not the kind of tea that you make by boi ling hot water and mixing with tea leaves. Bottled tea is something you can buy in  a store and is usually drunk cold. Again, a lot of bottled tea also has sugar in  it.

Elizabeth says, “No, really. I’m fine with water.” To say you’re “fine with” something means you’re okay with this. You don’t ne ed anything else. Asa says, “Ah, I bet you’d like some tea or coffee, right?” “ I bet” means I’m guessing. “I bet you’d like some tea or coffee,” Asa says. Tea, of c ourse, is a hot drink made by placing hot water into a cup with tea leaves in it or another container that has tea leaves in it.

Coffee is a hot drink that was invented by God so t hat we would be able to function properly in the morning – we would be able  to get up and do our work properly in the morning. I have coffee every day. C offee is made from coffee beans which are crushed or ground up before hot wat er is poured through them.

Elizabeth says, “No, all I want is a glass of water .” Asa says, “Okay, do you want tap water or bottled water, flavored water or carbo nated?” Water that comes from your kitchen sink is called “tap (tap) water.” In o rder to get water out of the sink in your kitchen or in your bathroom, you have to turn the tap so that the water can come out of the pipe. You open the tap and you clos e the tap. “Tap water,” then, is water that you just get from whatever water syst em your house or building is connected to.

In most big cities in the United States, the city g overnment controls the water, and there are water pipes that go to every house. T hat’s “tap water.” Now, the water that is provided by the government sometimes isn’t very good in terms of the taste. So, some people prefer to get “bottled w ater” – water that you buy at a store that has been specially cleaned or filtered.

“Flavored water” is water that has some sort of add ed fruit or other vegetable flavor to it. This has become quite popular in the U.S. in the last few years, especially at certain cafes and restaurants. They w ill put fruit into the water. Like, oh, I don’t know, strawberries, for example, or veg etables such as cucumbers. They put that into the water and it tastes, well, l ike strawberries or cucumbers.

 I really don’t like flavored water, myself. I don’t  know why they do that. Perhaps because the tap water tastes so bad, instead of fil tering it or getting bottled water they put some sort of fruit or vegetable into it. P ersonally I think it’s disgusting, but some people like it. Asa is offering Elizabeth some flavored water or carbonated water. “Carbonated water” is water with dissolved “carbon dioxide” in it, which causes it to have little bubbles just lik e soda.

Elizabeth says, “Do you mean to tell me you have al l of those drinks in your refrigerator?” The question form “Do you mean to te ll me” is used when you don’t believe what the other person is saying and you wan t to make sure that you understand him correctly. That’s why Elizabeth uses  it here. She is surprised that Asa has all of these different kinds of drinks in h is refrigerator.

“Do you mean to tell me you have all of those drink s in your refrigerator?” she asks. He says, “It pays to own a beverage company.”  “Beverages” (beverages) are drinks. Any kind of drink can be called a “beve rage.” We find out that Asa “owns” – is the owner of – a company that makes the se different beverages. That’s why he says, “It pays (pays) to own a bevera ge company.”

“It pays to” means it is beneficial to or there are  advantages to doing or having something. This is actually a quite useful expressi on. “It pays to study before a test.” That means it will be to your benefit. It wi ll be advantageous for you to study before you go and take a test; or, “It pays t o prepare yourself for an interview.” It will be good for you. It will benefi t you if you do that.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
