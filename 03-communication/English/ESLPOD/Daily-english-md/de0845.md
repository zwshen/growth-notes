This episode is a dialog between Aaron and Margo ab out leaving college before you are finished. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialog] 

Aaron:  Mom, I have something to tell you and you’r e not going to like it. 

Margo:  What is it? 

Aaron:  I’m dropping out of college. I want to get out into the real world and get a job. I’m wasting time in school. 

Margo:  You’ll get a better job if you stay in scho ol and graduate with a degree. You’ll have more earning power and better long-term  prospects. 

Aaron:  I’m sick of school. All of my friends are e arning money, buying cars, and living life. I feel like life is passing me by.   

Margo:  Your friends didn’t go to college and got a  job right out of high school.   

Aaron:  That’s right. There’s nothing wrong with th at. 

Margo:  No, there isn’t. And right now, they seem t o be living the high life. They don’t have any responsibilities and can blow their paychecks on having fun. Once they have a family, their paychecks won’t stretch v ery far. With a degree, you’ll out-earn them right out of the gate when you gradua te in two years. 

Aaron:  I don’t want to wait. 

Margo:  This is all about delayed gratification. A little suffering now will pay off in the long run. Trust me. Two more years and you’ll b e done. 

Aaron:  Yeah, maybe I can stick it out for two more  years and then no more school – ever! 

Margo:  Unless you decide to go to graduate school. .. 

Aaron:  Mom, don’t push it. 

[end of dialog] 

Aaron says to Margo, who we find out is his mother,  “Mom, I have something to tell you and you’re not going to like it.” This, of  course, is the worst way to begin any conversation. “I have something to tell you and  you’re not going to like what I have to tell you.” Margo says – Aaron’s mom – “What  is it?”  

Aaron says, “I’m dropping out of college.” “To drop  out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop going to school before you hav e completed your education, before you have received your degree or certificate . You can drop out of high school. We have many young people who stop going to  high school after they turn 16 years old. In the United States, in most st ates, you can leave high school when you turn 16, even though you haven’t completed  your high school diploma or certificate. The normal age is 18 to complete hi gh school – 17 or 18. It is possible to stop going to school before that. That’ s what we call “dropping out.” You can also drop out of college, leave college bef ore you finish your degree. That’s what Aaron wants to do.  

He says, “I want to get out into” – or to go into –  “the real world and get a job.” When people say “the real world,” they mean not ins ide of a school, to be out where people are working, doing things like making money. Aaron says, “I’m wasting time in school.” “To waste time” means you aren’t doing anything very useful or productive. Margo says, “You’ll get a bet ter job if you stay in school and graduate with a degree.” Margo is trying to convinc e her son that if he wants to get a good job, he should stay in school and gradua te. “To graduate” means to complete your program. I graduated from high school  in 1981. That’s when I completed my high school degree – my high school “d iploma”, we would call it. “Degree” is usually a word we use when you finish s ome sort of college program. You can have an undergraduate degree, what we call a “Bachelor’s degree,” or you could have a “graduate degree,” such as a Maste r’s or a doctorate.  

Margo says, “You’ll have more earning power and bet ter long term prospects.” Margo was saying to Aaron: If you graduate with a d egree, you’ll have more “earning power.” “Earning” (earning) refers to gett ing money by working. “Earning power” is the ability to make a lot of money from y our work. “Long-term” means for a very long time. “Prospects” (prospects) refer  to opportunities. So, “long-term prospects” are your opportunities for the future, f or many years into the future.  

Aaron says, however, “I’m sick of school” I’m tired  of school. “All of my friends are earning money, buying cars, and living life” – living a normal life. “I feel like life is passing me by.” The expression, “life is pa ssing me by,” or passing someone by, means that you feel that your life is v ery boring, that you’re getting older but you’re not getting more out of life. You’ re not enjoying life the way other people enjoy life. That’s the meaning of the expres sion “Life is passing me by.”  

Margo says, “Your friends didn’t go to college and got a job right out of high school,” meaning immediately after they finished hi gh school. Aaron says, “That’s right” – that’s correct. “There is nothing wrong wi th that,” meaning that’s okay. Margo says, “No. There isn’t.” She’s agreeing with Aaron that there isn’t anything wrong with getting a job when you graduate from hig h school and not going to college.  

However, she’s also reminding Aaron that in the fut ure he will be better off than his friends. He will have a better job than his fri ends because he did wait to get a job and go to college instead. Margo says, “Right n ow” – at this moment – “your friends seem to be living the high life.” The “high  (high) life” is a relaxed, comfortable, exciting life, spending a lot of money  on your own comfort, your own entertainment, a good life. And that’s what Margo i s saying that Aaron’s friends are doing right now. “They’re living the high life.  They don’t have any responsibilities and can blow their paychecks on ha ving fun.” “To blow (blow) your money on something” means to spend it on somet hing that isn’t very important, or to waste your money on something that  isn’t very useful. I’m going to go to Vegas and gamble. I’m going to go to Las V egas and play cards and gamble a million dollars. I’m going to blow a milli on dollars. Well, I don’t have a million dollars but it’s just an example. “To blow it” means to waste it – to lose it, in this case. 

Margo says that Aaron’s friends can blow their payc hecks on having fun. Your “paycheck” is the money you receive for working at your job. Margo says, “Once they have a family” – once they get married and hav e children – “their paychecks won’t stretch very far.” “To not stretch (stretch) very far” means they won’t be able to pay for everything they want and need becau se they won’t have enough money. So, if you only have to worry about yourself , you may be able to buy  

whatever you want. But when you get married and hav e a family and have children, well then, your money will not stretch ve ry far. You will have less money to spend because you have more things to buy.  

Margo says, “With a degree” – with a college degree  – “you’ll out-earn them” – your friends – “right out of the gate when you grad uate in two years.” “To out- earn” means to earn more than, to get more money at  a job than the other people. To “out-“ anything means to do more of that . You can out-perform. You can out-sing. You could out-swim, meaning you would  perform better. You would sing better. You would swim better than the other p eople. “Right out of the gate” (gate) means immediately. As soon as you graduate, right out of the gate, you will start to make more money than your friends.  

Aaron says, “I don’t want to wait.” This, of course , is the problem of many young people. They do not understand that you need to wai t in order to good things in life if you spend time wisely. But they don’t want to wait. Margo says, “This is all about delayed gratification.” “Gratification” is ge tting good things in your life. “To delay” (delay) means to wait. So, “delayed gratific ation” is waiting for the good things. Many people can’t delay their gratification . They want gratification right now. And so, instead of going to college and gettin g a degree, they want to go out and get a job right away, or when they get mone y, the first thing they do is they spend their money, even though they should, pe rhaps, wait, save their money and buy something in the future instead. Marg o says, “A little suffering” – a little pain – “now, will pay off in the long run. ” “To pay off” means to be worthwhile, to have benefits. The “long run” means in the future, in the long term, which is an expression we used earlier.  

Aaron’s mom says, “Trust me, two more years and you ’ll be done.” Aaron says, “Yeah, maybe I can stick it out for two more years. ” “To stick it out” means to wait, to delay. “And then no more school, ever.” Ma rgo says, “Unless you decide to go to graduate school.” “Graduate school” is whe re you go after you finish your Bachelor’s, if you want a Master’s or a doctorate i n something.  

Aaron says, “Mom, don’t push it.” The expression “D on’t push it!” means stop right there. Don’t try to get a better deal or don’ t try to get even more out of this negotiation or this conversation. We often use the expression jokingly, humorously – “Don’t push it.” So, for example, your  daughter asks you if she can use your car to go to a movie. And you say, “Okay, fine.” And then she says, “Oh, and can you also pay for the movie?” You say to her , “Don’t push it,” meaning you’ve already gotten something good, don’t ask for  more.  

Now let’s listen to the dialog this time at a norma l speed.
