Evan: How many guys are you juggling?

Chantelle: Not that many, only the ones who are rea lly devoted admirers. I try to throw them a bone now and then.

This episode is all about bragging. “To brag” (brag ) means to talk about how good you are at something, to tell other people how  great you are. In this episode, Chantelle is bragging about her success wi th men.

Evan begins our dialogue by asking her, “Who are yo u going out with tonight?” “To go out with” someone here means to go to some s ocial event such as a dinner or a movie or some party. “I’m going out wit h my friends” means I’m going to have a good time tonight doing something with my  friends. “To go out with” can also mean to be in a romantic relationship with  someone. “I’m going out with a girl I met at work last week.” Here, however, it just means to be with someone to have a good time.

Chantelle isn’t sure who she’s going out with tonig ht. She says, “I might go to dinner with Steve or Eduardo or Jim.” Evan says, “D inner is in a couple of hours,” meaning we are very close to the time when you woul d be going to dinner. “You mean they’re waiting around for your call?” “To wai t (wait) around” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to wait for something to happe n, usually because you don’t have any other plans. “I’m waiting around for my fr iend to call.” I’m sitting here doing nothing else, really, because I don’t have an ything important to do other than wait for him to call me.

These men that Chantelle is interested in are waiti ng around for her to call. Chantelle says, “They’d better be,” meaning she exp ects them to be waiting around for her call. She continues, “They’re the on es vying for my attention, so they’d better be at my beck and call.” “To vie (vie ) for someone’s attention” means to try to get someone to pay attention to you , to try to get someone to notice you. Chantelle says that these three men are  “vying for her attention.” They want her to notice them.

Therefore, she says, “they’d better be at my beck ( beck) and call.” “To be at someone’s beck and call” means to be ready and will ing to do whatever someone asks you to do or wants you to do. Rich peo ple often have servants who are at their “beck and call.” The servants work  for them and do whatever they tell them to do. Chantelle thinks these men sh ould be at her beck and call, sort of like servants, I guess.

 Evan says, “How many guys are you juggling?” “To ju ggle” (juggle) here means to try to do many different things at the same time . Another meaning of “to juggle” is to take objects such as small balls and throw th em up in the air and keep them up in the air at the same time. Some people are abl e to juggle three, four, or five tennis balls at the same time, keeping them all up in the air. Here the verb is used, however, to mean to be able to do a lot of di fferent things at the same time.

In Chantelle’s case, she’s talking about the number  of different men who are interested in her and to whom she is thinking of pa ying attention. Chantelle says, “Not that many, only the ones who are really devote d admirers.” If someone is “devoted” (devoted) to something or to someone, he is interested in that thing or person and will spend a lot of time on it – or her,  in this case. An “admirer” (admirer) is someone who likes another person, in t his case in a romantic way. So Chantelle’s devoted admirers are men who are ver y interested in having a romantic relationship with her.

Chantelle continues, “I try to throw them a bone no w and then.” The expression “to throw someone a bone” (bone) means to give some one a small amount of what he or she wants or is asking for, but not what  they completely want or not everything that they want. The expression relates to what you would do for a dog for example. You may be eating a nice juicy steak a nd the dog wants the steak. Well, you don’t give the dog the steak, the meat, b ut you might throw the dog the bone from the steak. It’s a small amount of what the dog likes.

“To throw someone a bone,” then, means to give him a little of what he wants so that he continues to be interested, but not everyth ing he wants. Chantelle says she likes “to keep” these men “on their toes.” “To keep someone on their toes” (toes) means to make someone pay attention, to keep  someone ready for something that might happen, something important th at might happen. “To keep someone on his toes” means to keep him focused, to keep him concentrated. Chantelle wants the men to be kept on their toes, m eaning they have to be ready to do what she says she wants them to do.

Evan says, “And by making them jealous of each othe r?” “To be jealous” (jealous) means to want what another person has. In  this case, “to be jealous” refers to the men each wanting what he thinks the o ther has, the attention of Chantelle. Evan says, “I saw how angry Jack got whe n he saw you flirting with Kwan and later getting cozy with Mike.” Men, as wel l as women, are sometimes jealous if the person whom they are attracted to or  are in love with shows attention to another person.

Chantelle was “flirting” with Kwan. “To flirt” (fli rt) means to show some sort of romantic interest in another person by what you say  or by what you do in a playful way, without any real seriousness perhaps b ehind it. Chantelle was “flirting with Kwan” and later “getting cozy with M ike,” another man. “To get cozy (cozy) with” someone means to be very close physica lly to that person, perhaps touching that person or putting your arm around tha t person or kissing that person.

Evan describes a situation in which Chantelle was w ith one man, Jack, but she was also flirting with Kwan and getting cozy with a  third man, Mike. This made Jack, understandably, angry. Chantelle says, howeve r, “Jack can’t stay angry with me,” meaning he won’t continue to be angry for  a long time. “We’ll kiss and make up,” she says. The expression “to kiss and mak e up means” to end an argument, especially between a romantic couple.

Then Evan asks her, “Don’t you ever get tired of to ying with so many men?” “To toy (toy) with” someone is to treat someone in a wa y that isn’t serious – in this case, to act as though you are romantically interes ted in someone when in fact you really aren’t. You’re playing with them. You’re  toying with them. That’s what Evan is accusing Chantelle of doing.

Chantelle disagrees. She says, “I’m not toying with  them. It’s not my fault,” meaning I am not to blame, “that men find me irresi stible.” “To be irresistible” (irresistible) means it is impossible to say no to something or to someone. In this case, it means that she is very, very beautiful, ve ry attractive, such that men cannot resist her. They can’t say no to her. Evan s ays, “Right, just like moths to a flame.” “Moths” (moths) are small flying insects th at have large wings – the things they move up and down to fly – that typically are f ound at night. They’re sort of like a butterfly but are usually white or gray.

Moths are attracted to sources of light. One source  of light is a “flame” (flame). A “flame” is what you get when you have a fire. The “ flames” of a fire are what you can see of the fire – that which is burning produce s heat and light. A moth is often attracted to light, and so may actually go in to a flame, and of course doing that will kill the moth. When a moth flies into a f ire or a flame, it gets burned. “To get burned,” means in one sense to have the fire ha rm the insect.

You can get burned if you put your hand into a fire , but here the expression has two meanings. It means literally the moths flying i nto the flame and being burned, but “to get burned” is also used as an expression in a romantic relationship – or perhaps in any relationship, really – where one per son does something to harm

another person or another person gets harmed becaus e of the actions of the other.

In the case of Chantelle, the men are all intereste d in her and are attracted to her like moths to a flame, but also like moths to a fla me, they will get hurt by this attraction. All of us probably have gotten burned a t some point or another in our lives, especially if you vie for the attention of s omeone whom other people are also attracted to. There will be one winner and man y losers. That’s the way the world is, isn’t it?

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
