This episode is a dialogue between Paula and Marcus  about taking drugs – medicine that the doctor has given you to take. Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paula: Okay, I’m off to bed.

Marcus: Wait a second. Where are you going with all  of those pill bottles?

Paula: My doctor prescribed a couple of medications  to help me sleep.

Marcus: Let me see those. You have four different m edications here. This is a painkiller, this is a sedative, this is a tranquili zer, and this is a stimulant.

Paula: I don’t take that last one when I go to bed.

Marcus: You mean you take the first three every nig ht?

Paula: Not every night.

Marcus: I can’t believe that your doctor would pres cribe all three of these medications just to help you sleep. This seems like  overkill.

Paula: I saw more than one doctor. They each gave m e a different prescription.

Marcus: How do you know they won’t interact and pro duce side effects?

Paula: A doctor prescribed each one. I’m sure they’ re safe.

Marcus: Yes, but does the left hand know what the r ight hand is doing? I’m confiscating these until you can talk to a doctor o r pharmacist to make sure you won’t overdose by taking all three of these at one time.

Paula: But how will I fall asleep until then?

Marcus: You’re always telling me how boring I am. I ’ll just regale you with stories of my youth. Let’s start at the beginning. My earli est memory is . . .

Paula begins our dialogue by saying to Marcus, “Oka y, I’m off to bed,” meaning I’m going to go to sleep now. Marcus says, “Wait a second” – wait. “Where are you going with all of those pill bottles?” A “pill”  (pill) is usually a small, often round object that is, in fact, medicine that you put in y our mouth and swallow. That’s one of the most common ways of taking medicine. A “ pill bottle,” then, would be a small bottle in which you keep your pills.

Paula says, “My doctor prescribed a couple of medic ations to help me sleep.” “To prescribe” (prescribe) is to write down a type of m edication that a person should take. Doctors prescribe drugs. In fact, in the Unit ed States, only licensed doctors can prescribe drugs. There are certain kinds of dru gs that you could only get if a doctor says it’s okay. These are called “prescripti on drugs.” “Prescription” comes from the verb “to prescribe.”

We also use this word “to prescribe” more generally , when people are talking about giving advice or recommendations to someone. “I prescribe three days of rest for you.” It’s as though you were a doctor and  you were giving someone a prescription. You were telling them something that would be good for them to do. Paula’s doctor “prescribed a couple of medications”  for her. “Medications” refers to drugs, medicine – in this case, pills. “Medicati on” is a general word for drugs that you are given to make you well.

Marcus says, “Let me see those. You have four diffe rent medications here. This as a pain killer, this is a sedative, this is a tra nquilizer, and this is a stimulant.” There are four different kinds of drugs mentioned h ere. The first is a “painkiller” (painkiller) – one word. A painkiller is a medicine  that, you can guess, helps reduce pain. Aspirin would be a painkiller. Codeine  would be a painkiller. A “sedative” (sedative) is a medicine that calms you down. It calms you down in order to make you sleep. A sedative makes you sleep y.

A “tranquilizer” (tranquilizer) is a medicine that makes you feel calmer. It’s a medicine that is given to reduce your anxiety, to make you less worried. Tranquilizers are also used with animals to make th em less aggressive, to quiet them down, to calm them down. My neighbor’s dog, for example, when he’s barking a little bit too much and my neighbors aren ’t home, I give him a little tranquilizer. It keeps him calm. You know what I’m saying?

A “stimulant” (stimulant) is a drug that gives you more energy, that gets you more excited. One of the most common substances that we take in the United States as a stimulant would be coffee, caffeinated coffee,  because “caffeine,” which is a substance in coffee, is a stimulant. It gets you mo re excited. So, people often have coffee, like I do, in the morning to wake them  up. Paula says, “I don’t take that last one when I go to bed.” She’s saying she d oesn’t take a stimulant when she’s going to bed because, of course, she wants to  fall asleep, not wake up. Marcus says, “You mean you take the first three eve ry night?” That is, the painkiller, the sedative, and the tranquilizer. Pau la says, “Not every night.”

Marcus says, “I can’t believe that your doctor woul d prescribe all three of these medications just to help you sleep.” Marcus doesn’t  understand why the doctor would give her three medicines to help her sleep. H e says, “This seems like overkill.” “Overkill” (overkill) is too much of som ething. For example, if you are a man and you are going out on your first date with a  woman, it would be overkill to buy her roses, buy her a new car, buy her dinner, a nd propose to marry her. That would be way too much. You would probably scare her  away. So, guys, don’t do that. That’s an example of overkill.

Paula says, “I saw more than one doctor.” Now we un derstand how Paula got all these different prescriptions. She saw different do ctors. Paula says, “They each gave me a different prescription” – each doctor. Ma rcus says, “How do you know they won’t interact and produce side effects?” When  we talk about drugs “interacting,” we’re referring to how the two thing s will work together. Sometimes drugs will give you worse problems if you take them  together. That’s why you need to tell your doctor all the different drugs yo u are taking if you are seeing more than one doctor, as is the case with Paula.

“Side effects” are other things that the drug does to your body that isn’t supposed to help you, but that sometimes can’t be avoided. S o, for example, when people take certain drugs for their allergies, the drugs make them sleepy. This is a side effect. That’s not the reason you’re taking the dru g. You’re taking the drug because of your allergies. But in addition, the dru g may also have this side effect of making you sleepy. I’ve had a few parents email me to tell me that my podcast in English makes their children sleepy, even though  the children don’t understand

English. So, I guess I could be considered a tranqu ilizer. My wife certainly thinks so whenever I talk to her.

Paula says, “A doctor prescribed each one. I’m sure  they are safe.” Paula thinks the drugs are safe because she got them from doctor s, even though she got them from different doctors and didn’t tell the doc tors that she was getting these different drugs. Marcus says, “Yes” – meaning yes, they were prescri bed by doctors – “but does the left hand know what the right hand is doing?”

This is an old expression meaning that one person i s doing something, and another person is doing something else, and neither  one knows what the other one is doing, so you could have some unexpected con sequences – something bad could go wrong. The left hand has to know what the right hand is doing in an organization or any group. Everyone has to know wha t everyone else is doing, typically, otherwise you may cause problems for you rself.

Marcus says, “I’m confiscating these until you can talk to a doctor or pharmacist to make sure you don’t overdose by taking all three  of these at one time.” Marcus is saying that he is going to “confiscate” (confisc ate) these drugs. “To confiscate” something means to take something away from someone  without the person’s permission. Usually, someone in authority can confi scate something from another person.

A teacher in a high school classroom might confisca te a student’s cell phone if the student is talking during class, or texting, or  tweeting, or Instagramming, or whatever it is that high school students do nowadays. That is an example of the verb “confiscate.” The police might confiscate drug s from your car if they find them there. So, don’t put them in your car.

Marcus says he is going to confiscate these drugs f rom Paula until Paula “can talk to a doctor or pharmacist.” A “pharmacist” (ph armacist) is someone who prepares medicines, prepares drugs to give to peopl e who have a prescription, who have permission from their doctors. A pharmacis t used to be called a “druggist,” although we don’t use that term in the United States very much anymore.

“Overdose” (overdose) is when someone takes too muc h of a drug and dies, often because of taking too much of the drug. An ov erdose doesn’t necessarily kill you, but it can kill you, and it can be very d angerous if you take too many of a certain kind of drug or medicine. Unhappily, some f amous celebrities here in Los Angeles sometimes overdose on illegal drugs.

 Marcus doesn’t want Paula to overdose on these lega l prescription drugs. Paula says, “But how will I fall asleep until then?” She’ s wondering how she is going to be able to fall asleep from now until when she has the opportunity to talk to a pharmacist or doctor. Marcus says, “You’re always t elling me how boring I am. I’ll just regale you with stories of my youth.” “To rega le” (regale) here means to tell stories to someone in a funny and interesting way, or to provide some sort of amusement to someone by talking to them.

Marcus is joking, of course. He’s saying that Paula  thinks he’s boring, so he’ll just tell Paula some stories about his youth. Your “yout h” (youth) is the years when you were growing up as a child. Marcus says, “Let’s  start at the beginning. My earliest memory is . . .” And then he, of course, s tarts telling Paula stories that are so boring that she will fall asleep. Pretty muc h what happens to my wife.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
