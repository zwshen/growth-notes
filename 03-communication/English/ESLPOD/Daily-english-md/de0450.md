[start of dialogue]

Lance:  Did you see Kim at the party last Saturday?

Paulina:  Yeah, I saw her.  Why?

Lance:  She was wearing a skimpy dress and all of the men were leering at her all night.  I used to think she was a nice girl.  Isn’t  she worried that she’ll get a reputation?

Paulina:  A reputation for what?

Lance:  For being…you know.

Paulina:  No, I don’t know.

Lance:  For being easy!  It doesn’t take much for people  to jump to the wrong conclusions when a woman is dressed like that.

Paulina:  So based on one dress she wore to a party, yo u’re ready to consider her promiscuous.

Lance:  No, not just based on that.  The guys at the par ty were talking and one of them said he used to date her, and he said…

 Paulina:  Now you’re listening to some sleazy guy at a par ty boasting about his conquest.  The question is, why are you so ready to give cre dibility to rumors like that?

Lance:  Whoa, don’t go ballistic on me.  I was only tell ing you what I heard.  I thought you might be interested.

Paulina:  Well, you thought wrong.  I used to think th at women were catty, but you men are much, much worse!

Our dialogue begins with Lance saying to Paulina, “Did  you see Kim at the party last Saturday?”  Paulina said, “Yeah, I saw her.  Why?”   Lance says, “She was wearing a skimpy dress.”  “Skimpy” (skimpy) usually means that yo u are wearing clothing that does not cover very much of your body; letting  other people see a lot of your skin.  This is often a term used to describe wo men’s clothing that does not cover up a great deal of the body.  For example, yo u could say that a dress was skimpy or that an outfit (a set of clothing) was skimpy.  Usually we use this word when the amount of clothing that the person is we aring isn’t appropriate for the occasion.  So if you go to a formal dinner and you w ear, for example, a bikini top, if you’re a man that’s a little strange; if you’re  a woman that would probably be considered a little skimpy, not enough clothing.

Lance says that Kim was wearing a skimpy dress and all of the  men were leering at her.  To “leer” (leer) means to look at someone in  a sexual way.  It’s a negative term to describe the way a man might look at a woman, f or example; it’s not something that a woman would like.  She may say, “Stop leering at me” – stop looking at me in a sexual way.

Lance said, “I used to think she was a nice girl.”  Here, “nice girl” would refer to a young, unmarried women who does everything right, who d oesn’t date a lot of men.  Lance said, “Isn’t she worried that she’ll get a r eputation?”  “Reputation” is a general term to refer to how people think of you – what people think of you. However, if someone says, “he has a reputation,” usually t hey mean he or she has a bad reputation.  For a woman to have a reputati on is to have people think that you are sexually active with many different men, for example, or that you are too sexual.

Paulina says, “A reputation for what?”  Lance says, “For b eing…you know.” Paulina says, “No, I don’t know.”  Lance doesn’t want t o say it directly.  Finally he says, “For being easy!”  “Easy” is a term used to describe a w oman who has sex

 with other men usually soon after she meets them, a wo man who may have many sexual partners.  Once again, it’s usually a negative o r insulting term.  The word “easy” has several meanings in English; take a look at  our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lance says, “It doesn’t take much for people to jump to the wrong conclusions when a woman is dressed like that.”  The expression “to ju mp to the wrong conclusions” means to decide something quickly without necessar ily thinking it through, without looking at all of the evidence, to fo rm a quick and often incorrect opinion about something.  Just looking at someone and ho w they are dressed and deciding what that person is like may be jumping to the wrong conclusion, you are reasoning incorrectly.

Paulina says, “So based on (or because of) one dress she w ore to a party, you’re ready to consider her (Kim) promiscuous.”  “Promiscuous” i s similar to “easy,” it’s someone who has sexual relations with many different peo ple.  Lance says, “No, not just based on that,” that is, not just with that i nformation or because of that information.  Lance says, “The guys at the party were talki ng and one of them said he used to date her, and he said…”  Paulina inter rupts and says, “Now you’re listening to some sleazy guy at a party boasting abou t his conquest.”  To describe someone as “sleazy” means that you are saying that pe rson is immoral or unethical, someone who is not very nice.  It’s a very neg ative way to describe someone.

Paulina says that Lance is listening to some sleazy guy at a party boasting about his conquest.  To “boast” (boast) means to talk about somet hing that you have done so that other people will be envious of you or wi ll think highly of you.  To boast is normally not a good thing, to go around and t ell everyone how good you are, how great you are.  Another word for “to boast” is “to brag” (brag).  So, Paulina is saying that this person – this man, this sleazy gu y, was boasting about his conquest.  To have a “conquest” means to win, to have s ome victory.  Here, it refers to having a sexual relationship another person.  If a man talks about his conquests, he may be talking about women that he has had sexual relations with. Paulina says, “The question is, why are you so ready to gi ve credibility to rumors like that?”  “Credibility” means deserving to be trusted or to be believed in, believability.  If someone lies a lot, you could say that person doesn’t have very much credibility; when they speak no one believes them.  “ Rumors” are information that people tell each other usually about some secret, and often these are things that are not true.

So, Lance is giving credibility – believing in rumors tha t he heard at this party. Lance says, “Whoa (meaning “wait a minute”), don’t go b allistic on me.”  The

 expression “to go ballistic” (ballistic) means to get very an gry, to get very mad at someone very quickly, and perhaps unexpectedly.  The person  wasn’t expecting you to get so angry so quickly.  Lance says, “I was only telling  you what I heard. I thought you might be interested.”  Paulina says, “Well , you thought wrong.” That’s a common expression.  When someone says, “Well, I tho ught that (something something)” (that is, they are thinking somet hing that the other person knows is wrong), the other person may say, “You thou ght wrong,” meaning you are incorrect.  It’s not a nice way to express  your opinion, but it is a very direct way.  Paulina says, “You thought wrong.  I use d to think that women were catty, but you men are much, much worse!”  To be “ca tty” (catty) means to say that someone else is mean or to say bad things about som eone when they are not present (when they are not with you).

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
