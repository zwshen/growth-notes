[start of dialogue]

Roberto: All right, let’s get started. I organized this faculty and staff meeting to talk about ideas to improve school security.

Ginny: But we already have controlled access to sch ool buildings, and all of the staff and faculty wear ID badges.

Roberto: Those measures help to keep people out of our school who don’t belong here. But in light of what’s happened at oth er schools, we need to do more to keep students safe.

Ginny: You mean in the event of bomb threats and ma ss shootings?

Roberto: Those are some of the threats we have to p repare for.

Ginny: I don’t know how we can prepare for those th ings.

Roberto: Well, we might consider security cameras a nd armed guards to patrol the school.

Ginny: Really?

Roberto: Really. We need to develop evacuation plan s or procedures for lockdown in the event of an imminent threat.

Ginny: This is scary stuff.

 Roberto: We live in scary times.

Ginny: It’s starting to feel like we work in a pris on, not a school!

Roberto begins by saying, “All right, let’s get sta rted.” Roberto is talking to a group of people and he wants to start the meeting t hat they are having. He explains, “I organized” – or “I planned” – “this fa culty and staff meeting to talk about ideas to improve school security.” The word “ faculty” (faculty) refers to the teachers at a school. It could be a high school. It  could be a college. I think of the word usually being associated with colleges, but hi gh schools and other schools for children also sometimes use this word to descri be the entire group of teachers at that school.

“Staff” (staff) can refer to anyone who works at a company or in an organization. In the case of schools, “staff” could refer to the teachers, but here it refers to everyone who works at the school who is not a teach er. That would include the janitors, the people in the kitchen, the administra tors – that is, the principal and other leaders of the school –and so forth.

The meeting Roberto organized is all about “school security” (security). The word “security” can refer to a couple of different thing s. Here it refers to keeping people at the school safe. “School security” would be keep ing the faculty, staff, and students safe so that there are no injuries, and mo re importantly that no one gets killed. Sadly, in the past several decades, there h ave been several cases where people have died at schools, usually because people  outside of the school have brought guns and killed them, though sometimes it can be students in the school itself.

One of the people at the meeting, Ginny, says, “But  we already have controlled access to school buildings, and all of the staff an d faculty wear ID badges.” The term “controlled access” (access) refers to a syste m in a building where only the people who are supposed to be in certain parts of t he building are allowed to go into those parts. It’s another way of saying a syst em of locks that prevent people who are not supposed to be in certain rooms or cert ain parts of the building from getting into those places.

Nowadays, many of these locks are electronic, so th at you put a number into the lock in order to open it, or you use a special magn etic card that you either put through something called a “card reader” that allow s you to open a door or you

bring near a card reader pad (pad) that allows you to get into a certain part of a building. “Controlled access” might also involve gu ards – people who stand next to doors, allowing people in and preventing people from going in who are not supposed to be there.

Ginny says that they already have this kind of cont rolled access to the school buildings and “all of staff and faculty wear ID bad ges” (badges). “ID” stands for “identification.” A “badge” is usually a small card  or piece of plastic that has your picture and name on it. So, an “ID badge” is someth ing that you wear that tells everyone in the building who you are and that you b elong there.

Roberto says, however, “Those measures,” meaning the things that we do already, “help to keep people out of our building w ho don’t belong here,” who aren’t supposed to be there. “But in light of what’ s happened at other schools,” he says, “we need to do more to keep students safe. ” The expression “in light (light) of” means considering, or thinking about, o r because of. Roberto is saying that because of what has happened at other schools,  their school needs to do more to keep students safe.

Ginny then asks, “You mean in the event of bomb thr eats and mass shootings?” The expression “in the event (event) of” means if o r when something happens. “In the event of rain, we will not be playing the b aseball game today.” That means if it rains, we won’t be playing baseball. Ginny sa ys, “In the event of bomb (bomb) threats (threats) and mass (mass) shootings (shooti ngs).”

A “bomb threat” is when someone says that there is a bomb in a certain place, and you better leave there or you might be killed. A “bomb” is a device, a thing that blows up and can kill you or hurt you. A “bomb  threat,” then, is sometimes used to scare people to get people out of a certain  place. A “mass shooting” is when many different people are killed, several peop le are killed in a short period of time.

Roberto says, “Those are some of the threats we hav e to prepare for.” Ginny says, “I don’t know how we can prepare for those th ings.” “I don’t know how we can get ready for a bomb threat or mass shootings,”  she’s saying. Roberto says, “Well, we might consider,” meaning we should think about, “security cameras and armed guards to patrol the school.”

“Security cameras” are cameras, video cameras, that  are usually put in the corner of a room or outside of a building to film o r make a video of everything happening in that area. These are more common in ot her countries, I think, than in the U.S., especially in Great Britain. You hear a lot about something called

“CCTV,” which stands for “closed-circuit television .” These are basically security cameras that film or take videos of everything that  is happening in a room or in a certain area.

“Armed” (armed) means with a gun. A “guard” (guard)  is a person whose job it is to protect a certain group of people or an area. So , “armed guards” are guards that have guns. Armed guards typically “patrol” (pa trol). “To patrol” means to walk around a certain area or drive around a certain are a in order to protect it and keep it safe. Roberto is suggesting that perhaps the school have guards with guns that would walk around the school in order to keep the students safe.

Ginny doesn’t think this is a good idea. She says, “Really?” She’s indicating her doubt by saying that. Roberto replies, “Really,” me aning yes. “We need to develop evacuation plans or procedures for lockdown  in the event of an imminent threat.” An “evacuation” (evacuation) is when every one has to leave a certain place because it’s dangerous there. An “evacuation plan” would be a plan or a list of steps that would be taken if, in this case,  the school had to be evacuated. Notice there is a verb “to evacuate” from which we get the word “evacuation.”

A “lockdown” (lockdown) is when the doors of a buil ding are locked to stop anyone from going out or coming in. This might be n ecessary if, for example, you want to prevent any of the children from leaving the school if there is someone dangerous near the school. An “imminent (imminent) threat” is something that is about to happen very soon. Anything that is “immine nt” will be happening in the very near future, maybe in a few minutes or in a fe w hours or perhaps a few days.

Ginny says, “This is scary stuff.” Something that i s “scary” (scary) is something that makes you afraid, something that gives you fea r. Roberto says, “We live in scary times,” meaning we live in a dangerous period  of history. Ginny says, “It’s starting to feel like we work in a prison, not a sc hool.” A “prison” (prison) is a building where we keep criminals – people who have broken the law. Another word for “prison” is a “jail” (jail).

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
