This episode is called “Preparing to Travel.”  It’s a dia logue between Shannon and Ignacio using a lot of vocabulary that you would ne ed before you go on a trip.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Shannon:  It looks like you’re ready for your trip.  You must be psyched. 

Ignacio:  Yeah, I am.  I’m almost ready.  I’ve gone to the post office and filled out a form so they’ll hold my mail while I’m gone. 

Shannon:  I could pick up your mail for you. 

Ignacio:  Thanks, but it’ll just be easier this way.  I’ve also called the newspaper office to have my newspaper delivery suspended.  Tomorrow  I’ll arrange for my bank to automatically pay my bills so I won’t have my utili ties cut off or accrue any late fees.   

Shannon:  I could pay your bills for you.  I don’t min d. 

Ignacio:  It’s nice of you to offer, but I’ve got it cover ed.  This morning, I took my plants over to my neighbor’s house.  He agreed to water  them for me while I’m gone. 

Shannon:  I could have come over and watered your plan ts.  That wouldn’t have been a problem at all.  

 Ignacio:  Thanks for being willing to do that.  As alwa ys, you’re so helpful.   

Shannon:  Oh, I try my best… 

Ignacio:  I was wondering if I could ask just one favor from you. 

Shannon:  Of course you can.  Just name it!   

Ignacio:  You know my dog, Rex…   

Shannon:  Oh, no… 

Ignacio:  I could board him at a kennel, but he’s had  bad luck at kennels.  Could you look after him while I’m gone? 

Shannon:  No way! 

Ignacio:  Why? 

Shannon:  Why don’t you ask the people who worked at tho se kennels where Rex has been?  I’m willing to pitch in, but I’m no sucker !

Shannon begins the dialogue by saying, “It looks like you’r e ready for your trip. You must be psyched.”  “To be psyched” (psyched) means to be very excited about something.  It’s a very informal expression; it mean s you are mentally prepared for something, something that you want to d o, that you are looking forward to do. 

Ignacio says, “Yeah, I am.  I’m almost ready (I’m nearly ready, not quite).  I’ve gone to the post office and filled out a form (a piece  of paper) so they’ll hold my mail while I’m gone.”  “To hold the mail,” or “hold  your mail” means not to have your mail delivered to your house for a specific period o f time.  In other words, the post office, the local building where the mail is t aken care of, they will keep your mail at the post office while you are on vacation.  The reason people do this is because they don’t want all this mail coming to their house and people would realize they weren’t there and therefore they might tr y to steal something.  So, it’s very common for people to hold their mail when they go on a long vacation, let’s say a week or more.  That’s what Ignacio is doing.    

 Shannon says, “I could pick up your mail for you (I could d rive to your house every day or every other day – every second day, and get it f or you).”  Ignacio says, “Thanks, but it’ll just be easier this way.  I’ve also ca lled the newspaper office to have my newspaper delivery suspended.”  “To susp end (something)” means to temporarily – for a short time – stop doing som ething.  You plan on doing it again in the future, but for right now you  don’t want it done.  In this case, Ignacio is suspending his newspaper delivery, where they com e every morning and bring a newspaper to your house.  I have my newspap er delivered every morning.  Well, Ignacio, because he’s going to be gone,  doesn’t want a bunch of newspapers sitting outside his house, which is, again, som ething that if you were a thief – if you were someone who likes to rob or stea l things from houses, you would see that and think the person is not at home and you can break into their house.  It’s the same idea as we mentioned about the ma il.  “Suspend” has a couple of different meanings in English; you can find those in this episode’s Learning Guide. 

Ignacio says, “Tomorrow I’ll arrange for my bank (I will call my bank and tell them) to automatically pay my bills so I won’t have my uti lities cut off or accrue any late fees.”  So, Ignacio is calling his bank and tell ing them to automatically pay his bills.  Many banks now, on their websites, allow you  to pay your bills electronically.  And, you can even have it done automatical ly, so you don’t even have to go into the website, they will automatically pay the bill for you, and that’s what Ignacio wants.  He’s especially concerned about his ut ilities.  A “utility” (utility) is a service that is provided by typically the gover nment to you.  We are referring to your water, your gas, your electricity; the se are all things that the government – the local government takes care of, but of co urse, you have to pay for it.  Collectively – that is, as a group – we call th ese utilities.  If you are renting an apartment sometimes it will include utilities, mean ing it would be part of your rent, you don’t have to pay extra.  Sometimes it doesn’t.   Ignacio is concerned that they will cut off his utilities.  “To cut off” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to stop providing a service, usually because you haven’t paid  for it.  So if you don’t pay your phone bill, the phone company will cut of f your service; you will no longer be able to use it.  He’s also concerned about acc ruing late fees.  “To accrue” (accrue) means to have something add up over time,  for something to increase or become larger.  Usually we use this verb when w e are talking about something financial – something related to money.  If you don’t pay your utilities, the utility company may charge you an extra fee – an extra amount of money for being late.  That’s what a late fee is.  Ignacio doesn’ t want to have a bunch of late fees he has to pay, so that’s why he wants his bills pa id automatically. 

 Shannon, again, offers to help.  She says, “I could pa y your bills for you.  I don’t mind,” meaning it’s no problem for me.  Ignacio says, “I t’s nice of you to offer, but I’ve got it covered.”  “To have something covered,” or “t o have got something covered” is an informal way of saying that you have alread y fixed the problem or you have taken care of the problem; you have everything under control, we might also say.  Ignacio says, “This morning, I took my plants over to my neighbor’s house,” his flowers perhaps.  Ignacio says the neighbor agr eed to water them for me while I’m gone.  “To water,” here, means to give t he plants water so that they don’t die.  This is the problem I think I have; when I  get a plant I forget to water it and it dies.  I don’t know why the plant doesn’t ask me for the water – tell me it’s thirsty.  I just don’t understand! 

Anyway, back to the episode.  Shannon says, “I could have come  over and watered your plants (I could have come over if you had a sked me)…”  This is what we call a conditional clause.  “That wouldn’t have been a problem at all.” Again, there’s an idea of if you do something then I w ould do something else. But Shannon, of course, was not asked by Ignacio, and tha t’s why she’s using the conditional form. 

Ignacio says, “Thanks for being willing to do that.  As al ways, you’re so helpful.” Shannon says, “Oh, I try my best (I do my best)…”  Ignacio then says, “I was wondering if I could ask just one favor from you (ask you to  do one thing).” Shannon says, “Of course you can.  Just name it!”  When som eone says, “name it” they mean you are willing to do whatever the other  person wants or needs.  It’s an informal phrase; it’s saying I will do whatever you w ant me to do. 

Ignacio says, “You know my dog, Rex…”  Rex is the name of th e dog.  Shannon says, “Oh, no…”  Ignacio says, “I could board him at a kennel , but he’s had bad luck at kennels.”  A “kennel” is a place where you can leave your dog or your cat or other small pets while you are traveling.  It’s like a  hotel for animals.  “To board” means, in this case, to pay for the animal to be  at the kennel.  Ignacio says, “Could you look after him while I’m gone?”  “To lo ok after (someone)” means to take care of someone, to keep someone safe or o ut of trouble: “My mother is sick, I need to go to her house to look after her.”   

Shannon, however, says, “No way!” meaning absolutely not,  I will not look after your dog.  Ignacio says, “Why?”  Shannon says, “Why don’t y ou ask the people who worked at those kennels where Rex has been?”  In oth er words, if Rex had a problem at the kennel it’s probably because he’s not a  good dog.  Shannon says, “I’m willing to pitch in, but I’m no sucker!”  “To p itch (pitch) in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to help someone do something, to assist with something,  

 typically doing a small part of a larger project or job .  If you have a big project at work the boss may ask everyone to pitch in – every one to hel p, or he may use another phrasal verb: “to help out.” 

Shannon says she is willing to pitch in, but she’s no sucker – she’s not a sucker (sucker).  A “sucker” is a person who is easily fooled, who is easily tricked.  We might also say a “gullible” person.  In Shakespeare’s pla y Othello , Othello was sort of a sucker.  He was someone who believed everything t hat he was told. Well, this expression is very informal, but it means same th ing: someone who believes what he or she is told and is easily fooled.  Th e word is sometimes used as an insult: “See you later sucker!”  You shouldn’t say th at typically, however, it’s kind of a mean thing and someone might decide to p ut their fist into your face if you say that! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
