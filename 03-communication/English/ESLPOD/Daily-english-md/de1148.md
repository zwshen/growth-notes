This episode is a dialogue between Mona and Leonard o about the way we describe people’s faces. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mona: How is the portrait coming along?

Leonardo: I’m done with the sketches and I’m ready to start on the painting.

Mona: This commission is quite a godsend for a new artist. If you do a good job with this portrait, you may get other commissions.

Leonardo: It’s all the same to me. I paint them as I see them.

Mona: Well, I hope not exactly as you see them. A p ortrait has to be flattering, doesn’t it?

Leonardo: You mean I should downplay bulging eyes, hooked noses, and double chins? No way. That’s what makes each face distinct ive.

Mona: Maybe that isn’t the best way to think about it. Everybody has an image of themselves in their mind’s eye. You would just be c apturing that image.

Leonardo: I’m an artist, not a psychologist. If the y have squinty eyes, ears that stick out, a weak chin, or thin lips, that’s what I ’m going to paint.

Mona: But this sketch shows a really prominent fore head and a receding hairline. Maybe you could just . . .

Leonardo: No! I have to be true to my art. I’m not compromising.

 Mona: [sigh] I was just hoping you could finally ma ke enough money to move off of my couch!

Mona begins by asking Leonardo, “How is the portrai t coming along?” A “portrait” (portrait) is a formal painting – or nowadays, phot ograph – of a person. It could be either one. Normally a portrait is of the person ’s upper body – his head, neck, shoulders, perhaps his chest. Many governments have  official portraits of their leaders, for example. A famous person might want a portrait of himself or herself. Mona asks how the portrait is “coming along,” meani ng how is it going.

Usually when you ask someone how something is “comi ng along,” you are implying that the person has started it already, an d you want to know how much progress he’s made. Leonardo says, “I’m done with the sketches and I’m ready to start on the painting.” A “sketch” (sketch) is a simple drawing that is made, often when you are preparing to paint something – paint a portrait  or a picture. Sometimes people like to sketch just to get ideas for their p ieces of art, for their paintings. Leonardo is “done with” – that is, he has completed  – the sketches for the portrait.

Mona says, “This commission is quite a godsend for a new artist.” A “commission” here refers to a request for an artist  to do something, usually in exchange for money. A rich person may commission a portrait of his family, or of his wife, or of himself. Sometimes governments will  give money to artists; they will commission a piece of art – a painting or perh aps a piece of music. Mona says, “This commission is quite a godsend” (godsend ). A “godsend” is something that is very fortunate, something that seems to com e from heaven, something that is very beneficial for you.

Mona says, “If you do a good job with this portrait , you may get other commissions.” Leonardo says, “It’s all the same to me.” He doesn’t seem to care if he gets other commissions. He says, “I paint the m as I see them.” Mona says, “Well, I hope not exactly as you see them. A portra it has to be flattering, doesn’t it?” Mona is saying that Leonardo needs to paint the portrait of whomever he’s painting so that the person looks beautiful, that t he person looks good. That’s what we mean by the word “flattering” (flattering).  Something that is “flattering” makes someone feel good, or important, or in this c ase, attractive.

The verb “to flatter” means to tell someone how goo d they look or how important they are – “to pay someone a compliment,” we might also say. Mona says, “A portrait has to be flattering.” It has to make the person look good. Leonardo says, “You mean I should downplay bulging eyes, hooked no ses, and double chins? No way.” “To downplay” means to act as if something  were smaller or less important than it actually is. Another verb here wo uld be “to de-emphasize” the importance of something. “To downplay the importanc e” of something is to act as though it isn’t very important.

Leonardo then lists, or gives us a list of, the fea tures or things that you might see in a person’s face that are not very attractive. Th ese include “bulging eyes,” “hooked noses,” and “double chins.” A “bulging (bul ging) eye (eye)” is an eye that sticks out from the surface of the face and it appe ars to be larger than it should be. Some people have very bulging eyes, very big ey es. The eyes seem too big for the face. A “hooked (hooked) nose” is a nose th at seems to have a bend or a curve in the upper half of it.

“Double chins” are chins that are fat. Your “chin” (chin) is the bottom part of your face, below your mouth. If you have a “double chin, ” you may have some extra fat in your face that makes it look as though you h ave a second chin below your regular chin, I guess you could say. Leonardo doesn ’t believe in downplaying these features, these things that are part of one’s  face, or could be part of one’s face. He says, “That’s what makes each face distinc tive” (distinctive). “Distinctive” means different, unique.

Mona says, “Maybe that isn’t the best way to think about it. Everybody has an image of themselves in their mind’s eye.” What Mona  is saying is that each person has an image or a way that he sees himself, a way that he imagines himself or she imagines herself. Your “mind’s (mind ’s) eye” is the way that you think about something, the way you imagine somethin g. Mona says, “You would just be capturing that image.” She’s saying that the purpose of the portrait is to try to get the image that the person has of himself  in his own mind.

Leonardo, however, says, “I’m an artist, not a psyc hologist. If they have squinty eyes, ears that stick out, a weak chin, or thin lip s, that’s what I’m going to paint.” Once again, Leonardo gives us a list of facial feat ures – that is, things that you notice about a person’s face. These include “squint y (squinty) eyes.” “Squinty eyes” are eyes that are partially closed. It almost  looks as though the person may be falling asleep.

If your ears “stick out,” your ears go out or exten d out from your head farther than what would be normal. Some people say President Oba ma has ears that stick

out, that go out away from his head farther than yo u might normally expect ears to go. I don’t know if that’s true or not. In gener al, the phrasal verb “to stick out” means to extend outward from the surface of somethi ng.

We also use that phrasal verb to refer to something  or someone who is very noticeable, often in a bad way. If you go to the be ach dressed in a suit and a tie, you will “stick out” because everyone else will be different – everyone else will be dressed differently than you are dressed. That’s an other meaning of the phrasal verb “to stick out.” Leonardo also mentions someone  having a “weak (weak) chin.” A “weak chin” is a chin that you almost don’ t notice, a chin that doesn’t seem to be very distinctive, almost as though it’s part of your neck or that you don’t have a chin.

Leonardo says he’s going to paint people how they l ook. He’s not going to try to hide these somewhat unattractive facial features. M ona says, “But this sketch shows a really prominent forehead and a receding ha irline.” Your “forehead” (forehead) is the top of your head above your eyes and below where most people have hair. A “prominent (prominent) forehead” is a forehead that doesn’t have very much hair covering it, or perhaps is a forehea d that is bigger than you would normally expect.

Your “hairline” (hairline) is the line that is form ed by your hair – where your hair ends, if you will, at the top of your head. Now, so me, particularly men, as they get older have what’s called a “receding (receding) hai rline.” “Receding” comes from the verb “to recede,” which means to draw back or t o go back. A receding hairline is when you start losing your hair so that you don’ t have a lot of hair at the front of your head.

Some of us have receding hairlines and have decided  to simply get rid of all of our hair so you don’t notice it. I know someone lik e that. Mona is once again pointing out to Leonardo that there are some facial  features in his portrait that the person who commissioned the portrait might not be v ery happy about. Leonardo, however, says, “No! I have to be true to my art.” “ To be true to” something means to defend it or to be loyal to it, not to do anythi ng that would hurt it.

There was an old song by the Beach Boys called “Be True to Your School,” meaning, I suppose, that you were supposed to be lo yal to your school. In particular, I think the song was about a person’s h igh school. “To be true to your school” would be to support it, not to say bad thin gs about it. I don’t know if I can be true to my high school. But certainly, some peop le feel great loyalty to the schools that they attended, that they were students  in.

Leonardo was talking about being true to his art. H e says, “I’m not compromising.” “To compromise” means to not do what  you want to do – to perhaps change things in order to get along with so meone else, or in this case, to make the person who commissioned the portrait happy . Mona is disappointed. She says, “I was just hoping you could finally make  enough money to move off of my couch.” Your “couch” (couch) is your sofa. It’s a large piece of furniture, usually in your living room, where two or more peop le can sit.

Mona is complaining that Leonardo is apparently sle eping on her couch, meaning he doesn’t have a place to stay. He doesn’t have hi s own apartment, so he’s staying with her temporarily. Of course, one of the  reasons he doesn’t have his own apartment is that he doesn’t have enough money to go and get his own place to live. Mona is hoping that he can be a succ essful artist so that he can make money and stop sleeping on her couch.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
