This episode is called “Working in a Dead End Job.”  It’s a conversation between Kurt and a woman who works at an “employment agency,” a company that helps you find a job.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Agency employee:  Tell me why you’d like to sign up with our employment agency.  Kurt:  Well, right now I’m working in a dead end job.  There are no opportunities for advancement.  I’m already at the top of the pay scale, so there’s no chance of another pay raise.  Agency employee:  Okay, I’d like to find out a little more about your employment history.  Tell me about your last job.  Kurt:  Oh, that was a mind-numbing position.  I did menial work all day and I burned out in six months.    Agency employee:  What about the job you had before that?    Kurt:  The problem with that job was that there was a glass ceiling.  They would never promote a person like me.  Agency employee:  And what about the job you had before that?  Kurt:  I only took that job as a steppingstone to the next one, but it turned out to be a stumbling block instead.  My boss didn’t like me and wouldn’t give me a good reference.
