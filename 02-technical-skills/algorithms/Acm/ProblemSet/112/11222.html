<h1>D. Only I did it!</h1>

<h3>Time limit: 1s</h3>

<p> Once upon a time, in the land of Ceeplenty, lived 3 friends that
liked to solve problems. They used internet engines to look for
problems and they often tried to solve the problems that none of the
other 2 had solved. They once met you and you managed to convince them
that you were better at problem solving. So they asked you to write a
program that tells which of the 3 friends solved more problems that
none of the other 2 have solved.  </p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases, <math>T</math>
(<math>1 &le; T &le; 20</math>). <math>T</math> test cases follow.
Each test case is composed of three lines corresponding to the
problems solved by the first, second and third friend,
respectively. Each of these lines has an integer <math>S</math>
(<math>0 &le; S &le; 1000</math>) followed by the list of
<math>S</math> solved problems. A solved problem is identified uniquely by
a positive integer smaller or equal than <math>10000</math>.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>The output is comprised a line identifying the test case with the
string <tt>Case #C:</tt> (where <tt>C</tt> is the number of the
current test case). Then print another line with the number of the
friend (1, 2 or 3) asked in the description followed by the number of
problems that he solved but none of the other 2 did, followed by the
sorted list of these problems in one line. When there is a tie, print
one such line for each tied friend, sorted by the number of the
friend.
</p>

<h2>Sample input</h2>

7 400 401 402 403 404 405 406
1 1
1 2
1 3
</pre>

<h2>Sample output</h2>

<pre>

Case #2:

Case #3:
2 2 100 101
Case #4:
1 1 1
2 1 2
3 1 3
