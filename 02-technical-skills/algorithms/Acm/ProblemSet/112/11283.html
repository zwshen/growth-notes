<h1>Problem F</h1>
<h1>PLAYING BOGGLE</h1>
</center>

<p>Boggle&reg; is a classic word game played on a 4 by 4 grid of letters.
The letter grid is randomly generated by shaking 16 cubes labeled with a distribution
 of letters similar to that found in English words. Players try to find words hidden within the grid.</p>
 
<p>Words are formed from letters that adjoin horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
However, no letter may be used more than once within a single word.</p>

<p align=center><em>An example Boggle&reg; letter grid, showing the formation of the words "taxes" and "rise".</em></p>

<p>The score awarded for a word depends on its length, with longer words being worth more points. 
Exact point values are shown in the table below. 
A word is only ever scored once, even if it appears multiple times in the grid.</p>

      <td>8 or more<br>

<p>In this problem, your task is to write a program that plays Boggle&reg;. 
Given a letter grid and a dictionary of words, you are to calculate the total score of all the words in the dictionary that can be found in the grid.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains a number N, the number of Boggle&reg; games that follow.</p>

<p>Each Boggle&reg; game begins with 16 capital letters arranged in a 4 by 4 grid,
representing the board configuration for that game. 
A blank line always precedes the letter grid. 
Following the letter grid is a single number M (1 &le; M &le; 100), the number of words in your dictionary
 for that game. The next M lines contain the dictionary words, one per line, in no particular order. 
 Each word consists of between 3 and 16 capital letters. 
No single word will appear in the dictionary more than once for a given Boggle&reg; game.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each Boggle&reg; game in the input, your program should output the total score for that game. 
Follow the format given in the sample output.</p>
