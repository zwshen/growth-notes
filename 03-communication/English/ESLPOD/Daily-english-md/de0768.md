This episode is a dialogue between Justin and Rache l about trying to get the best price for something that you’re going to buy.  Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Justin:  Hello.

Rachel:  Hi, Justin.  It’s Rachel from McQ Corp.

Justin:  Oh hi, Rachel.  Did you get our bid for the job?

Rachel:  Yes, we did.  We like your proposal, but w e still need to come to terms on the price.

Justin:  We’ve already given you our rock-bottom pr ice because we want to get this job, but we always try to be flexible.

Rachel:  Good.  Could you do better on what you’ve quoted us for labor?  The price seemed a little high.

Justin:  We might be able to trim a little off of t hat.  How about if we discount that by 10 percent?

Rachel:  That’s an attractive offer, but we were ho ping for 20 percent.

Justin:  You’re driving a hard bargain.  We have ce rtain fixed costs, you know.

Rachel:  I do and that’s why I’m only asking about labor costs.  Can you meet me halfway at 15 percent?

 Justin:  I think that might be doable, if that’s the only stumbling block to us getting the job.

Rachel:  I can’t make any promises, but I’ll do my best.

Justin:  That’s all I can ask.  I’ll send you over a revised bid.

Rachel:  Great.  I hope to have good news for you n ext week.

We begin our phone conversation with Justin saying,  “Hello.”  Rachel says, “Hi, Justin.  It’s Rachel from McQ Corp.”  “Oh hi, Rache l,” Justin says, “Did you get our bid for the job?”  To understand “bid” (bid) yo u have to think of a company or an individual person who wants to get something don e, or perhaps wants to purchase something – buy something.  A company may ask other companies, “How much will you charge me?”  How much will it co st me to do this, to build a new building or to paint my offices or whatever it happens to be?  These different companies will then give you a proposal that includ es a price: “Well, we will charge you 25 dollars,” or, “25,000 dollars,” whate ver it is.  That proposal, with a price, is called a “bid.”  So, a “bid” is something  that I give to another company, telling them how much I will charge them to do what ever they want to have done. “Bid” actually has a few other meanings in English,  as well, and those can be found – where else? – in the Learning Guide.

Rachel said, “Yes, we did (receive your bid).”  She  says, “We like your proposal (what you are suggesting or proposing to do), but w e still need to come to terms on the price.”  “To come to terms” (terms) means to  reach an agreement or an understanding, to agree on something.  Justin says,  “We’ve already given you our rock-bottom price.”  The expression “rock-botto m” means as low as possible; usually we’re talking about a price for something.  What Justin is saying here is that the price that they gave Rachel and McQ Corp. is the lowest possible price they can give them; they can’t give them any more d iscount, it’s the rock-bottom price.  Sometimes people use “rock-bottom” as a nou n, especially with the verb “hit.”  “I’ve hit rock-bottom” means I’ve gone as l ow as I can go, especially if you are having difficulties or you have some sort of pr oblem.  Usually it’s a negative thing to hit rock-bottom.  Justin says, “We’ve alre ady given you our rock-bottom price because we want to get this job (meaning we w ant you hire us), but we always try to be flexible.”  “To be flexible” (flex ible) means to be willing to change, to be willing to do something different; in this ca se, perhaps, to be willing to lower the price.

 Rachel says, “Good.  Could you do better on what yo u’ve quoted us for labor?” “To do better on” means to improve in some way.  Wh at Rachel is asking for is a lower price on what Justin has quoted them for labo r.  “To quote” means to give a price, usually in writing.  A “quote” is similar to  a “bid.”  Here it’s used as a verb to mean to give someone a price – a definite price wri tten down, here’s how much I’m going to charge you.  “Labor” is the amount of money you pay people to work. So if you are painting your house, labor would be t he amount of money you have to pay the painters, the people who actually put the paint on your house.  The other part of the cost would be the supplies, the t hings they actually use; in this case, the cans of paint that they have to buy.  Rac hel says, “The price (the price for labor) seemed a little high.”  Rachel’s company  thought it was too high.

Justin says, “We might be able to trim a little off  of that.”  “To trim” (trim) means to reduce the amount of something or make something a little bit smaller; to trim your hair would be to cut a little bit of your hair  off of your head.  “Trim” has a few other meanings, which can be found, once again, in our Learning Guide.  Justin says, “We might be able to trim a little off of tha t (to lower the price).  How about (what do you think) if we discount that by 10 perce nt?”  “To discount,” as a verb, means to lower or reduce the price of something.

Rachel says, “That’s an attractive offer, but we we re hoping for 20 percent.” “Attractive” here means appealing, something that m akes you want to accept it, something that sounds or looks good to you.  “Attra ctive,” when used to describe a person, would mean someone who’s very good lookin g: a handsome man, a beautiful woman.  Rachel says that the offer – the proposal that Justin gave of a 10 percent discount is attractive, it’s nice, but h er company was hoping for 20 percent, a 20 percent discount on the price of labo r.

Justin says, “You’re driving a hard bargain.”  The expression “to drive a hard bargain” (bargain) means to be a difficult, we migh t say a “tough” negotiator.  A “negotiator” is someone who negotiates a price.  “T o negotiate” means to go back and forth with someone to get the best price y ou possibly can – the lowest price you possibly can, and that’s what Rachel is d oing; she’s negotiating the price.  She’s saying, “Well, we’d like it a little lower,” and Justin is saying, “Well, we can’t go that low.  How about this?” and they go  back and forth, each one of them saying something, and eventually they will agr ee on a price.  But if you make it very difficult for the other person to agre e with you, if you ask for a lot of things or want a very low price, we might say that you drive a hard bargain; you are very difficult to negotiate with.

Justin says, “We have certain fixed costs, you know .”  A “fixed cost” is a kind of expense that you have to pay for, no matter how muc h business you have.  So if you have an office in a building, you have to pay r ent every month.  It doesn’t matter how much business you are doing – how much y ou are selling, the person who owns the building wants his or her money for the rent.  So that’s what we would call a “fixed cost.”  It doesn’t go up or dow n, typically, depending upon the amount of things or services that you sell.

Rachel says, “I do (meaning I understand you have c ertain fixed costs) and that’s why I’m only asking about labor costs.”  Then she s ays, “Can you meet me halfway at 15 percent?”  When you say, “can you mee t me halfway” (halfway – one word), you mean can we compromise, can we divid e it in half.  Can we – another expression – split the difference?  You wan t 25 percent, I want 15 percent; we agree on 20 percent, it’s halfway betwe en 15 and 25.  So, the expression is “Can you meet me halfway?”

Justin says, “I think that might be doable.”  “Doab le” means you are able to do it, it’s possible.  He says it “might be doable, if tha t’s the only stumbling block to us getting the job.”  A “stumbling (stumbling) block ( block)” is something that makes it difficult but not impossible for you to get what  you want, to reach your goal.  In this case, Justin wants to get the contract from Ra chel’s company.  He wants to be able to sell his services to her company.  A “st umbling block” would be something that gets in the way, some difficulty.  H e’s saying that if the labor cost is the only stumbling block he might be able to com promise – to meet her halfway – by reducing the labor cost by 15 percent.

Rachel says, “I can’t make any promises, but I’ll d o my best.”  Justin is asking her if there’s going to be anything else she wants to a sk for, and she’s saying that she can’t make any promises.  She can’t say yes def initely, but she’ll do her best; she’ll try to make sure that this is the only thing  she asks for.  Justin says, “That’s all I can ask,” meaning that’s all I want you to do , to do your best.  He says, “I’ll send you over (I’ll send you) a revised bid.”  “Rev ised” means corrected, updated, changed.  Rachel says, “Great.  I hope to have good news for you next week,” meaning I hope I will be able to tell you th at you – your company – got the job; we are going to hire you next week.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
