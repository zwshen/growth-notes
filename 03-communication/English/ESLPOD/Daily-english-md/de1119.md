Michael: And if that doesn’t work?

Lisa: The last resort is acupuncture. Some people s ay that’s effective for quitting smoking.

Lisa begins our dialogue by saying, “This is it. I’ m quitting smoking for good.” “To quit smoking” means to stop smoking cigarettes and never smoke them again. “For good” is an expression we use to mean forever,  permanently, from now on. “My girlfriend and I have broken up for good.” We’r e not ever going to get back together. Michael says to Lisa, “Good for you” afte r she tells him she is going to quit smoking, or stop smoking. “Good for you,” whic h is another way of congratulating someone, saying that they have done something good.

He says, “Are you going cold turkey?” The phrase “t o go cold turkey” (turkey) means to quit something immediately – not to use a little less today and perhaps a little less the day after that until you finally stop, but rather to stop immediately without trying to reduce your use before you stop u sing it. Lisa says, “No, I tried that but it didn’t work.” She tried going cold turk ey but it didn’t work.

You may be wondering why it’s called “cold turkey.”  No one knows exactly for sure. The original meaning of the expression was to  speak plainly – to not try to use big words or complicated sentences, but to spea k the truth in a simple way. So perhaps the idea of quitting something immediate ly, without any other sorts of devices or approaches. But in any case, nowadays “t o go cold turkey” means to stop doing some sort of bad habit, like smoking, im mediately.

Lisa says she is not going to go cold turkey. She s ays, “I craved cigarettes too much,” referring to the last time she tried to stop  smoking that way. “To crave” (crave) something is to have a very strong desire t o eat it or drink it or have it. Usually we crave things that are physical pleasures  – like for example, the pleasure of eating or drinking certain kinds of dri nk.

Michael says, “How about nicotine gum?” Michael is giving Lisa a suggestion – perhaps she should try “nicotine (nicotine) gum (gu m).” “Gum” is a substance you put in your mouth to chew. Nicotine gum is a specia l kind of gum that has certain chemicals – nicotine – that are found in cigarettes , and it allows you to get a little bit of nicotine without actually having to smoke.

Michael asks if Lisa has tried nicotine gum. She sa ys, “Yes, but I don’t like the side effects.” A “side effect” is some unwanted con sequence of using a particular

medicine or drug. Sometimes when you take a drug to  help your body heal or feel better, it can cause other problems in your bo dy. It might cause you a headache or to have an upset stomach. These are sid e effects of some drugs. It may make you sleepy.

Lisa says the side effect of nicotine gum for her w as that it “irritated” her throat. “To irritate” (irritate) here means to cause a part  of your body to become scratchy or red or uncomfortable. If something irritates you r throat, it causes a strange, somewhat painful feeling in your throat. The verb “ to irritate” can also mean to make someone else mad. So I guess you could think o f it as, in this sense, the nicotine gun making her throat mad, maybe. Your “th roat” (throat) is the part of the body inside of your neck. We breathe and eat an d drink using our throat, normally.

Michael says, “That’s too bad.” He’s saying it’s un fortunate that the nicotine gum irritates Lisa’s throat. He says, “I suppose you’ve  tried nicotine patches, too?” A “nicotine patch” (patch) is like a sticker that you  put on your body that delivers medicine into your body. A “nicotine patch” would d eliver nicotine chemicals into your body, similar to a nicotine gum. Once again, t he purpose is to get the nicotine into your body to satisfy its cravings wit hout actually smoking the cigarette.

Lisa says, “Yes, I have.” She has tried the nicotin e patches. She says, however, “I became addicted to the patches and couldn’t wean  myself off of them.” “To become addicted” (addicted) to something is to have  a strong desire or need for a particular substance, or even experience. It’s su ch a strong desire that it has other negative effects on your life. Lisa says she became addicted to the nicotine patch, which of course was supposed to help her sto p smoking, help her stop being addicted to cigarettes.

However, Lisa says she couldn’t wean herself off of  them. “To wean (wean) yourself off of” something is to gradually use some  substance less and less until finally you don’t use it at all. It’s to reduce the  amount that you have or that you do slowly, in order to eventually stop doing it or having it altogether. Lisa says, “I just traded one addiction for another.” “To trade” means to give one thing and to get another thing back. In this case, she stopped s moking, but then she became addicted to the nicotine patch.

Michael gives another suggestion to Lisa, “And elec tronic cigarettes?” “Electronic cigarettes,” sometimes called e-cigarettes, are bas ically pen-shaped devices. They look sort of like a cigarette. The devices, the electronic cigarettes, turn

nicotine into a gas that you then put into your bod y, but it doesn’t have the same harmful effects of smoking – at least, that’s the t heory.

Lisa says, “They only made me want to smoke a real cigarette.” She said that smoking an electronic cigarette made her want to sm oke a real cigarette. I’m not sure if that’s always true. Some people say it’s the opposite. But in any case, that is what happened to Lisa. She says, “They were no h elp at all.” Michael then asks, “So, what now?” meaning “What are you going t o do now?”

Lisa says, “I’m going to try hypnosis.” “Hypnosis” (hypnosis) is a technique in which a person appears to be asleep, but can still hear and answer questions. Some people use hypnosis to help change their behav ior, to stop doing something that they want to stop doing, like in thi s case, smoking cigarettes. I’ve never actually been “hypnotized.” That’s the verb w e would use. I have never been under hypnosis. I’m not sure if it would work with me, but some people say it works.

Lisa says, “I hear that it,” meaning hypnosis, “wor ks for some people.” Michael says, “And if that doesn’t work?” He’s asking what Lisa’s going to do if hypnosis does not help her quit smoking. Lisa responds, “The  last resort is acupuncture.” A “last (last) resort (resort)” is the last option that you have when everything else has failed. Usually it’s something that you don’t r eally want to do.

If you’re having an argument with your girlfriend, you might try to talk to her. You might try to give her a gift. You might try being n ice to her. But as a last resort, you can always break up with her. You can always en d your relationship. That’s not something you want to do, but if you have to, y ou could. It’s the last option for action. For Lisa, the last resort is “acupuncture” (acupuncture). “Acupuncture” is a treatment involving putting small sharp pieces of  metal called “needles” in your skin.

Some people say that you can use acupuncture to red uce pain, or to in this case help you quit smoking. I actually had a good friend  that I used to teach with, a German teacher, who quit smoking, I suppose, 10 yea rs or so before I had met her. She says that she used acupuncture. She went t o an acupuncturist and the person put some sort of needle into her ear, and sh e said from that day on, she didn’t want to smoke another cigarette. Well, maybe  it was for some other reason, I don’t know, but that’s what she told me.

Michael seems a little skeptical about acupuncture.  He doesn’t seem to think it is going to work. That’s why he says, “If you say so.”  That expression “if you say so” is used when you don’t really believe what the other person is saying, but you

don’t want to argue about it either. Michael says, “Sometimes the cure is truly worse than the disease.” A “cure” (cure) is somethi ng that helps you get better, to get better physically, to get healthier. A “disease ” (disease) is something that hurts your body.

The expression “The cure is worse than the disease”  means that the solution that you have to get better is going to actually be wors e for you than the thing that you started with. So, if your friend hurts her hand  and you say to her, “Oh, well, I can just cut your hand off,” your friend might say,  “Well, the cure is worse than the disease.” Yes, my hand will stop hurting, but t hen I won’t have a hand.

So you don’t want the thing that you are doing to f ix a problem to make it worse, or to make the situation worse. Michael thinks that  putting needles into your body is worse than the actual disease. In this case, he’ s referring to Lisa’s habit of smoking, even though that isn’t technically a disea se.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
