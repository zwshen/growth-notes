We’re going to hear a dialogue between Scott and Na ncy about giving things to something called a “thrift store” – a store that se lls used things. Let’s get started! 

[start of dialogue] 

Scott:  That’s the last bag. Help me put these into  the truck. I want to get these to the thrift store before they stop taking donations for the day. 

Nancy:  Hold on! That bag has curtains in it.   

Scott:  I know they do. Those old curtains have bee n sitting around in the closet for 10 years. It’s time to let them go. 

Nancy:  But what about this bag? These are the chil dren’s old baby clothes. You can’t just toss these! They have such sentimental v alue. 

Scott:  You’ve kept a lot of the children’s old clo thes already, but we still have bags and bags of them in the attic.   

Nancy:  Yes, but they’re so cute.   

Scott:  It’s time to put aside sentiment and do som e spring cleaning. After all, we’re donating them to a good cause. Families visit ing the thrift store can buy them for their own children. We get a tax deduction  and our items get a new life. It’s a win-win for everybody. 

Nancy:  I don’t know about that. What?! You’re not getting rid of those chairs, are you? They still have a lot of life in them. 

Scott:  Our garage is so full of old furniture that  we don’t use. I’m putting my foot down. These have to go. 

Nancy:  But not those... 

Scott:  Yes, those and those and those. This is my punishment for marrying a pack rat!

Scott begins by saying, “That’s the last bag. Help me put these into the truck.” A truck is a large vehicle like a car. Scott says, “I  want to get these to the thrift store before they stop taking donations for the day.” A “ thrift (thrift) store” is a store that sells old things – by old I mean used. You might ha ve a book or a pair of shoes or some dishes from your kitchen that you don’t wan t anymore. Well, you can give them to this store – this thrift store – and t hey will sell them. Most of the thrift stores are owned by organizations – what we would c all “charitable organizations.” “Charitable” (charitable) means the y’re not trying to make money – these organizations, these charitable organizatio ns – they’re trying to help other people. And so, they get money by selling the se old things that people give them to sell. And that’s the next word we have here  in the sentence – “donations.” A “donation” (donation) is something y ou give to an organization so that it can be used to help that organization. In t his case, the donations are the things that you give to the thrift store so they ca n sell it and get money. 

Nancy says, “Hold on! Wait! That bag has curtains i n it.” “Curtains” (curtains) are large pieces of cloth or fabric that we use to cove r a window so that no one can see inside of your house, or if you like to sleep u ntil 10 o’clock in the morning, you want curtains to prevent the light from coming in. I don’t sleep until 10 o’clock. I get up pretty early actually – usually a round 6, 6:30 – not that early but pretty early. Scott says, “I know they do” -  I kno w this bag contains curtains. “Those old curtains have been sitting around in the  closet for 10 years.” When we say something has been “sitting around” – that two- word phrasal verb means to be somewhere but not actually doing anything import ant. It’s just taking up space. “We were sitting around in the living room, waiting for the baseball game to begin.” We were sitting around. We weren’t doing  anything very important. You can have a book that’s been sitting around your off ice for a year and you have not read it yet. It just sits there. It doesn’t do anything important or you haven’t done anything important with it.  

Scott says that the curtains that he wants to give to the thrift store have been sitting “around” in the closet for ten years. Notic e that even though “around” is a  

preposition, it’s part of the two-word phrasal verb  – “sitting around” or “to sit around” – so you can put another preposition to say  where something has been sitting around. It’s a little unusual. Well, Scott says, “These curtains have been sitting around in the closet (closet).” A “closet” is something that is usually built-in to the house. It’s like this little room where you can put things to store them – to keep them. You can have a closet for your clothes i n a bedroom or you could have a closet in your house to put other things lik e vacuum cleaners and old boxes and I don’t know – things you use to clean th e house. I don’t clean the house. My wife usually cleans the house. I know, I know, I should help. I have other things I do. I cut the grass. I do the lawn o utside so, I help, don’t worry.  

Anyway, Scott says, “It’s time to let them go” – le t the curtains go. “To let something go” means to agree not to have it anymore  or to let someone else take it because you no longer need it or you no lon ger should have it. “He’s going to let the curtains go.” Nancy says, “What about th is bag? These are the children’s old baby clothes.” Some people keep thei r children’s clothes even after the children don’t need them anymore. I don’t know why. Anyway, Nancy has done this and she says, “You can’t just toss these. ” “To toss” (toss) means to throw something away – to get rid of something, to put something in the trash. Nancy says, these baby clothes have “sentimental va lue.” “They have such sentimental value,” she says. “Sentimental (sentime ntal) value” is the feeling of wanting to keep an object because it has certain sp ecial memories for you. It’s not worth anything. It’s not like a gold ring that you can sell but it has some sort of emotional feelings attached to it. You have some  emotional memories associated with it. The first love note that your n ow-husband or wife gave you – that might be something that has sentimental value.  It’s not valuable because the piece of paper is valuable but what is associated w ith that piece of paper – what you have memories about.  

Scott says, “You’ve kept a lot of the children’s ol d clothes already. But we still have bags and bags of them in the attic.” The “atti c” (attic) is the very top of the house. Many Americans live in houses that have more  than one storey and even those that are just one storey – one level – usuall y, the house will have an attic. It will have a storage area at the very top. That’s wh at Scott is referring to. People sometimes use the attic as a place to store things,  to keep boxes, for example. Nancy says, “Yes, but they’re so cute.” She doesn’t  want to get rid of her children’s old clothes. Scott says, however, “It’s time to put aside sentiment and do some spring cleaning. “ To put aside” (aside) is  a two-word phrasal verb, meaning to separate something from a group because you want to use it for some particular purpose. For example, “My mother ma kes ten cookies for us to eat. But she puts aside two of those for my father who hasn’t come home yet.” Usually, my father wouldn’t get any cookies if my m other gave them because we  

would eat them before he came. So, my mother would have to “put them aside.” She would have to remove them, put them in another place so that we wouldn’t eat them.  

Scott says, “It’s time to put aside sentiment.” We need to not worry about or not have these sentimental values about things and do s ome “spring cleaning.” “Spring cleaning” is a time, usually during the spr ing of the year between the winter and the summer, when people go and they clea n their house – they organize things, they get rid of things they don’t need any more. Scott says, “After all, we’re donating them to a good cause” – for a good purpose. “Families visiting the thrift store can buy them for their ow n children. We get a tax deduction and our items get a new life.” When you g ive money to a charitable organization in the United States – like a thrift s tore – you can take what’s called a “tax deduction.” You can take the value of that d onation and use it to reduce the amount of taxes you owe at the end of the year.  Scott says, “It’s a win-win for everybody.” A “win-win” (win) is a situation that b enefits both people involved in the transaction – in the exchange. You get somethin g, I get something – it’s win- win. This is an expression that started to be used in the business world – I don’t know, 20, 25 years ago. 

Nancy says, “I don’t know about that.” I’m not sure . Then she says, “What? You’re not getting rid of those chairs are you? The y still have a lot of life in them.” Now she sees that Scott is trying to donate some ch airs. She says, “These chairs still have a lot of life in them,” meaning they’re still useful, we could still use them. Scott says, “Our garage is full of old furniture th at we don’t use. I’m putting my foot down. These have to go.” “To put your foot dow n” means that you are insisting – you are saying, “This is my decision. I  am not going to change it.” My wife said, “We’re going to the movies tonight” and I say, “No. I’m going to put my foot down. We’re not going to the movies.” Well, we , of course, went to the movies.  

Scott says, “These have to go.” Nancy says, “But no t those.” Scott says, “Yes, those and those and those.” He’s pointing to all of  the things they have to donate to the thrift store. Scott says, “This is my punish ment for marrying a “pack rat.” A “pack (pack) rat (rat)” is a person who likes to ke ep everything – who doesn’t throw anything away. Old clothes, old papers, old b ooks – all of these things they keep. They don’t give them away, they don’t donate them, they don’t throw them away. They keep them. That’s what we call a “pack r at.” 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
