> "Hello, you've reached the office of Leslie Munroe.  I am in a meeting or with a client. I'm sorry to miss your call. Please stay on  the line and leave a detailed message. I will return your call as soon as I can. Thank you for calling."  
> I decided to leave a message. Leslie called me righ t back and we made plans for the show. We had a great time.  
> This podcast is about the kinds of messages that yo u hear – what we would call “outgoing messages” on an answering machine. “Outgo ing” because when you call someone’s telephone and they aren’t there, the y don’t answer and they have an answering machine, there is a message that goes out from the machine. And so, we call this the “outgoing” (outgoing) – the “o utgoing” message.  

Well, the story begins with the person saying that they have two tickets to a show. And a “show” could be a movie, it could be a musical show, it could be any sort of entertainment – could be a play and so fort h. He doesn’t say, but he says he has tickets to a show and he got them at the las t minute. When we say, “at the last minute” we mean that it was right before t he event or right before the end of the possibility of getting tickets. So, if you a re going to a movie that starts at 8 PM and you buy your tickets at 7:55 PM, you got you r tickets at the last minute – the last possible chance.  

Well, he gets tickets at the last minute and he tri es to find someone to go with him. He calls Amanda. The phone rang and rang and n otice “rang” (rang) is the past tense of “to ring.” So, you hear the phone rin g and in the past tense it’s “rang.” But she wasn’t home because her answering m achine picked up. “Answering machine” is, of course, that little mach ine or device – a piece of equipment that records messages when you’re not hom e. Nowadays, most or many people have what’s called “voicemail.” “Voicem ail” – all one word (voicemail) – it can also be spelled as two separat e words, “voice” “mail” – is an electronic recording. So, you don’t have a physical , actual machine but there is an electronic system that automatically records. An d most cell phones, cellular phones, mobile phones, for example, have voicemail on them and some people in their homes – the telephone company provides an electronic voicemail.  

Well, this case, we have an answering machine – the  old kind – and the story says the answering machine “picked up.” “To pick up ” means to answer. So, if we say, “Please pick up the phone” – two words (pick) (up) – we mean to pick up literally, the receiver. And the receiver is what y ou talk into – that’s the part of the phone that has one part for your ear and one part f or your mouth. “To pick up the receiver” means to answer the phone. But here, “the  answering machine picked up,” meaning it started to play the outgoing messag e. And the message was very informal and this is the sort of message you would hear on someone’s home phone or personal phone. It said, “Hi. I’m not in r ight now.” Well, “Hi” (hi) is, of course, informal way of saying hello. So, when some one says, “Hi” in a voicemail, that is an informal address. People can also use “Hi” to start a letter or  

an email. But it’s very informal and I think a litt le more common among younger people than it is among old people like me.  

So, he says, “Hi, I’m not in,” or she says, I’m sor ry, “Hi. I’m not in right now.” When you say you are not “in” you mean that you are  not there to answer the phone. So, “I’m not in right now. Leave a message a nd I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.” When we say we’re going to “get bac k to someone” we mean we are going to call them back. We are going to return  their call. So, if you call, leave me a message. I will call you back. I will get back  to you. We could use that expression “to get back to” for a phone call, for a n email, for a personal meeting. Someone in your office says to you, “Please get bac k to me about this project.” You can go and talk to them face to face. So, any o f those could be used with “get back to you.”  

Well, Amanda wasn’t home or she was “screening her calls.” “To screen” (screen) – “to screen your calls” means that you’re  there and you hear the answering machine and you can hear the voice of the  person, but you don’t pick up the phone because, maybe, you don’t have time or  you don’t want to talk to that person – that is to “screen” your calls. And m any people don’t like when other people they’re trying to call, screen their c alls. But I think it’s pretty common. You can only do this with an answering mach ine, however, if it is a voicemail, an electronic recording, it’s not possib le to screen your calls. Although there is now a new way of seeing who is calling you  and we call that “Caller ID” or caller identification. “Caller” (caller) is a pe rson who is making the telephone call and you can get a special box that you hook up  to your telephone and as soon as someone calls, you will see their telephone  number and their name on the little screen so you can decide if you want to answer the call or not. Most cell phones – mobile phones – have this what’s called “C aller ID” feature. Now, because some people don’t like to have their inform ation on Caller ID, you can ask the telephone company to block your Caller ID i nformation. And so, for example, on my home phone, if I were to call you – if I call you on my phone at home, I have “Caller ID.” I have Caller ID blocking , so nothing would come up on the little machine.  

Well, this is almost like a war between people beca use now the telephone companies here in the United States have a service – an option – that you will not accept calls for people who block their caller ID. So, if you call, for example, my brother and because I have Caller ID blocking, I  don’t want him to see who I am, he has a service which will block my call. So, when I call him I get an automatic message that says, “This caller does not accept blocked calls.” And so, I have to press a special number to unblock my calls. Well, anyway that’s Caller ID and Caller ID blocking and blocking the C aller ID blocking. It’s very  

interesting. People are, of course, concerned about  their privacy. Their “privacy” (privacy) means keeping your things private – secre t – so no one else knows.  

Well, Amanda wasn’t home, as I said before, and so the person in our story decides to call another friend, Celia. Celia is a w oman and the phone rang about six times and then her voicemail picked up or answe red. And you hear the outgoing message. “This is the voicemail for Cecili a. Leave a message after the long beep.” So, the message begins with identifying  who this is. This is the voicemail for Cecilia. Notice she doesn’t give her last name. Many people don’t like to give too much information on their outgoing  message. Some people do not even say their name. Some people have messages that  say, “Please leave a message after the beep,” or here, “Leave me a messa ge after the long beep.” A “beep” (beep) is the sound that you hear after or r ather before you leave your message. So, you’ll hear someone say, “Please leave  a message after the beep.” You’ll hear that sound and then you leave a message. And that’s very common to hear that on outgoing voice messages.  

The message also says that you can try her cell pho ne, Celia’s cell phone, and gives the cell phone number. That’s also common for  people to give you another telephone number. Notice that the telephone number in our story has an area code which is three numbers. All parts of the Unite d States have a three number – what we call an area code (area) (code) – two wor ds. This one, 213, is the area code for downtown Los Angeles area. And then there’ s the seven number local number – this one was 555-1212. 555 is not a real t elephone number. So, if you are watching a television movie or a regular movie and you hear the person give a telephone number, usually they’ll give a number t hat is 555 which means it’s not a real number. It’s a fake or phony or false nu mber. And that’s because they don’t want to give real telephone numbers out. They  don’t want to use a real telephone number for a movie because then everyone would call that number. So, the voicemail for Celia ends with “Have a nice day.”  

Well, by this time, the person calling feels “disco uraged.” And “to be discouraged” means that you’re feeling frustrated, you’re feelin g sad, you’re trying to do something, and it’s not working. So, finally he cal ls his friend Leslie. And he says, “Hello.” Well, he calls Leslie and Leslie is at wor k but she is not in her office. So, her voicemail answers. Her voicemail picks up and i t says, “Hello you’ve reached the office of Leslie Munroe” – that’s another commo n, more formal way of having a voice – outgoing voice message. “You’ve reached” means this is the person you are calling – Leslie Munroe. So, you’ve reached  Jeff McQuillan from the Center for Educational Development. You’ve reached the office of Jeff McQuillan which sounds even more formal. In this message, it’ s again common in business when you call a business and a person is not there and you get their voicemail,  

they’ll tell you, “I’m in a meeting,” or “I’m talki ng to another client.” A “client” of course, is a customer – (client). In the voicemail,  Leslie says, “I’m sorry to miss your call” – means I’m sorry I wasn’t here when you  called. I missed it. Please stay on the line and leave a detailed message. “To stay on the line” means don’t hang up, wait. A “detailed message” would be a mess age which has your name, your telephone number and so forth. Leslie says tha t she will return this call as soon as she can. “To return the call,” of course, m eans the same as to get back to or to call back, but “return your call” – a litt le more formal or for a business situation. Well, the caller here leaves a message a nd Leslie calls him right back. “To call someone right back” – (right) back – means  to call them immediately, to call them right away. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech. 

[start of story] 

I got two tickets to a show at the last minute and I tried to find someone to go with me. First, I called Amanda. The phone rang and  rang and then her answering machine picked up. 

"Hi, I'm not in right now. Leave me a message and I 'll get back to you as soon as I can."  

Amanda wasn't home or she was screening her calls. I didn't want to leave a message and decided to try Celia. The phone rang ab out six times and then I heard, 

"This is the voicemail for Celia. Leave me a messag e after the long beep. Or, you can try my cell phone at 213-555-1212. Have a nice day."  

By this time, I was starting to feel discouraged. I  didn't want to go to the show by myself, so I tried one last time. I called Leslie a t work.  

"Hello, you've reached the office of Leslie Munroe.  I am in a meeting or with a client. I'm sorry to miss your call. Please stay on  the line and leave a detailed message. I will return your call as soon as I can. Thank you for calling."  

I decided to leave a message. Leslie called me righ t back and we made plans for the show. We had a great time.
