Let’s get started.  > I wanted to visit the National Museum, but when I arrived, it was closed.  Rudy:  Can you tell me the hours of operation for the Museum?  Guard:  It’s open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday.  It’s closed on Sunday.    Rudy:   Thanks.  I’ll be back tomorrow. --------- The next day, I arrived at the Museum at 10 a.m. and the same guard was there.    Rudy:  Hello, again.  Can you tell me if the Museum has any tours?    Guard:  The Museum has a self-guided tour.  You can get information at the ticket window.  Rudy:  Oh, thanks.  Do you know if I can use my flash to take photos in the Museum?  Guard:  You can take pictures, but flash photography is prohibited.  Food and drinks are prohibited, too.
