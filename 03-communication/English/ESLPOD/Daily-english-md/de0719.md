This episode is called “Eating Unhealthy Food,” foo d that would be bad for your health.  We’ll listen to a dialogue between Helen a nd Gabe about some unhealthy foods.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Helen:  So, what’s for lunch?

Gabe:  Since you were nice enough to spend your Sat urday morning helping me out, I’ll make sandwiches for lunch.  I know it doe sn’t sound like much, but I make a mean sandwich.

Helen:  That sounds good, but you’re not going to u se those cold cuts, are you?

Gabe:  I was.  Why?

Helen:  Those are processed meats made with additiv es and a lot of sodium – definitely not what you’d want to put into your bod y.

Gabe:  I eat these kinds of cold cuts all the time.

Helen:  You shouldn’t if you don’t want to eat a lo t saturated fat.

Gabe:  Okay, how about if I make us salads.

Helen:  Not with those greens.  Unless they’re orga nic, they’re full of pesticides and chemicals.

Gabe:  [sighs] All right, how about if I make us he althy smoothies?

Helen:  Only if you use only fresh fruit.  Bottled juices are full of high-fructose corn syrup.  Yuck!

Gabe:  I’ve got a great idea.

Helen:  What?

Gabe:  You pick the restaurant and I’ll buy you lun ch.

Helen:  I don’t want to put you to any trouble.

Gabe:  It’s no trouble at all.  [Said under his bre ath]  I’d do anything to get you out of my kitchen!

Helen begins our dialogue by asking Gabe, “So, what ’s for lunch?” meaning what are we going to eat for lunch.  Gabe says, “Since y ou were nice enough to spend your Saturday morning helping me out, I’ll make san dwiches for lunch.”  “To help someone out” means to help another person.  Here, “ out,” like in a lot of phrasal verbs, has more of a meaning of emphasis.  “To help  someone” and “to help them out” are really the same thing.  Often we use this when another person helps you do some job that you need to get done; th ey don’t have to but they decide to help you – they help you out.

Gabe is going to make sandwiches for lunch; he says , “I know it doesn’t sound like much, but I make a mean sandwich.”  The expres sion “to not sound like much” means to appear to be unimportant, not signif icant, no big deal.  Gabe says he makes a mean (mean) sandwich.  “Mean” isn’t  a kind of meat or something you put in the sandwich.  It’s an adjecti ve which normally is negative; “to be mean” means to be unkind, not nice.  But, it  has an informal use, which is that it is excellent, it is great.  So, when Gabe s ays he makes a mean sandwich, he means he makes a very good sandwich.  For some r eason, there are lots of words in English that have a negative meaning in the dictionary in their normal meanings, but for some reason have become positive in informal English.  These change every year; many of them are part of slang s o I won’t talk about them at length, but “mean” is an example of one that has be en around for many years.

Helen says, “That sounds good, but you’re not going  to use those cold cuts, are you?”  “Cold cuts” (cuts) are thin pieces of what w e would call “processed” meat, things like bologna, pastrami, turkey, roast beef, ham; all of these could be called “cold cuts” when you cut them in thin pieces and us e them for a sandwich.

 Gabe says, “I was (meaning I was going to use the c old cuts).  Why?”  Helen says, “Those are processed meats made with additive s and a lot of sodium.” “Processed meats” are meats that are somehow change d; it’s not the same as when it came out of the animal.  They have done som ething to it – added, subtracted, changed it somehow.  “Process” has a co uple of different meanings in English however; take a look at our Learning Gui de for some additional explanations.  Processed meats often have additives .  “To add” means to have more of something, so an “additive” is something th at is extra, something that is put in the food or some other substance in addition  to what normally goes in there.  It could be a chemical; it could be some ot her substance; it could be just something to change the color of the food.  “Sodium ” is another word for salt. Technically, it would be sodium chloride; in chemis try class you learn it as NaCl. There was a great line that my chemistry teacher in  high school taught us: “Little Johnny took a drink / But little Johnny is no more / ‘Cause what he thought was H2O / Was really H 2SO 4.”  This has nothing to do with sodium now that I r ealize it, but I love that little rhyme!  “H 2O” is water and “H 2SO 4” is sulfuric acid, which would kill you.  That’s why little Johnny, when he drank the H 2SO 4 is no more, because he’s dead.  For some reason, that’s the onl y thing I remember from my high school chemistry class!

Anyway, Helen says that you definitely do not want to put these processed meats into your body, meaning eat them.  Gabe says, “I ea t these kinds of cold cuts all the time.”  Helen says, “You shouldn’t if you don’t  want to eat a lot saturated fat.” “Saturated fat” is a type of fat that is solid, not  liquid, at room temperature, mostly found in animal products.  Saturated fat is thought  to be bad for your heart, among other things.  Helen says so if you don’t wan t saturated fat you should not eat cold cuts.

Gabe says, “Okay, how about if I make us salads.”  Helen says, “Not with those greens.”  “Greens” refer to vegetables – green vege tables, usually lettuce or spinach, perhaps kale; these are greens that you us e in a salad.  But Helen says, “Not with those greens.  Unless they’re organic, th ey’re full of pesticides and chemicals.”  “Organic,” in general, means grown wit hout using any artificial or man-made chemicals; it has more technical definitio ns depending on who you talk to.  Helen says that the greens are full of pe sticides and chemicals. “Pesticide” is a chemical used to kill bugs and ins ects and other living things that could hurt or damage the vegetables or other food t hat you are growing.  We call food that you grow to eat “crops” (crops) – not to be confused with “crap” (crap), which is what you can buy at McDonald’s!  Now, pest icides are supposed to kill insects, but some people think they also harm or ca n make humans sick. “Chemicals” is a general word for any substance, in  this case, created in a

laboratory by scientists for a particular purpose.  Again, it has a broader use, which we won’t talk about here.

Gabe sighs; he goes “ hhhha .”  “To sigh” is to breathe out through your mouth so that other people can hear you; “ hhhha ,” that’s to sigh.  Gabe sighs and says, “All right, how about if I make us healthy smoothies?”  A “smoothie” is a thick, cold drink made with fruit, ice, usually milk, some juic e – some fruit juice, sometimes with frozen yogurt or ice cream.  It’s a thick frui ty drink, you could call it.  Helen says, “Only if you use only fresh fruit.”  She says , “Bottled juices are full of high- fructose corn syrup.  Yuck!”  “High-fructose corn s yrup” is a sweet liquid made from corn that is used many times instead of sugar in processed foods.  It can be found in many different kinds of food.  Some people  think it’s bad for you, so that’s why Helen says, “Yuck!”  “Yuck” is a word we  use to mean it doesn’t taste very good; it’s not good for you to eat.

Gabe says, “I’ve got a great idea.”  Helen says, “W hat?”  Gabe says, “You pick the restaurant and I’ll buy you lunch.”  Helen says , “I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”  When you say you “don’t want to put (som eone) to any trouble” you mean you don’t want to create problems for them; yo u don’t want to create extra work for them.  Of course, Helen doesn’t want to ea t anything that Gabe is preparing, so Gabe says okay, well let’s go to a re staurant, and you pick the restaurant.  Helen is what we might call a “pain in  the butt.”  Gabe says, “It’s no trouble at all that,” but of course it is a trouble  and so he says under his breath, “I’d do anything to get you out of my kitchen!”  “T o say something under your breath” means to say it quietly to yourself so that  the other person can’t hear you or can’t hear exactly what you’re saying.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
