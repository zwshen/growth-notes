This episode is called “Introducing a Speaker.”  It is goi ng to use vocabulary you would hear when someone was going to introduce a presen ter, for example at a conference or at a presentation, usually a formal prese ntation.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please ?   

It is my great honor to introduce our guest speaker toda y.  Our speaker is actually a person who needs no introduction, since she is we ll known in our field as one of its great innovators.  Edwina Litton has been  called a revolutionary thinker by those in our field.  That’s because she has stri ved to bring attention to those issues that we believe are so important.   

Dr. Litton holds four advanced degrees and has an honor ary doctorate from Harward University.  In her much-anticipated speech today, she will address what she sees as the future of our field.   

Without further ado, please join me in welcoming Dr. Edwina Litton. 

[end of dialogue] 

I begin introducing the speaker by saying, “Ladies and Gen tlemen.”  This is a very formal expression we use for formal events.  If you are  trying to get people’s attention, if you are trying to get people to stop tal king and listen to you in a formal situation, say a business meeting, usually a large  meeting where there are  

 many people would say, “Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have  your attention, please?”  Your “attention” is what you are focusing on.  You want them to focus on you.  I continue by saying, once again using some forma l phrases, “It is my great honor to introduce our guest speaker today.”  An “ honor” (honor) is something that makes you feel proud, makes you feel respecte d; it’s a good thing, a pleasurable thing even.  The word “honor” ha s a couple of meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.  So I say, “It is my great honor,” a very high honor, if you wi ll, “to introduce our guest speaker.”  “To introduce (someone)” in this case means to tell someone or to tell a group of people about another person whom they are probably meeting for the first time.  So, you bring a friend of yours to a part y, and you meet someone that you know but that your friend does not, you would introd uce your friend to the other person there at the party.  In this case, I’m int roducing the speaker; I am saying this person, who you may not know is...and then I g ive a description.  The “guest speaker” is a person who is invited specifically to ta lk at an event: a meeting, a conference perhaps.   

I say, “Our speaker is actually a person who needs no intro duction.”  This expression, “to need no introduction,” means that he or she is very well known by other people, that everyone in the audience listening would already know this person.  It’s sort of a way of saying to the person you ar e very famous; it’s kind of a compliment to that person.  So I say, “Our speaker is a ctually a person who needs no introduction, since she is well known in our fiel d as one of its great innovators.”  “Our field” here means whatever area we a re working in or studying in.  My field when I was professor was applied linguisti cs; that was the area that that I studied and did research in.  The presenter here , the guest speaker, is well known in the field of the people at this meeting as on e of the great innovators. An “innovator” (innovator) is someone who is very creative,  someone who will take risks, someone who invents something new.  An innovator  is often the first person to find new ways of doing things or to do things for the first time. 

“Edwina Litton,” that’s the name of the guest speaker,  “has been called a revolutionary thinker by those in our field.”  A “revolut ionary thinker” means, in this case, someone who has many new ideas.  These ideas may b e surprising when you first hear them.  They have new ideas about th e way things should be done in the world, in particular whatever field we’re  talking about here.  So, a revolutionary thinker is someone who has very bold, perhaps controversial new ideas about something. 

I say that Edwina is a revolutionary thinker, “That’s beca use she has strived to bring attention to those issues that we believe are so i mportant.”  “To strive”  

 (strive) means to try to do something that is very difficul t, to do something that is not easy: “I’m going to strive to help all of the peopl e in the world learn English who want to learn English.”  It’s not easy; I’m going t o strive to do it, I’m going to put a lot of effort into it, I’m going to work very ha rd in order to accomplish this thing.  So, Edwina has strived to bring attention to ce rtain issues.  “To bring attention to (something)” means to make many people thi nk about something that perhaps they didn’t know before or that they would norm ally not think about, they would normally ignore.  This can be used in many differe nt ways.  You could say to your boss, “I’d like to bring to your attention (or ‘bring your attention to’) something that was in the newspaper this morning.”  You  are telling him about something that he or she probably doesn’t know, because t hey’re working instead of reading their newspaper at their desk.  So, maybe you should be working too!  But, the idea is that you are telling som eone something they didn’t know before.  Well, Edwina has strived to bring attenti on to certain issues – certain topics that this group believes are important.  I should point out it’s also possible to say “striven” here: she has “striven” (en) instea d of “strived” (ed). They both are acceptable in American English. 

“Dr. Litton,” I say, “holds four advanced degrees.”  An  “advanced degree” would be something like a master’s degree or a doctoral level d egree (a doctorate), any academic degree – any academic level of achievement that i s higher than your bachelor’s degree.  So you go to college, you study four ye ars, you get an undergraduate degree: your bachelor’s of arts or bache lor’s of science.  After that if you get an additional degree, that would be an ad vanced degree, one that is higher than the undergraduate degree.  A master’s of science, a master’s of art, a master’s of fine arts, a master’s of business administrat ion, a doctor of philosophy, a medical doctor, a doctor of law (a juris do ctor), all of these are advanced degrees.  Well, Dr. Litton has four, and one o f them is obviously a Ph.D., an MD, or some other doctorate.  She also has an  honorary doctorate from Harward University.  Harward University is kind of like  Harvard University; the biggest difference is the “w” in the middle of the  word.  “Honorary” is when you go to a university, typically at the end of the year ce remony called the commencement ceremony, when everyone who is graduating f rom the university will receive their degree – their piece of paper that  says that they have graduated, they have completed their work.  When you go  to these commencement exercises, as they’re called, these commencement ce remonies, they often have someone who is famous or who has done some thing great and they want to honor that person.  They want that person to receive some recognition and so they give them an honorary doctorate, universities do this.  So that person technically is now a doctor, although that’s not really true, but it is a way of honoring that person.      

 “In her much-anticipated speech today,” I continue, “she will address what she sees as the future of our field.”  Something that is “m uch anticipated” – “much- anticipated” in this case – is something that people have  been waiting for and looking forward to a long time.  In this speech – this t ime where she is going to stand up and tell you what she thinks, she will address wh at she sees as the future of our field.  “To address” here means to speak about a particular topic, to discuss a particular issue.  There are other meanings of th is word; you can find those in our Learning Guide. 

Finally I say, “Without further ado.”  “Without furthe r (or additional) ado.”  This is a formal phrase meaning that you are going to do someth ing right away; you’re not going to continue, in this case, your introduction; you ar e ending your introduction.  “Without further ado (ado), please jo in me in welcoming Dr. Edwina Litton.”  “To join (someone) in welcoming (someone el se)” means that typically you begin to clap your hands so the person feels welcome as the person comes up from their chair to talk to you.  “Join me in wel coming our guest today,” and every one will clap, and the person will feel welcome; t hey will feel like people want him or her to be there.  That’s the idea.   

And so without further ado, let’s listen to the dialog ue at a normal rate of speech.
