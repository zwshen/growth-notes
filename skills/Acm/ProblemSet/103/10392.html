<P align="justify">
One of the central ideas behind much cryptography is that factoring
large numbers is computationally intensive.  In this context one might
use a 100 digit number that was a product of two 50 digit prime
numbers.  Even with the fastest projected computers this factorization
will take hundreds of years.

<P align="justify">
You don't have those computers available, but if you are clever you
can still factor fairly large numbers.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Input</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify">
The input will be a sequence of integer values, one per line,
terminated by a negative number.  The numbers will fit in gcc's
<code>long long int</code> datatype.
You may assume that there will be
at most one factor more than 1000000. 

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>

<P align="justify">
Each positive number from the input must be factored and all factors
(other than 1) printed out.  The factors must be printed in ascending
order with 4 leading spaces preceding a left justified number, and
followed by a single blank line.
