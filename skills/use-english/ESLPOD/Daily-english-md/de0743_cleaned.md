This episode is a dialogue between Xavier and Sara;  it’s called “Writing a Story.” Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Xavier:  How’s your novel coming along? 

Sara:  It’s not.  I abandoned it for now.  I think I bit off more than I can chew. Now, I’m working on a short story. 

Xavier:  That sounds interesting.  Who are the main  characters? 

Sara:  I’m not sure yet.  Character development is really important so I need to give the characters themselves some serious thought . 

Xavier:  Okay, tell me about the general plot.  Is it an adventure, romance, horror story – what? 

Sara:  I haven’t decided that either. 

Xavier:  All right.  What about the setting?  Is it  going to be set in the U.S.? 

Sara:  Hmm, that’s still up in the air, too.  I’m t hinking of writing a period story, but I’m not sure what time period to choose.  That’ll h elp decide the actual setting. 

Xavier:  I’m guessing you haven’t decided the point  of view of the story either, whether it’ll be told in the first person or third person, am I right? 

Sara:  You are.  I know.  I have a lot to think abo ut.    

 Xavier:  You’ve definitely got your work cut out fo r you. 

Sara:  I know.  I’m just waiting for some inspirati on.   

Xavier:  Good luck with that.   

[end of dialogue] 

Our dialogue begins with Xavier saying to Sara, “Ho w’s your novel coming along?”  A “novel” is a long, fictional story, a st ory that is not true.  “To be coming along” means to be progressing.  So, Xavier is aski ng Sara how her novel is progressing.  Is it getting finished?  Sara says, “ It’s not (it’s not coming along).  I abandoned it for now.”  “To abandon” (abandon) mean s to give up on something completely.  Well, Sara has not given up on it comp letely, that’s why she says, “I abandoned it for now,” meaning maybe in the future she’ll come back to it.  She says, “I think I bit off more than I can chew.”  Th is is a common expression: “to bite off more than you can chew.”  “To bite” means to use your teeth to remove usually a piece of food.  For example, if you are e ating chicken and you are holding the piece of chicken by your two hands, you  might bite off a piece.  The difference between “to bite” and “to bite off” has to do with separating the piece with your mouth; you remove it completely from wher e it was.  You could bite something; you could bite your finger, but you woul dn’t be removing it from your hand – well, unless you bit it very strongly.  The expression here in the dialogue however is “I bit (bit) off.”  “Bit” is the irregul ar past tense for “bite.”  So, “I bit off more than I can chew.”  “To chew” is to use your te eth to break down food into smaller pieces so you can swallow it.  “To bite off  more than you can chew,” however, as an expression, means to try to do somet hing that you are not completely able to do or even capable of doing.  Sa ra says, “Now, I’m working on a short story,” which is also a work of fiction; a story, but not a long one that you would publish as a book. 

Xavier says, “That sounds interesting.  Who are the  main characters?”  A “character” in a novel is one of the people in the novel.  Sara says, “I’m not sure yet.  Character development is really important so I need to give the characters themselves some serious thought.”  “Character devel opment” is the way that a person in a novel, a play, a movie changes over tim e in the story itself.  Sara says she’s going to give this “some serious thought ” meaning she’s going to think about it seriously for a long time.  Xavier says, “ Okay, tell me about the general plot.”  A “plot” (plot) is the main events in a nov el, play, or movie; we might call it the main storyline.  First this happens, then this happens, then this happens.   

Boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl get married.  That’s the basic plot for a lot of romantic movies and books.   

Xavier wants to know about the general plot of Sara ’s book, so he gives her some examples, some kinds of books, what we would c all some “genres”: adventure, romance, horror story.  He asks which of  these his friend’s story is. Well, an “adventure story” is a story that is excit ing; there are many usually dangerous activities or experiences in the story.  You can think of a movie like Indiana Jones , the series of movies, those were adventure movies .  “Romance” is boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy a nd girl get married; that’s the general idea of a romance story usually.  “Horror s tory” (horror) is a novel or a movie that has something scary or frightening.  The  Silence of the Lambs  was kind of a horror movie.  Usually, horror movies hav e a lot of blood nowadays, movies with people who get their heads cut off, and  that sort of thing.  I don’t really like horror stories.  I like adventures.  Ro mance, eh, not so much. 

Sara says, “I haven’t decided that either,” meaning  she doesn’t know what kind of story she’s going to write.  Xavier says, “All righ t.  What about the setting?  Is it going to be set in the U.S.?”  The “setting” of a s tory has to do with the time and the place where the story takes place, the location  and the period of time.  Is it in the 1980s in England?  Is it in Scotland in the 140 0s?  What’s the setting?  The question that Xavier asks is “Is it going to be set  in the U.S.?” meaning is it going to take place in the United States. 

Sara says, “Um, that’s still up in the air, too.”  When we say something is “up in the air” we mean it’s undecided, we’re not sure yet , we haven’t determined that yet.  Someone may say, “Our plans are up the air, w e don’t know what we’re going to be doing tomorrow.”  Perhaps we’ll be in a  beautiful balloon!  Sara doesn’t know what her setting is going to be.  She says, “I’m thinking of writing a period story, but I’m not sure what time period to choose.”  A “period story” is a story that takes place at some time in the past; it ’s not a story about what’s happening today.  It might be about England in the 19 th  century or Rome at the time of Julius Caesar; those would be period storie s, or period pieces they might be called.   

Sara isn’t sure what period she’s going to write in .  She says, “That will help decide the actual setting.”  Xavier says, “I’m gues sing you haven’t decided the point of view of the story either, whether it’ll be  told in the first person or third person, am I right?”  The “point of view” is the vi ew or perspective from which a story can be told.  Usually a story is told either in the first person, meaning you read the story from someone’s viewpoint; they say “ I.”  “I walked into a room and I saw a beautiful woman and I said, ‘Can I have you r phone number?’ and she  

said, ‘No.  Get out of here.  You’re ugly!’”  That would be a first person story. That’s kind of what my romance story would probably  be!  A third person story is the story being told not by one of the characters i n the book, but, if you will, by some person outside of the book.  “He walked into t he room, he saw a beautiful woman.  He said, ‘Hey baby.  How ya doing?’”  That would be a third person story.  That would never happen to me!  So, first p erson is “I,” a character is telling the story from their own perspective – thei r own point of view.  Third person is someone else’s point of view.  The story that Sara is writing is still undetermined in terms of its point of view.  She sa ys, “You are,” you are right, I don’t know.  “I know I have a lot to think about,” she says.   

Xavier says, “You definitely got your work cut out for you.”  “To have your work cut out for you” means to be required to complete s omething that is going to be very difficult; you have a very difficult task, a v ery difficult problem to solve.  Sara says, “I know.  I’m just waiting for some inspirati on.”  “Inspiration” is something that occurs to you that stimulates your mind to do or to feel something.  When we talk about creative people – artists, writers, pain ters – sometimes they’ll talk about their inspiration.  A man may paint a picture  of a beautiful woman; he was inspired by some woman in his life perhaps.  Sara i s waiting for some inspiration. Xavier says, “Good luck with that.”  That’s kind of  a comical expression nowadays.  When someone says, “Oh, good luck with t hat,” they mean you probably won’t be able to do that, or I doubt you w ill be able to do that. 

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed.
