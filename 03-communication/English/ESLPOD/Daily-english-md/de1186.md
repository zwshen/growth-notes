This episode is a dialogue about being in a severe or serious storm. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Shana: Hey, did you hear that? There’s a severe sto rm coming. Let’s hope for the best.

Aecio: Yeah, I hope it doesn’t leave a lot of damag e. We haven’t recovered from the aftermath of the last big storm.

Shana: No, when I said I was hoping for the best, I  meant I’m hoping to catch it on film. The weather forecaster says that their rad ar has detected a big cyclone forming over this area.

Aecio: Let me get this straight. You’re hoping for a big storm?

Shana: Yeah, I’m a storm chaser. I’ve captured lots  of tropical storms on film, and even a small tornado, but never a hurricane or typhoon.

Aecio: You mean you actually chase after storms?

Shana: Yeah, it’s fun. I hope one day to be there f or a really big one and somehow get into the eye where it’s calm.

Aecio: You understand that with big storms come str ong winds and floods, resulting in the destruction of homes and general c haos.

Shana: I don’t want anyone to get hurt. I’m just lo oking for a thrill.

 Aecio: Right, just a little harmless fun!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Shana asking Aecio, “Hey d id you hear that? There’s a severe storm coming.” Anything that is “severe” (se vere) is serious or, in this case, very strong. A “severe storm” (storm) would b e a serious weather event, often one that comes with strong winds and heavy ra in, although you could also have a “severe snowstorm,” where you get a lot of s now in a short period of time. Shana says, “Let’s hope for the best,” meaning let’ s hope things don’t get too bad.

Aecio says, “Yeah, I hope it doesn’t leave a lot of  damage,” meaning I hope the storm doesn’t cause too much harm – doesn’t, for ex ample, cause any houses to fall down or any buildings to lose their roofs. He says, “We haven’t recovered from the aftermath of the last big storm.” “Afterma th” (aftermath) is what happens after something else, usually the bad things or neg ative consequences of something. The “aftermath of a storm” would be what  happens after there’s a big storm. “In the aftermath of the big storm, the pric e of gasoline went up because it wasn’t easy to get gasoline in that area.”

Shana says, “No, when I said I was hoping for the b est, I meant I’m hoping to catch it on film.” “To catch it” means to be able to video the event or to use your camera to make a movie of it. She says, “The weathe r forecaster says that their radar has detected a big cyclone forming over this area.” A “weather forecaster” (forecaster) is a person who tries to predict what the weather will be in the future, which is always a very difficult thing to do.

“Radar” (radar) is a technology that allows a machi ne to detect the speed of things that cannot be seen by your eyes or that can not easily be observed or noticed. In an airport, they use radar to keep trac k of all of the airplanes that are flying in out of the airport to make sure that they  don’t hit each other. Radar can also be used to see where the clouds are and where it is raining. The weather forecaster uses radar to try to figure out what the  weather will be in the near future.

In the dialogue, Shana says the weather forecaster’ s radar “has detected a big cyclone.” “To detect” (detect) means to see, notice , or observe something that would not otherwise be seen. The radar has detected  – or noticed or seen or indicated on its screen – “a big cyclone” (cyclone) . A “cyclone”is a kind of storm that has winds that go around in a circle. Usually we use this word “cyclone” to

refer to a “tropical storm” – a storm that is comin g off from the ocean onto the land.

When cyclone refers to a tropical storm, it’s usual ly called a “hurricane” if it is in the Atlantic Ocean and a “typhoon”(typhoon) if it is in the Western Pacific or Indian Oceans. Aecio says, “Let me get this straigh t, you’re hoping for a big storm?” The expression “to get something straight” (straight) means to understand something completely. Usually we use this expression when someone is explaining something to you and perhaps at first you’re not really clear about what that person is saying, and so you want to repeat what the person is saying in your own words to make sure you  really understand it.

It may also be used when you are so surprised by so mething that someone is telling you that you can’t really believe it’s true , and so you’re repeating it or you’re summarizing it so that you’re sure you under stand it. In this case, Aecio is surprised that Shana actually wants there to be a b ig storm. That’s why he says, “Let me get this straight, you’re hoping for a big storm?” Shana says, “Yeah, I’m a storm chaser.”

Someone who “chases” (chases) someone is someone wh o goes after another person, who tries to catch another person. A “storm  chaser” (chaser) is a person who follows storms, usually to take videos of them or photographs of the storm. There are some people who like to chase “tornadoes”  (tornadoes). A “tornado” is a storm that has clouds that move quickly in a circ le, in what is called a “funnel” (funnel) which is a cone-like shape. You have torna does over land that are usually only going to last a certain amount of time . It’s not like a cyclone. A cyclone is a larger storm that can last for days.

Shana says she’s a storm chaser. She says, “I’ve ca ptured lots of tropical storms on film, and even a small tornado, but never a hurr icane or typhoon.” Shana says that she has been able to make a video of tropical storms and even a small tornado, but never a “hurricane” (hurricane) or typ hoon. Remember, a “hurricane” is a cyclone that is in the Atlantic Ocean. A “typh oon” is a cyclone in the Indian or Pacific Oceans.

In the United States, we used to give hurricanes, s torms coming out of the Atlantic Ocean, names of women. But more recently, they’ve started giving men’s names to hurricanes as well because men want to be equal to women when it comes to storms, I guess. I don’t know. Typhoons are also given names, but there the system is much more complicated. It isn’t  just the name of a man or woman.

Back to our story, Aecio says, “You mean you actual ly chase after storms?” Shana says, “Yeah, it’s fun. I hope one day to be there for a really big one and somehow get into the eye where it’s calm.” The “eye ” of a cyclone is the central part of the hurricane or a typhoon where the wind is moving around you. You’re in the middle of where the wind is moving. Apparent ly, in the eye of a cyclone, it is “calm” (calm), meaning there aren’t any strong w inds.

Aecio says, “You understand that with big storms co me strong winds and floods resulting in the destruction of homes and general c haos.” Aecio is reminding Shana that these large storms cause a lot of proble ms. They have strong winds – that is, strong movement of air – and can also caus e “floods” (floods). A “flood” is when the water in a river goes on to the surroundin g land where it doesn’t normally go. This results in the “destruction (dest ruction) of homes.”

“Destruction” comes from the verb “to destroy” (des troy), which means to cause damage to something so that it no longer exists or it no longer has the same shape or form. If you destroy a home, you take the walls down so that the home is no longer standing. You can no longer use it. “C haos” (chaos) refers to confusion or disorder. These storms can cause “gene ral chaos,” meaning lots of problems in a certain area.

Shana says, “I don’t want anyone to get hurt. I’m j ust looking for a thrill.” A “thrill” (thrill) is a feeling of excitement. It’s something  that is pleasurable because perhaps it’s a little dangerous and you like a litt le danger. A thrill can simply be, however, something that is very exciting. It doesn’ t have to be dangerous. But the thrill that Shana is seeking is definitely a da ngerous one, not only to her but to other people.

That’s why Aecio at the end says, “Right, just a li ttle harmless fun!” Something that is “harmless” (harmless) is something that wil l not cause problems, something that will not cause harm. Aecio is being sarcastic here. He’s making a joke. He’s saying that these storms cause a lot of problems and that you shouldn’t hope for a big storm because the storm co uld cause destruction of houses and general chaos, which would not be a good  thing.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Shana: Hey, did you hear that? There’s a severe sto rm coming. Let’s hope for the best.

Aecio: Yeah, I hope it doesn’t leave a lot of damag e. We haven’t recovered from the aftermath of the last big storm.

Shana: No, when I said I was hoping for the best, I  meant I’m hoping to catch it on film. The weather forecaster says that their rad ar has detected a big cyclone forming over this area.

Aecio: Let me get this straight. You’re hoping for a big storm?

Shana: Yeah, I’m a storm chaser. I’ve captured lots  of tropical storms on film, and even a small tornado, but never a hurricane or typhoon.

Aecio: You mean you actually chase after storms?

Shana: Yeah, it’s fun. I hope one day to be there f or a really big one and somehow get into the eye where it’s calm.

Aecio: You understand that with big storms come str ong winds and floods, resulting in the destruction of homes and general c haos.
