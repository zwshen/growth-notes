This episode is called “Playing Video Games.”  Let's get started.  > Achim:  Check out this new game I just got!    Marcia:  Let me see.  Oh, it’s a fighting game.  I’m not into those.  I like role-playing or simulation games a lot better.  Achim:  This isn’t just a fighting game.  You have to use strategy for each mission.  Check out these amazing graphics!  Marcia:  I can’t play that at my house.  I have a different console.    Achim:  Yes, you can.  It’s multiplatform.  Look at the box.  It says that you can use a joystick as your navigation system or a keyboard and mouse.    Marcia:  You know, right now I’m really into retro games.    Achim:  You mean last year’s games?  Marcia:  No, I mean really old school games, like the ones my parents used to play.  Achim:  You mean like Pac-Man and Pong?!  Marcia:  Yeah, exactly.  They’re classic and a lot less violent.
