[start of dialogue]

Pharmacist:  Can I help you?

Sanaz:  Yes, I had some questions for the pharmacis t.

Pharmacist:  I’m the pharmacist.  How can I help yo u?

Sanaz:  Can I fill these prescriptions here?

Pharmacist:  Yes, you can.  Just give those to the pharmacy technician and she’ll take care of you.

Sanaz:  The reason I ask is that I’m hoping there’s  a home remedy for my problems so I don’t have to pay for prescription me dication.

Pharmacist:  If you’ve already seen a doctor, then I would follow his or her instructions on what to do, including taking these medications.

Sanaz:  All right, but I have some other problems.

Pharmacist:  Like what?

Sanaz:  I have a rash on my arm.  See?  Is there an  over-the-counter medication I can use?

 Pharmacist:  That doesn’t look too serious.  You ca n find medications for rashes on aisle three.  I would recommend a cream made by McQ Pharmaceuticals. Use it for a few days and monitor it to see if it i mproves.  If not, you may want to see your doctor about it.

Sanaz:  Okay, thanks.  I also have allergies.

Pharmacist:  There are several drugstore medication s for allergies.

Sanaz:  I already take those.  What I want to know is if there is something I can do about the headaches I get from the allergies?

Pharmacist:  Pain relievers are on aisle four.  Let  me show you where they are.

Sanaz:  Oh, thank you.  On the way there, I’ll tell  you about my other health problems.  I need eye drops for my dry eyes, pills for my insomnia, something for my back pain…

We begin with the pharmacist saying to Sanaz, “Can I help you?”  Sanaz says, “Yes, I have some questions for the pharmacist.”  T he “pharmacist” is the person who is in charge of or runs the pharmacy or drugsto re.  A pharmacist has to go to school to get a degree, and must have a license in the particular state to be a pharmacist.  They are the ones who prepare medicine s and make sure that you’re getting the right medicine.

The pharmacist says, “I’m the pharmacist.  How can I help you?”  Sanaz says, “Can I fill these prescriptions here?”  A “prescrip tion” (prescription) is the doctor’s written – usually – permission for you to receive a  certain drug.  It used to be that in order to get a drug from a pharmacist – a specia l drug, a drug that required permission – you had to have a written note from the doctor that would give you that permission, and you would take that note to the pharmacy.  Now, much of this is done on the computer – electronically, but they still have paper prescriptions.  The “prescription” is the piece of paper that has the doctor’s signature on it.  Notice that Sanaz uses the verb “ fill.”  “Filling a prescription” means getting the drug that the prescription says y ou can have.

The pharmacist says, “Yes, you can,” you can fill t hese prescriptions here.  She says, “Just give those to the pharmacy technician a nd she’ll take care of you.” The “pharmacy technician” is someone who works for the pharmacist, who is not

a pharmacist themselves.  They are the people who d o the actual taking of the prescription, putting it into the computer, looking  for the drug, and so forth. “Technician” here really means assistant.

Sanaz says, “The reason I ask is that I’m hoping th ere’s a home remedy for my problems so I don’t have to pay for prescription me dication.”  A “home remedy” (remedy) is when you have some sort of medical prob lem – you’re sick – and you want to cure your problem, you want to get yourself  better not by taking some sort of drug from the pharmacy, but perhaps drinkin g some kind of tea or taking some other sort of vitamin that might help you; the se would all be home remedies.  In the United States traditionally if yo u have a cold we would say the home remedy would be chicken soup.  If you eat chic ken soup you will feel better.  I don’t think it will actually help your c old, but maybe.  That’s an example of a home remedy.  “Medication” is usually somethin g that is from a pharmacy.  It is a “drug” – that’s another word for “medication,”  or simply “medicine.”  All of those mean the same thing: “medicine,” “medication, ” “drug.”  Sanaz doesn’t want to pay for the prescription medication, the dr ugs that the doctor told him to take.

The pharmacist says, “If you’ve already seen a doct or” – notice again the verb, “to see a doctor” means to go to and be examined by  and talk to a doctor – “then,” she says, “I would follow his or her instru ctions on what to do, including taking these medications.”  In the United States, t he pharmacist isn’t going to change the orders of the doctor, or probably won’t say something to you that would be different than what your doctor would say;  that’s not their job.

Sanaz says, “All right, but I have some other probl ems.”  The pharmacist asks, “Like what?”  And here, the pharmacist might be abl e to help you with things that you did not discuss with your doctor, although agai n, it depends on what you ask him or her.  If your problem is that you’re ugly an d you want a new face, well, the pharmacist probably can’t help you with that.  Well , that’s not exactly what Sanaz is talking about here, although he might be ugly; I  don’t know; I’ve never met him.

Sanaz says, “I have some other problems,” and the p harmacist asks, “Like what?”  What are they?  Sanaz says, “I have a rash on my arm.  See?”  A “rash” (rash) is a red bump or a bunch of little red bumps  on your skin.  They often itch; they often give you this sensation that makes you want to scratch them with your fingers, for example.  That’s a rash.  A rash can b e caused by many different things.

Sanaz says, “Is there an over-the-counter medicatio n I can use?”  The term “over-the-counter” (counter) refers to drugs that y ou can buy in the pharmacy

without a prescription; you don’t need the doctor’s  approval to buy this drug.  So if you want aspirin, for example, you don’t need a prescription; you can just go to the pharmacy and buy aspirin.  That’s an example of  an over-the-counter medication; sometimes you’ll see the initials O.T.C .  “O.T.C.” stands for over-the- counter.

The pharmacist says that the rash that Sanaz has do esn’t look too serious.  She says, “You can find medications (again, medicine) f or rashes on aisle three.” “Aisle” (aisle) is just a section in the store.  Mo st stores put their products, the things they’re selling, on shelves, and you walk in  between the shelves up and down to find what you need.  Well, those spaces bet ween shelves are called “aisles” – or I guess the whole thing could be call ed an “aisle.”

In any case, the pharmacist tells Sanaz he can go t o aisle number three.  She says, “I would recommend a cream made by McQ Pharma ceuticals.”  A “cream” here means a lotion; that is, a thick substance tha t you rub on your skin.  Creams can be for lots of different things.  Women often p ut creams on their faces to make them more beautiful.  I don’t know; I’m pretty  ugly; I don’t think there are any creams I could use.  But, Sanaz could get a cre am for his rash to help it. The pharmacist recommends getting a cream made by a  certain company – a certain pharmaceutical company.  The word “pharmace utical” sounds like “pharmacy” or “pharmacist.”  It comes from the same  “root,” we would say, the same basic word.  It just means a company that make s drugs – that makes medicines.  The pharmacist says, “Use it for a few days and monitor it to see if it improves.”  “Monitor” here means to observe, to wat ch.  “Monitor” has some other meanings in English, as well.  Take a look at  our Learning Guide for those.

So, the pharmacist tells Sanaz to monitor his rash,  to keep looking at it to see if it gets any better.  “If not” she says, “you may want to see your doctor about it.” Sanaz says, “Okay, thanks.”  Then he says, “I also have allergies.”  “Allergies” (allergies) – the singular is “allergy,” with a “y”  at the end – is when your body reacts to certain substances.  It could be somethin g in the air, it could be something you eat, it could be something you touch with your skin.  I have allergies, for example, which cause my nose to get stuffed up; that is, it gets a certain liquid and then I find it hard to talk.  Th at’s why my voice sometimes sounds a little weird when I record these podcasts,  because sometimes I have allergies.

The pharmacist says, “There are several drugstore m edications for allergies.” “Drugstore” is just another word for pharmacy.  Her e, the pharmacist is really saying there are other over-the-counter medications  for that.  Then Sanaz says, “I already take those.  What I want to know is if t here is something I can do about

the headaches I get from the allergies?”  A “headac he” is when you have a pain in your head – or wherever your brain is.  Some peo ple’s brain is in the opposite part of their body!  But, Sanaz has a headache.  the pharmacist recommends pain relievers.  “Pain relievers” are medicines tha t – you guessed it – can reduce or relieve your pain so that it doesn’t hurt as muc h.  Aspirin is an example of a pain reliever.

The pharmacist says, “Let me show you where they ar e.”  Sanaz says, “Oh, thank you.  On the way there (meaning as we’re walk ing to that part of the store), I’ll tell you about my other health problems.  I ne ed eye drops for my dry eyes, pills for my insomnia, something for my back pain…”  and there the dialogue ends.  We assume that Sanaz has many other health p roblems.  When you have “dry eyes,” you have eyes that feel itchy, that nee d some liquid.  “Eye drops” is the liquid that you put in your eyes when they’re d ry.  “Insomnia” (insomnia) is when you can’t fall asleep at night; you’re not abl e to fall asleep easily.  Usually, a “pill” is a small, round thing that you take.  No tice again the verb, you “take” a pill; you put it in your mouth and you swallow it.  That’s one way of getting medicine into your body, through a pill.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
