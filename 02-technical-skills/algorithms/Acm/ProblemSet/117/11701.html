<h2>Problem C: Cantor</h2>

<img src="p11701.jpg" align="right"/>

The ternary expansion of a number is that number written in base 3.
A number can have more than one ternary expansion. A ternary
expansion is indicated with a subscript 3.
For example, 1 = 1<sub>3</sub> = 0.222...<sub>3</sub>,
and 0.875 = 0.212121...<sub>3</sub>.
<p>
The Cantor set is defined as the real numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive
that have a ternary expansion that does not contain a 1. If a number
has more than one ternary expansion, it is enough for a single one
to not contain a 1.
<p>
For example, 0 = 0.000...<sub>3</sub> and 1 = 0.222...<sub>3</sub>,
so they are in the Cantor set. But 0.875 = 0.212121...<sub>3</sub> and this
is its only ternary expansion, so it is not in the Cantor set.
<p>
Your task is to determine whether a given number is in the Cantor set.

<h3>Input Specification</h3>
The input consists of several test cases.
<p>
Each test case consists of a single line containing a number <i>x</i>
written in decimal notation, with 0 &lt;= <i>x</i> &lt;= 1, and having
at most 6 digits after the decimal point.
<p>
The last line of input is <tt>END</tt>. This is not a test case.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
0
1
0.875
END
</pre>

<h3>Output Specification</h3>
For each test case, output <tt>MEMBER</tt> if <i>x</i> is in the Cantor
set, and <tt>NON-MEMBER</tt> if <i>x</i> is not in the Cantor set.

<h3>Output for Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
MEMBER
MEMBER
NON-MEMBER
