On this episode, we have a dialogue between the Cel este and Anwar about getting things in the mail – the old kind of mail, you know, not email. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Celeste: Did the mail come?

Anwar: Yes, you got some letters and a package.

Celeste: Oh, I hope that one of those envelopes has  the photos Naomi promised us. Did you notice the postmark?

Anwar: No, but they’re sitting in the hall.

Celeste: Those photos are overdue and should have b een delivered days ago. Naomi thought she might not have put enough postage  on the envelope, but I thought it must have been misdelivered.

Anwar: You can look at it yourself. The package you  received was sent using overnight delivery.

Celeste: I wonder who sent it and why they sent it using expedited service.

Anwar: I don’t know. Why don’t you go look?

Celeste: I wonder if there’s anything perishable in  it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.

Anwar: I have no idea. There’s also a letter that’s  been forwarded from our old address that has delivery confirmation.

Celeste: Oh, I wonder what that could be.

Anwar: You know what?

Celeste: What?

Anwar: All of those mysteries can be solved if you just go and open your mail.

Celeste: I know, but isn’t it more fun to speculate ?

Celeste begins our dialogue by asking Anwar, “Did t he mail come?” Celeste is asking if the mail has arrived, if it has been deli vered. Anwar says, “Yes, you got some letters and packages.” A “letter” is usually a  piece of paper or several pieces of paper put in an envelope and then is give n to the local post office to be delivered to another location – another house or a business.

An “envelope” (envelope) is basically a folded piec e of paper that is glued together so that you can put another piece of paper , your letter, inside of it. You can put other things other than letters, pieces of paper with writing on them, in an envelope. You could also put a photograph in an env elope. Anwar says that Celeste got some letters and a package. The word “p ackage” (package) is usually used to describe a box (it could be a small  box, it could be a very large box) that is sent, again, through the mail – given to the post office or some other delivery service.

Here in the United States, in addition to the post office, we also have other private companies that will deliver your packages a nd letters. You have to pay more money, of course, for that to happen. Celeste says, “Oh, I hope one of those envelopes has the photos Naomi promised us.” Here we see the word “envelope” again, and in this case, the envelope ha s photos in it – or at least, that’s what Celeste hopes is in the envelope. Celes te says , “Did you notice the postmark?”

A “postmark” (postmark) is a little mark, usually m ade with ink, that is put on the package or the envelope when it is mailed. You put a little piece of paper called a “stamp” on the envelope or the package, and then the post office puts ink on that

stamp so that you don’t use the stamp again and so that you know what day the letter or the envelope was processed by the post of fice in order to be delivered.

In the United States, many times official documents  have to be mailed by a certain date, especially things you’re sending to t he government. The governmnet doesn’t require that the envelope arrive  by a certain date, but rather that it be postmarked by a certain date. So, to pay  your income taxes each year, you have to make sure that the envelope is given to  the post office and that the post office puts a postmark on it no later than Apr il 15th. We would say the envelope has to be “postmarked” by the 15th of Apri l. So, “postmark” can be used as a verb, or as a noun to refer to the actual  mark of ink on the envelope or package.

Celeste is asking Anwar if he noticed the postmark,  meaning if he looked at it. Anwar says, “No, but they’re sitting in the hall.” I should mention also that a postmark also usually contains the location of wher e the letter or package was mailed from – the location of the post office. Cele ste says, “Those photos are overdue and should have been delivered days ago.” I f something is “overdue” (overdue), it is past the deadline. It is something  that should have been submitted or should have arrived earlier.

“To be delivered” means to be given to the person f or whom the envelope or the package is intended. Celeste says, “Naomi thought s he might not have put enough postage on the envelope, but I thought it mu st have been misdelivered.” “Postage” (postage) is the amount of money that you  have to pay in order to send an envelope or a package. Usually this is done  with what are called “postage stamps” (stamps) which are those little pi eces of paper, with usually a picture on them of a famous person or of a famous p lace in your country, that are then placed on the envelope or the package.

Celeste thought the package might have been “misdel ivered,” meaning it might have been given to the wrong person by the post off ice. That happens of course sometimes. Anwar says, “You can look at it yourself . The package you received was sent using overnight delivery.” “Overnight deli very” is when you give a letter or a package to the post office or to another priva te delivery service, and that package or envelope is delivered the next day. In f act, another word for or term for “overnight delivery” is “next-day delivery,” wh ich is now the more common term.

Celeste says, “I wonder who sent it and why they se nt it using expedited service.” The word “expedite” (expedite) means to make someth ing go faster. So, “expedited service” would be delivery service that is faster than normal, faster

than usual. Anwar is clearly not interested in answ ering all of Celeste’s questions. He says, “I don’t know” – I don’t know w hy they sent it using expedited service. “Why don’t you go look?” meaning stop both ering me and go look at the package yourself. It’s almost certain that Anwar an d Celeste are married.

Celeste says, “I wonder if there is anything perish able in it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.” Sometimes you’ll use “expedited servi ce” or “overnight delivery” because you’re sending food that is “perishable” (p erishable). Perishable food is food that has to be put in a refrigerator or a free zer, otherwise, it will go bad. It will rot.

Some people send food that is perishable in special  packages that have ice in them or some other material that keeps them cold. B ut, of course, they need to be placed in a refrigerator or freezer as soon as p ossible. That’s “perishable food” – anything that has to be refrigerated or fro zen. The opposite would be “nonperishable food” – food that comes in cans, for  example.

Celeste also wonders whether the contents of the pa ckage is something that is “time-sensitive.” If something is “time-sensitive,”  it is required to be acted upon or to arrive within a very short period of time. Somet hing that’s time-sensitive is something that has to be done right away, or very s oon, or by a certain deadline. Again, Anwar isn’t interested in answering Celeste’ s questions. He says, “I have no idea. There is also a letter that’s been forward ed from our old address that has delivery confirmation.”

When mail is “forwarded” (forwarded), it is sent to  a different address, usually because someone has moved. If you move from one hou se or apartment to another house or apartment, usually the post office  will forward your mail to your new address even though the address on the envelope  or package is to your old address, to the house where you used to live. Usual ly they’ll do that for three or six months. After that, they may or may not, depend ing on how nice of a post office you have.

“Delivery confirmation” is a special service that t he post office provides, as well as other private delivery companies, where the pers on who is sending the package can check to see if the package has in fact  arrived – if it has been delivered. Celeste says, “Oh, I wonder what that co uld be?” meaning the other letter that had been forwarded. Anwar says, “You kn ow what?” And Celeste responds, “What?” Anwar says, “All of those mysteri es can be solved if you just go and open your mail.”

Anwar is getting impatient now with Celeste. He’s t elling her to just go and open the mail so she doesn’t have to keep asking questio ns wondering what’s in the package and the letter. A “mystery” (mystery) is so mething that you don’t know – something that you want to know, but you don’t have  an answer for. We can talk about a “murder mystery,” where you don’t know who killed a certain person.

Celeste says, “I know, but isn’t it more fun to spe culate?” She realizes she can have her questions answered by just going and openi ng these letters and packages, but she thinks it’s “fun to speculate.” “ To speculate” (speculate) means to wonder or guess about something without having a ny real evidence or proof. The noun form would be “speculation.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Celeste: Did the mail come?

Anwar: Yes, you got some letters and a package.

Celeste: Oh, I hope that one of those envelopes has  the photos Naomi promised us. Did you notice the postmark?

Anwar: No, but they’re sitting in the hall.

Celeste: Those photos are overdue and should have b een delivered days ago. Naomi thought she might not have put enough postage  on the envelope, but I thought it must have been misdelivered.

Anwar: You can look at it yourself. The package you  received was sent using overnight delivery.

Celeste: I wonder who sent it and why they sent it using expedited service.

Celeste: I wonder if there’s anything perishable in  it or that’s time-sensitive in some way.

Anwar: I have no idea. There’s also a letter that’s  been forwarded from our old address that has delivery confirmation.

 Celeste: Oh, I wonder what that could be.

Anwar: You know what?

Celeste: I know, but isn’t it more fun to speculate ?
