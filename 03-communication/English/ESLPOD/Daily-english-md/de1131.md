This episode is a dialogue between Lillian and Bruc e about going to an archaeological site – a place where we find out wha t people were like many, many years ago before we had Wikipedia. Let’s get s tarted.

[start of dialogue]

Lillian: Look at this! I’m going to take this home as a souvenir.

Bruce: You can’t do that. That might be an artifact  of some kind. It belongs to this archaeological site.

Lillian: It’s just a rock. No one will miss it.

Bruce: That’s not the point. Everything here should  be preserved. That’s the point of doing a careful excavation. Everything should be  recorded and nothing should be lost.

Lillian: Take it easy. It’s not like I’m defacing a nything. And if they’re trying to preserve this site, why are they doing this dig? Wo uldn’t it be better just to leave it frozen in time?

Bruce: The point is to learn more about the peoples  of ancient civilizations who lived here in prehistory.

Lillian: In my opinion, it’s disrespectful to distu rb burial mounds and tombs. They were never meant to be desecrated like this.

Bruce: Some people would agree with you, but that’s  the price we have to pay to add to our knowledge about human history. I really think you should leave that rock where you found it. It could be a fossil.

Lillian: Do you really think so?

Bruce: You never know. You could hold in your hand the key to understanding this entire civilization.

Lillian: Wow, if I take it, I could preserve it for  posterity.

Bruce: What happened to leaving things undisturbed?

Lillian: That’s before I realized I could go down in history for my own discovery!

[end of dialogue]

This dialogue is all about visiting, or going to, a n archaeological site. “Archaeological” (archaeological) is the study of h uman history by looking at what people many years ago left behind, things we usuall y find in the ground. To understand what life was like a thousand years ago or five thousand years ago, we dig into the ground. We make a hole or remove gr ound so we can see what is still there from these old civilizations.

The study of archaeology is the study of these old civilizations, the way people lived many years ago. Specifically, “archaeology” d eals with looking at what remains physically – what we can find, as I said be fore, usually buried in the ground. Lillian begins our dialogue by saying to Br uce, “Look at this! I’m going to take this home as a souvenir.” A “souvenir” (souven ir) is something you bring home from a place that you have visited.

Now of course, when you go to an archaeological sit e, you can’t bring a souvenir home. That’s usually not allowed. And that’s what B ruce tells Lillian. “You can’t do that. That might be an artifact of some kind.” A n “artifact” (artifact) is a word that we use to describe anything that was made by h uman beings many years ago and then is found. So, archaeological sites, or  areas where we are digging into the ground, find things, physical things that we call “artifacts.” Bruce says, “It belongs to this archaeological site.” The word “sit e” (site) just means place or location – where something is done.

Lillian says, however, “It’s just a rock. No one wi ll miss it,” meaning no one will even know it’s gone. Bruce says, however, “That’s n ot the point.” “That’s not the

point” means you don’t understand or you’re giving a reason that is not relevant here. He says, “Everything here should be preserved .” “To preserve” (preserve) means to take care of something so that it is saved  for the future. You take care of the condition of the object. The verb is “to pre serve.” The noun is “preservation.”

Bruce says, “That’s the point of,” or that’s the re ason for, “doing a careful excavation.” An “excavation” (excavation) is also s ometimes called a “dig” (dig). An “excavation” is a place where you dig into the g round. You remove the dirt and the rocks in order to see what’s underneath the m. You will normally only hear or read this word “excavation” relating to arc haeological sites. Bruce says, “Everything should be recorded and nothing should b e lost.” “To record” something here means to write it down, or perhaps to take a film of it.

Lillian says, “Take it easy,” meaning “Don’t get ex cited, Bruce.” “It’s not like I’m defacing anything,” she says. “To deface”(deface) s omething is to change the way something looks, usually by painting on it or p erhaps scratching it. If someone puts a sign up on a wall, for example, and you don’t like what the sign says, you could, say, take some paint and put a big  X on it. That would be “defacing” the sign. By the way, that’s usually ill egal – when you deface someone else’s property – so you should probably not do tha t.

Lillian continues, “And if they’re trying to preser ve this site, why are they doing this dig?” “Dig,” remember, means “excavation.” “Wo uldn’t it be better just to leave it frozen in time?” The phrase “frozen (froze n) in time” means not changing anything, or perhaps a situation that has been the same for many, many years. If you don’t dig it up, Lillian says, it will remain the same as it was before. Of course, the difficult part of archaeology is diggin g things up without ruining them.

Bruce says, “The point” – once again, the reason – “is to learn more about the peoples of ancient civilizations who lived here in prehistory.” “Ancient” (ancient) means very old, usually thousands of years old. “Ci vilization” refers to a society or group of people who live together with similar c ustoms, similar laws, and similar practices. The point of archaeology is to l earn about the peoples of ancient civilizations who lived in what we call “pr ehistory.” “Prehistory” (prehistory) is the period of time before human bei ngs began to write, before they began to record things so that they could be read l ater on.

Lillian says, “In my opinion, it’s disrespectful to  disturb burial mounds and tombs. They were never meant to be desecrated like this.” “To disturb” (disturb) can mean to bother or to interrupt someone. Here, it me ans to change something in a negative way. The word “burial” (burial) refers to putting a dead body into the

ground. A “mound” (mound) is basically a pile of di rt, an area that is higher than the ground or earth around it.

A “burial mound” is a place where someone is buried . Instead of digging in the ground and putting the body in the ground, in a hol e, you put dirt or earth over the body. Burial mounds were very common in many di fferent civilizations, including the Native American civilizations in the area where I grew up in Minnesota, where you can still see burial mounds fr om the ancient American- Indian civilizations.

“Tombs” (tombs) are also places where you put a dea d body, except usually it’s an area or a room instead of underground in a hole or in a burial mound. You can think of the ancient tombs in Egypt. These are plac es where you bury someone above the ground in a room or in a large area. Lill ian is saying that they should not be digging into these burial mounds and tombs.

She says, “They were never meant to be desecrated l ike this.” “To desecrate” (desecrate) means to treat something with disrespec t, especially something that you consider holy – something that has religious va lue or religious significance. Bruce continues, “Some people would agree with you,  but that’s the price we have to pay to add to our knowledge about human his tory. I really think you should leave that rock where you found it. It could  be a fossil.” A “fossil” (fossil) is a rock that contains the image of an animal or a pl ant that died many years ago.

Lillian says, “Do you really think so?” meaning do you really think this could be a fossil? Bruce says, “You never know” – you can neve r be sure. “You could hold in your hand the key to understanding this entire c ivilization.” Bruce means you could be holding in your hand right now a very impo rtant piece of information that would help us understand this civilization. Lillian  says, “Wow. If I take it, I could preserve it for posterity.” “Posterity” (posterity)  refers to future generations – people who have not even been born yet.

Lillian is still thinking of taking this rock with her. Bruce asks her, “What happened to leaving things undisturbed?” meaning “W hy did you change your mind about leaving things undisturbed, because now you’re talking about taking this rock with you.” Lillian says, “That’s before I  realized I could go down in history for my own discovery!”

The expression “to go down in history” means to be remembered for a particular accomplishment or to be remembered in a certain way . It could be a good way. It could be a bad way. Adolf Hitler will go down in hi story as being a very evil man a man who was responsible for killing millions of peo ple. Gandhi in India will be

remembered, or go down in history, for helping esta blish the independence of his country. I will go down in history as being one of the great singing podcasters of the twenty-first century. Hey, don’t laugh.

Lillian wants to go down in history for her own dis covery. “Discovery” comes from the verb “to discover” (discover), which means to l earn something about something else for the first time, before anyone el se has learned it. You could discover a cure for a disease – you could find the answer to help people get over their sickness. That would be a discovery.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
