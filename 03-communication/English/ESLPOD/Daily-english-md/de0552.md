This episode is a dialogue between Missy and Jonathan.  Th ey’re talking about people who are “applying for work” at their company, p eople who are asking to be hired as employees.  It’s going to go over a lot of different vocabulary related to interviews and job applications.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Missy:  Okay, let’s sort this stack of applications into three p iles: good candidates, those worth a second look, and definite “no’ s.” 

Jonathan:  Well, that didn’t take long.  With this poo r economy, I thought we’d get an embarrassment of riches, but these applications are pr etty pathetic.  I only see two of these people as employee material.   

Missy:  Yeah, well, it might have something to do with the salary we’re offering. Not everybody is willing to work for peanuts. 

Jonathan:  Isn’t that the truth!  Some of these applica nts have never held down a job before and don’t have a single reference.  These ot hers don’t seem to be able to hold on to a job, job-hopping every few mont hs.   

Missy:  Well, at least we have these two standouts.  They b oth have the right educational background and level of experience.  Should w e call them in for interviews? 

Jonathan:  Yeah, and I hope they haven’t already been snatched up by another company.    

 Missy:  You and me, both. 

[end of dialogue] 

Missy says to Jonathan, “Okay, let’s sort this stack of application s into three piles.”  “Let’s sort (let’s organize) this stack (stack) of ap plications.”  A “stack” is a large number of objects that are placed on top of each  other so that you have, vertically, several things on top of each other.  We talk a bout a stack of papers; we could refer to a stack of plates in the kitchen, one on  top of the other.  Missy’s talking about a stack of applications.  An “application” i s the written information that someone who is trying to get a job at your company f ills out, or completes, and gives to you; it gives you their basic information.  Missy wants to sort the stack of applications into three piles (piles).  A “pile”  is a group of things that are in the same place, either next to each other or on top of each other, but not very organized.  A stack would probably be considered organized,  but a pile would be things that would not be very neat.  Maybe some things ar e “crooked,” some things aren’t exactly on top of the other things.  That would be a pile of things.  I should mention that “stack” has a couple of different me anings in English besides this one; take a look at your Learning Guide for some a dditional definitions. 

So Missy wants to sort the applications into three piles: g ood candidates, those worth a second look, and definite “no’s.”  A “candidat e” is a person who wants to receive a particular position or get a particular job.  So, a job candidate would be somebody who wanted to work at your company.  A political candidate would be someone who wanted to have a certain political office: t he president, a senator, and so forth.  The expression “worth a second look” mean s that this person or this thing is good enough, has good enough qualities or  characteristics that you want to consider it a little more.  It may not be perf ect, but it’s good enough.  You say, “Okay, well, these are good candidates, definite ‘yes’ people.”  These are people who aren’t perfect, but we want to look at mo re closely again.  They’re worth a second look. 

Jonathan says, “Well, that didn’t take long.  With this poor economy, I thought we’d get an embarrassment of riches, but these applicati ons are pretty pathetic.” The expression “an embarrassment of riches” means you have to o much of a good thing, or you have too many good things to choose from.  He’s saying here that he thought they would get lots of good applicati ons, too many for them to choose from, but instead they got applications that were  pathetic (pathetic). Something that is “pathetic” is very sad; in this case, very disappointing.  It’s not good enough.  “Pathetic” is a very strong, very negative way of describing something.  Jonathan says, “I only see two of these people  as employee material.”  The word “material,” here, means somethi ng that is used in a  

 particular way for some particular purpose.  In this case,  these are people who might make good employees; they’re employee material.  “Material” has other meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some more detailed explanations of those. 

Missy says, “Yeah, well, it might have something to do with  the salary we’re offering (the amount of money that we will pay this p erson).  Not everybody is willing to work for peanuts.”  The expression “to work fo r peanuts” means to work for very little pay, to work at a very low paying job.  M issy is saying here that the reason they didn’t get a lot of good applications is tha t people don’t want to work for such a low salary. 

Jonathan says, “Isn’t that the truth (meaning I agree w ith you completely)!  Some of these applicants have never held down a job before.”  “To hold down a job” means to have and to keep a job for a long time, or at  least a reasonable amount of time – more than a week, let’s say.  My father once t old me that I could never hold down a job for more than two years, which is abou t right!  Jonathan says many of these applicants “don’t have a single reference.”   A “reference,” in this dialogue, means a person who is familiar with your work,  who knows you, and who is willing to give their opinion about you to the employer, to the person or the persons that are interviewing you.  For example, when I applied for a job at the university I needed to give them three references – three  is pretty common for U.S. jobs – and those could be my professors, they could be other people I worked with; they couldn’t be my wife or my mother.  You  don’t give your family members as references, although sometimes people will ask for a personal reference, and that will mean a friend who knows you ver y well.  But usually for a job you have professional references, people that you’ve wo rked with or worked for. 

Jonathan says, “These other applicants don’t seem to be ab le to hold on to a job, job-hopping every few months.”  “To hold on to a job” is to keep a job; it’s similar to “hold down a job.”  “To hold on to (anything)” me ans to keep it for a long time; so “to hold on to a job” means to keep the job for a l ong time.  “To hop” (hop) usually means to jump up a short distance in the air wh ile you’re going forward. We talk about a rabbit, the animal, who hops.  They g o up and down in the air as they are moving forward, instead of walking for example.   Well, “job-hopping” means jumping – going from one job to another freque ntly; every few months or every year you have a new job.  That would be job-hoppin g.  “Bar-hopping” would be going to different bars to have different drinks.  This is called a “pub crawl” (crawl) in England, but in the United States w e usually talk about bar- hopping.  But we’re not bar-hopping in this dialogue , we’re talking about people who are job-hopping.  

 Missy says, “Well, at least we have these two standouts.”  A “standout” (one word) is a person who is much better than everyone else, w ho’s obviously more qualified.  Missy says, “They both have the right educatio nal background,” meaning they have the right kind of education; they’ve st udied the right things for this job.  They also have the right level of experience; they’ve worked at this kind of job for a long time.  “Should we call them in fo r interviews?” meaning should we ask them to come to the office and meet with us forma lly so we can ask them questions in an interview. 

Jonathan says, “Yeah, and I hope they haven’t already be en snatched up by another company.”  “To snatch (snatch) up” is a phrasal verb meaning to grab, to get or use something very quickly before other people can  get it or use it.  After Christmas, on December 26th, all the big shopping stores – the shopping malls have sales, where they lower the price on things.  And pe ople get there very early – I mean ridiculously early, 5:00 in the morning, 4:00 in the morning – so they can get the good prices, because they want to snatch u p all of the good things at low prices before other people get there and  take them, before they don’t have any more left.   

So Jonathan is hoping that these two standouts have not b een snatched up – have not been already hired by another company.  Missy says, “You and me, both.”  “You and me, both” means that I completely a gree with you; I completely agree with what you said.  Notice grammatically it shoul d be “you and I,” but we don’t say “you and I”; the expression is “you and me, both .” 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
