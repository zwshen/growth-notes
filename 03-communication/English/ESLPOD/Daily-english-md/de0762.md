This episode is a dialogue about having dinner with  a large number of people. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

My roommate, Jim, invited me over to his house for a family meal.  I’m an only child, so I’m not used to a big family dinner.  I f elt like a fish out of water. …

Jim’s mother:  Sit down, everybody.  Dinner’s ready .

Phil:  Thank you for having me over, Mrs. Moreno.

Jim’s mother:  Don’t mention it.  Just sit down and  eat.  Jim, pass the potatoes, and Dana, don’t hog the peas.  Hand them both to Ph il.

Phil:  Thank you, Mrs. Moreno, but I’ve already tak en a helping of each dish.

Jim’s mother:  Then you need to have seconds.  You’ re too skinny.  Eat up!

Phil:  This food is really good, but I don’t think I have the appetite for more.  My plate is already overloaded.

Jim’s mother:  All right, no more potatoes or peas,  but you need more ham. Laura, serve Phil some more ham, and Jason, round u p some more rolls.

Phil:  No, no, please.  I really couldn’t eat more than what’s already on my plate.

Jim’s mother:  Don’t be ridiculous.  I know you’re saving room for dessert. There’s an apple pie, a strawberry shortcake, a che esecake, and some ice cream. …

I now know why Jim only comes home for meals every once in a while.  Eating like this more than once a week would give anybody a coronary!

Our story begins with Phil saying that his roommate , the person that he lives with, Jim, invited him over – invited him to his ho use for a family meal, a meal – a dinner with the other members of, in this case, Jim ’s family.  Phil says that he was, or is, an only child, meaning that his parents  only had one child, him, so he is not used to – he’s not familiar with a big famil y dinner.  He said, “I felt like a fish out of water.”  The expression “a fish out of water ” is used to describe someone who is very uncomfortable or in a situation that th ey are not used to being in, they are in a very different kind of environment than the one they are used to.  I grew up in a big family, so a big family meal would not make me uncomfortable.  But if I go to a house that has a very small family I migh t feel like a fish out of water. Fish, of course, normally are in water, and if they  go out of water, well, sometimes they die.  In fact, I think pretty often the fish will die out of water!

Well, Phil doesn’t die, but he does have an interes ting experience.  He goes to Jim’s house, and Jim’s mother says, “Sit down, ever ybody.  Dinner’s ready.”  We are ready to eat.  Phil says, “Thank you for having  me over, Mrs. Moreno.”  “To have (someone) over” means to have someone come to your house for a short time to visit and usually to eat.  Phil says, “Than k you for having me over, Mrs. Moreno.”  And Mrs. Moreno, who is, of course, Jim’s  mother, says, “Don’t mention it.”  We use this phrase “don’t mention it”  to mean sort of you’re welcome.  We’re saying that you don’t have to thank  me, it was nothing, it’s no big deal – don’t mention it.

She says, “Just sit down and eat.  Jim, pass the po tatoes, and Dana, don’t hog the peas.”  “To pass (something),” as a verb, in th is case means to take the dish that has the food and give it to the person usually  next to you so he or she can get food for themselves.  Although in some families , one person, often the mother, will put the food on the plate for everyone , it’s more common that you have all of the plates of food – all of the dishes on a large table and people pick them up and they give them to the person next to th em – they pass them to the person next to them.

Jim’s mother is telling him to pass the potatoes, a nd Dana, who we guess is her daughter, “Don’t hog (hog) the peas.”  “To hog” as a verb means to use all of something without having anyone else use it.  Or, t o take up all the time with something and not let anyone else have time with it .  Your parents might tell you not to hog the TV.  Or as parents, you may tell you r children, “You’re hogging the TV.  I want to watch something now.”  You’re spendi ng too much time with that and you’re not letting me do it.  Dana is hogging t he peas, meaning she’s not passing them to other people.  I think that’s what Jim’s mother means.  She also says, “Hand them both to Phil.”  “To hand (somethin g) to (someone)” means to give them that thing.  In this case, to give the po tatoes and the peas to Phil, who is, of course, the guest that they have invited ove r.

Phil says, “Thank you, Mrs. Moreno, but I’ve alread y taken a helping of each dish.”  A “helping,” as a noun, is a serving; it’s the amount of food that you take and put on your plate to eat.  That’s a helping (he lping).  You could have a large helping, you could have a small helping, depending on how much food you want to eat.  Phil has already taken a helping of the po tatoes and the peas, of each dish.  A “dish” is, in this case, a type of food th at has been prepared.  You could have potatoes and vegetables and meat, each of thos e would be a dish.  The word “dish,” as a noun, can also mean the plate tha t you are using to eat off of, or more commonly the container that the food is kep t in.  So you put all of the potatoes into a large bowl, we could say into a lar ge dish.  “Dish” has a couple of somewhat confusing meanings here.

Jim’s mother says, “Then you need to have seconds.”   “Seconds” (seconds) is a second helping, or additional food.  You’ve already  had some potatoes and your mother says, “You need to have seconds,” you need t o have even more potatoes, a second helping of potatoes.  Jim’s moth er thinks Phil needs to have seconds because he’s too skinny, he’s too thin.  Ki nd of like me!  Jim’s mother says, “Eat up!”  This expression – informal – “eat up” means go ahead and start eating, eat everything that we are giving you.  It’ s a phrase that is used to encourage people to eat more or to start eating.

Phil says, “This food is really good, but I don’t t hink I have the appetite for more.” “Appetite” (appetite) is your desire to eat food, o r how much food you want to eat right now.  If you say, “I have a big appetite,” th at means you are very hungry, you want to eat a lot of food.  If you don’t have m uch of an appetite, that means you’re not very hungry at all.  Phil says that he d oesn’t think he has the appetite for more food; he can’t eat any more.  He says, “My  plate is already overloaded.” “To be overloaded” means to have too much of someth ing, usually more than what the container can hold, or the plate can hold.   To be overloaded with food means to have too much food, more than you can eat.

 Jim’s mother says, “All right, no more potatoes or peas, but you need more ham.” “Ham,” of course, is a type of meat from a pig.  “L aura, serve Phil some more ham.”  “To serve (someone)” in this case means to p ut food on their plate.  “I will serve you,” I will put the food that you need on yo ur plate.  We talk about waiters and waitresses in restaurants as servers; they are the people who are serving you – who are giving you the food, or at least brin g it from the kitchen to your table.  Jim’s mother tells Laura to serve Phil some  more ham, and Jason is told to round up more rolls.  “To round up,” as a phrasa l verb, means to find something and bring it back.  Go out to the kitchen  or go to the store and round up some more milk or round up some more bread.  You  go and get more of that and you bring it back.  Jason is supposed to round up some more rolls.  “Rolls” are small pieces of bread that you eat with your me al.

Phil says, “No, no, please.  I really couldn’t eat more than what’s already on my plate.”  Phil says he can’t eat any more.  Jim’s mo ther says, “Don’t be ridiculous.” She’s saying don’t be silly, that’s not right.  “I know you’re saving room for dessert.”  “To save room for,” when we’re talking a bout eating, means not to eat too much because you want to also be able to eat so mething else that comes later, in this case dessert – the sweet.  Jim’s mot her says that Phil is saving room for dessert.  She says, “There’s an apple pie, a st rawberry shortcake, which is strawberries on top of a small, little cake; a chee secake, cake made out of cheese, of course; and some ice cream.

After the meal, Phil says, “I know now why Jim only  comes home for meals every once in a while.”  “Every once in a while” means oc casionally, not very often, not frequently.  “Eating like this more than once a wee k would give anybody a coronary!”  “Coronary” (coronary) here means a hear t attack.  It’s an informal term referring to when your heart stops beating.  I f you eat a lot of unhealthy food that may give you high cholesterol, which could eve ntually lead to you having a coronary or a heart attack, and that’s what Phil is  suggesting here.  Notice that Phil doesn’t thank Jim’s mother for all the work th at she has done making the meal.  Instead, he’s worried about a heart attack.  Well, too bad Phil!  Next time make your own meal!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
