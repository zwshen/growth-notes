This episode is about a boss and someone who works for him, talking about learning the rules and the procedures at a new job.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  I was happy to finally get a job, but I wasn’t ready for a first day of work like this one. …  Boss:  This is your first day and my job is to give you the rundown on how we do things around here.  This is a well-oiled machine.  Everybody has to pull his or her weight, or things don’t run smoothly.  Got that?    Olivia:  Yes, I do.  I’m here to learn and to get up to speed as quickly as possible.  Boss:  Good.  I expect you to know the drill and be able to fall in line by the end of the week.  Olivia:  I will do my very best.  Boss:  We don’t like surprises around here, so we’ve built our workday around a lot of routines that every employee follows.  We expect people to arrive at 8:30 on the nose.  That’s our start time and there is no leeway whatsoever.  If you’re habitually late, you’re out.  Got that?  Olivia:  Got it.
