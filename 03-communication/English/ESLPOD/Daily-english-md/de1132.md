In this episode, we’re going to talk about defendin g your ideas, or giving reasons for your ideas, when you’re at work. Let’s get star ted.

[start of dialogue]

Monica: That’s why I don’t think it’s doable. We sh ould consider other ideas. . . .

That was Monica. She’s my co-worker and my nemesis.  She criticizes all of my ideas, but I’ve learned that the best defense is to  not get defensive. . . .

Kazuya: I appreciate your feedback. I understand yo ur reservations, but let me show you these figures I’ve worked up, which I beli eve will address your concerns. . . .

I knew Monica would attack my ideas, so I had come prepared. . . .

Monica: That’s all very impressive, but I still thi nk we need to consider other options. . . .

Unfortunately, when Monica digs in her heels, I kno w that the only thing to do is to placate her. That plus a delaying tactic usually  works. . . .

Kazuya: Your comments have given me a lot to think about. We’re running short on time and we want to get to the other topics for discussion, so let’s come back to it next week. . . .

Luckily, I know something else about Monica: She ha s a short attention span. By next week, she’ll be on to her next victim!

We hear in this episode the voices of two different  people at work. In addition, we hear comments from one of those people – Kazuya. the story begins with Monica saying, “That’s why I don’t think it’s doabl e. We should consider other ideas.” Now, Monica is talking to Kazuya, and Kazuy a is going to talk to us, if you will, directly about the way that Monica is talking  to him.

Monica says that something that she and Kazuya are talking about is not doable. “Doable” (doable) comes from combining two words – “able” and “do.” Something that is “doable” is something that you can or are a ble to do. Another word we might use here is “feasible” (feasible). Something that is doable is something that can be done, something that is not too difficult.

Monica is telling Kazuya that whatever idea he has is not doable. Then we hear Kazuya giving his commentary, his view of what Moni ca is saying. He says, “That was Monica. She’s my co-worker and my nemesis.” A “ nemesis” (nemesis) is an enemy. It’s someone whom you can’t beat or win agai nst, someone who creates problems for you. Kazuya is probably using this wor d somewhat jokingly. Normally we don’t describe people at work as our en emies, but that’s how Kazuya is describing Monica.

He says, “She criticizes all of my ideas, but I’ve learned that the best defense is not to get defensive.” “To criticize” someone is to  say that his idea has problems, or the things that he is doing are wrong or perhaps  simply not good enough, not of a high enough quality. Kazuya says that Monica a lways criticizes his ideas. She says his ideas aren’t good enough.

Kazuya says that he’s learned that “the best defens e is not to get defensive.” “Defense” (defense) are things you do to protect yo urself or to stop someone who is competing against you from winning. If you t hink of, say, a football game – an American football game – one side has the ball. They’re the offense. The other side is trying to stop them from moving down the field. They’re the defense.

Most sports that have teams have offense and defens e, or at least the teams are playing offense or defense during different parts of the game.

Kazuya says, “The best defense is not to get defens ive.” “To get defensive” (defensive) is to be worried about someone else cri ticizing you and to try to explain why something isn’t your fault. Someone who  is defensive often thinks that other people are criticizing him, and so he sa ys things to make sure that people don’t think something is his fault.

Kazuya says to Monica, “I appreciate your feedback. ” “Feedback” (feedback) is information that someone or something gives you to tell you how well you are doing something or whether other people like it. If  you write an essay at school, or a long paper, and you give it to the professor, the professor may give you feedback on your paper. Notice we use the prepositi on “on” – you get feedback “on” something. The professor may say, “Oh, that wa s a great paper,” or he might say, “That was a terrible paper.” That’s usua lly what happened to me.

Kazuya continues, “I understand your reservations, but let me show you these figures I’ve worked up, which I believe will addres s your concerns.” The word “reservation” is used when you have an appointment at a certain restaurant or when you are going to stay in a certain hotel, but we also use the word “reservation” to mean “hesitation” – reasons for no t wanting to do something. If someone says, “I have reservations about going on t his trip,” she means, “I have doubts about it” – there are reasons why I don’t th ink it’s a good idea.

Kazuya says he understands Monica’s reservations. “ But,” he says, “let me show you these figures I’ve worked up.” The word “figure s” (figures) here means numbers, calculations. You added or subtracted or m ultiplied something and it gives you some information that’s important. “To wo rk up” something or “to work something up” is a phrasal verb meaning to create o r develop something. It could also mean to calculate some figures, as is the case  in our story here. “To work something up” usually means to present what we call  a “first draft” (draft) of something.

If you are working on the design of a website, you may work up some examples to show your client, your customer, so that that pe rson can look at it and give you feedback on it. You see? It all works together. Kaz uya says that the figures that he’s worked up will address Monica’s concerns. “To address (address) someone’s concerns” means to discuss or handle some thing, to take care of the particular problem. So, in this case, Kazuya will s how Monica something that Monica can look at and see that Kazuya’s idea is a good one.

Kazuya then says to us, not to Monica, “I knew Moni ca would attack my ideas, so I had come prepared.” Monica says, “That’s all very  impressive, but I still think we need to consider other options.” Monica is saying that what Kazuya did is very interesting, even something that is very good, but she still thinks that the company or the group needs to think about other pos sibilities other than what Kazuya said. That’s why Kazuya says to us, “Unfortu nately, when Monica digs in her heels, I know the only thing to do is to placat e her.”

The expression “to dig in your heels” (heels) means  to become very stubborn, to refuse to change your opinion or decision even thou gh other people want you to. The “heel” is the bottom back part of a shoe, and “ to dig” means to create a little hole in the ground. You can imagine someone who dig s in his heels outside – say, in the ground. He would be trying to prevent s omeone from moving him from his position. That’s where we get this expression “ to dig in your heels.” Once again, it means to become very stubborn and refuse to change your opinion or decision. That’s how Kazuya describes Monica.

He says when this happens, when she digs in her hee ls, “the only thing to do is to placate her.” “To placate” (placate) means to ma ke another person feel less angry or less mad by addressing his needs or addres sing his concerns even though you think it really shouldn’t be necessary. If you come home late from work and you didn’t call your wife, you may need to  placate her because she will be very angry at you. You need to say things that w ill make her less angry at you, and if you don’t know what to say, well, you probab ly won’t be married for very long.

Kazuya says that placating Monica is a good idea. “ Plus,” he says, “a delaying tactic usually works.” “To delay” (delay) something  is to not do it when you planned on doing it – to do it at a later time, to postpone it. We might also say a “tactic” (tactic) is a strategy, an approach, the w ay you do something. So, a “delaying tactic” is something you do to make somet hing happen later than when you had planned on doing it or than when it should have been done. Kazuya is going to use a delaying tactic which we learn about  in the next sentence.

He says to Monica, “Your comments have given me a l ot to think about. We’re running short on time.” “To run short on time” mean s that you don’t have very much time left in a meeting, for example. He says, “We want to get to the other topics for discussion, so let’s come back to it nex t week.” Kazuya is suggesting that they stop talking about this topic right now –  Kazuya’s ideas – and go on to something else so they can talk about it again the following week. That’s a delaying tactic. He’s making things last longer tha n they would have otherwise because he thinks that will help in getting his ide as approved by Monica.

 Then Kazuya says at the end, “Luckily,” fortunately , “I know something about Monica. She has a short attention span.” Your “atte ntion span” (span) is how long you can concentrate on one topic, how long you can focus on something without thinking about anything else. If you have a short a ttention span, you can’t focus on something for very long. We could say you have a  long attention span, though usually the phrase you will hear most often is “sho rt attention span.”

Kazuya concludes, “By next week, she’ll be on to he r next victim.” A “victim” (victim) is a person who suffers from some problem or action. It’s a person who’s been hurt by something or someone. We can talk abou t “victims of crime” – people who have been hurt or injured in some way by  another person. Someone may have stolen something from him or even killed h im. We would call someone who has been killed a “murder victim.”

Well, we’re not talking about murder here – what Ka zuya is saying is that by waiting till next week to talk about his ideas with  Monica, Monica will have forgotten about this idea and will have gone “on to ,” or put her focus or attention on, someone else in the office she doesn’t like or doesn’t agree with. That’s what Kazuya means by “her next victim” – someone else in  the office that she can attack or criticize.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue (or the story) at a native rate of speech.
