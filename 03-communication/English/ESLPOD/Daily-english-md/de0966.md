I’ll be back around eight o’clock.  Marcelo: Hey, where are you going in such a hurry?  Debbie: I’m going to my religious education class.   Marcelo: Religious education class? What’s that about?  Debbie: Well, I’ve decided to convert to McQuillanism.   Marcelo: I’m not familiar with that denomination. It is Christian, isn’t it?  Debbie: No, it isn’t, but there are some similarities in the spiritual teachings between McQuillanism and Christianity, but we have different ways of worshiping – different prayers, hymns, and rituals.  Marcelo: It doesn’t sound legit. Are you sure McQuillanism isn’t really a cult?  Debbie: Of course not. My spiritual leader has been tutoring me on the tenets of the faith so I understand it, but I can see why you’d question it, since you don’t know anything about it.   Marcelo: Well, as long as you’re satisfied.
