This episode is a dialogue between Donny and Helene  about planning what you’re going to eat this week. I’m hungry already. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Donny: Have you ever heard of something called a “m eal plan”?

Helene: Sure, I make one each week before I go groc ery shopping. It saves time and money.

Donny: My mother suggested I make one now that I’m staying home with the kids and Sydney is going back to work.

Helene: See this? This is my meal plan. I map out t he dinners I’ll be making each day. It helps me a lot.

Donny: How? It seems like a lot of work.

Helene: Well, for one thing, I only have to go groc ery shopping once a week. I buy a week’s worth of groceries in one fell swoop.

Donny: I guess that’s helpful, but it still seems l ike too much work.

Helene: Here’s what I do. I look at each week’s sto re circular to see what’s seasonal and on sale. I pull out my recipes that in clude those items and I see if I have any coupons I can use.

Donny: I still don’t see how I can save much money.

Helene: I also use the sale items for more than one  meal and make enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day. It works lik e a charm.

Donny: I think I’ll stick to my original plan.

Helene: Which is?

Donny: To plead ignorance and ask my mother over to  our house to give me cooking lessons. By the time I cook well enough on my own, the children will be nearly full-grown!

Our dialogue begins with Donny asking Helene, “Have  you ever heard of something called a ‘meal plan’?” A “meal” (meal) is  what you eat at a certain time during the day. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are th ree meals that most people eat each day. A “meal plan” is something you write down  describing what you’re going to eat in the next, say, week or even month. Helene says, “Sure, I make one,” meaning I write a meal plan, “each week befor e I go grocery shopping.”

“Grocery (grocery) shopping” refers going to a stor e to buy food. “Groceries” is another word for food that you buy in a store to ea t and or prepare at home. Helene says, “It’s saves time and money” – that is,  having a meal plan saves time and money. Donny says that his mother suggeste d that he make a meal plan since he is now staying home with his kids, hi s children, and Sidney, his wife, is going back to work. Helene says, “See this ?” She’s obviously showing something to Donny we can’t see. Well, you can’t se e it. I can see it because I’m right here.

Helene says, “See this? This is my meal plan. I map  out the dinners I’ll be making each day.” “To map (map) out” is a two-word phrasal verb that can mean simply to plan and describe something in detail by writing it down. People will sometimes use this expression in business. “Let’s m ap out our future.” Let’s plan what we’re going to do in the next month or two mon ths or year. Literally, “to map out” would be to draw on a piece of paper or to tak e a map and indicate where you are going to travel. Donny says, “How?” How doe s this help you? “It seems like a lot of work.”

Helene says, “Well, for one thing, I only have to g o grocery shopping once a week. I buy a week’s worth of groceries in one fell  swoop.” Helene says she only goes to the grocery store once of week. She buys “a  week’s worth” (worth). A “week’s worth” of something would be enough of some thing that would last you,

that would be enough for you to use, for an entire seven days. “A month’s worth” would be enough for a month, and so forth. She buys  “a week’s worth of groceries in one fell (fell) swoop (swoop).” The ex pression “in one fell swoop” means all at once, at a single time.

Donny says, “I guess that’s helpful, but it still s eems like too much work.” Helene then explains what she does. She says, “I look at e ach week’s store circular to see what’s seasonal and on sale.” Here in the Unite d States, grocery stores will often include in a local newspaper or mail to you s omething called a “circular” (circular). The word “circular” is just a special t erm for an advertisement that shows all of the discounts, all of the sales, at a particular store. Helene looks for “seasonal food.” Food that is “seasonal” (seasonal)  is food that is fresh. We’re talking here about fruits and vegetables.

Helene says she also looks for anything else that’s  “on sale.” “To be on sale” (sale) means it is being sold at a lower price than  usual, than normal. She says, “I pull out my recipes that include these items and  I see if I have any coupons I can use.” A “recipe” (recipe) is a set of written i nstructions or steps on how to prepare a certain kind of food. A “coupon” (coupon)  is usually a small piece of paper that gives you a certain discount, a lower pr ice, when you bring it to the store. Nowadays people have coupons that are electr onic that you can have on your phone or in an email.

Donny says, “I still don’t see how I can save much money,” meaning a lot of money. Helene says, “I also use the sale items for more than one meal and to make enough to have leftovers for lunch the next da y.” “Leftovers” (leftovers) refers to food that you prepared for one meal but d idn’t finish, and therefore are able to eat at a later time. So, if you make someth ing for dinner and you have some food that is “leftover,” that is extra, you ca n eat that food tomorrow for lunch.

Helene says, “It works like a charm” – that is, her  plan “works like a charm” (charm). The expression “to work like a charm” mean s it works very well. It’s an excellent solution to a problem. Donny, however, do esn’t seem convinced. He’s not persuaded. He says, “I think I’ll stick to my o riginal plan.” “To stick (stick) to” something is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to con tinue doing what you have been doing, to continue doing something without cha nging it. Donny is going to stick to his first or original plan. Helene says, “ Which is?” meaning “What is that plan?”

Donny then explains: “To plead ignorance and ask my  mother over to our house to give me cooking lessons.” “To plead (plead) igno rance (ignorance)” means to

say that you don’t know something or understand som ething, even though you may in fact know it or understand it. If someone “p leads ignorance,” they say “I didn’t know” or “I don’t know” something. Maybe tha t person is telling the truth and maybe he isn’t. Donny wants to plead ignorance about cooking and ask his mother over to his house – that is to say, “invite”  her to his house – to give him “cooking lessons,” to teach him how to cook.

He says, “By the time I cook well enough on my own, ” meaning by the time or by that point in the future when I am able to cook wit hout my mother’s help, “the children will be nearly full-grown.” “To be “full ( full) – grown (grown)” means to be an adult, to no longer be a child. If we say someon e is “full-grown,” we mean that person is now no longer a child. They’re 18 years old or 21 years old, or it could also refer to a adolescent who has stopped growing,  who will no longer get any taller, for example. “Full-grown” could also descri be a plant or a tree that will no longer grow any more or get any bigger than it is n ow.

Here it refers to Donny’s children becoming old eno ugh so that they are adults. Donny is saying that because he will learn to cook so slowly from his mother, his mother will in fact do most of the cooking for his children until they are practically adults. It sounds to me like Donny’s plan is better  than any meal plan.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
