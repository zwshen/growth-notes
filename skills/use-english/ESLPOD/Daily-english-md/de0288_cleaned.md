Our episode is called “A Business Contract.”  It's a dialogue between two people – two business people – who are coming to an agreement about something.  Let's get started.  > Violet:  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me about the new contract.  It’s important that both parties understand and agree to all of the terms before we can move ahead.  Karik:  It’s in the best interest of both of our companies for this agreement to be signed, so I’m glad to be here.  How should we proceed?  Violet:  You and I have both read the contract, but I think it’s useful to go over the main articles to make sure there aren’t any clauses that are objectionable.  If you’ll take a look at Article One...   .......  Karik:  This looks in order.  The stipulations we asked for are all there.  Now if we can move to Article Six, I have a question about the conditions for declaring the contract null and void.  Violet:  I’m glad you brought that up.  I know that this was a sticking point during the negotiations and I believe we’ve found an acceptable compromise.    Karik:  I’m sure you have.  Let’s take a look.
