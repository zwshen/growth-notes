This episode is a dialogue between Julie and Ed abo ut people who need to leave their home country and go to a different country be cause they’re not safe where they’re living now. Let’s get started.  

[start of dialogue] 

Julie: The government is out to get me. I feel like  I don’t have any real freedom and everything I do is being monitored. 

Ed: Maybe you should move to another country.  

Julie: I guess that’s one solution.  

Ed: Yes, you should seek asylum in another country.   

Julie: Become a refugee? I’m not sure I want to do that. 

Ed: Well, if you feel like you’re being persecuted,  you should look for other options.  

Julie: That seems a little extreme. 

Ed: People who are being treated unfairly because o f their political opinions or religious beliefs have the option to emigrate.  

Julie: I’m not sure I’d go that far.  

Ed: I urge you to think about it. Other countries h ave resettlement programs for refugees, and not every country will have reached t heir quota yet this year. You might still find a country that will take you. 

Julie: I didn’t say that I wanted to renounce my ci tizenship. I was just letting off steam. 

Ed: That’s the problem with you young people these days. You have no follow- through and no courage of your convictions. You all  need to man up! 

[end of dialogue] 

Julie begins our dialogue by saying to Ed, “The gov ernment is out to get me.” When you say someone or some organization is “out t o get” you, you mean that the person is trying to create problems or difficul ties for you. If someone says, “My teacher is out to get me,” he means that the te acher doesn’t like him and is trying to do something bad to him. Usually when tha t happens, it’s the student’s fault, of course. As a teacher, I have to say that.   

Julie says, “I feel like I don’t have any real free dom and everything I do is being monitored.” “Freedom” is the ability to choose what  you want to do and do it when you want to do it. We can talk about freedom a s it relates to political expression, of giving your opinion. We could talk a bout “religious freedom” – the ability to practice the religion that you want. All  of these are kinds of freedoms.  

Julie says she doesn’t feel like she has any real f reedom and that everything she does “is being monitored.” “To monitor” means to wa tch or observe something, especially if you are trying to see whether that th ing is changing. Here, we think Julie is referring to the government watching her a ctions and making sure she doesn’t do anything the government doesn’t like. Ed  says, “Maybe you should move to another country.” Julie says, “I guess that ’s one solution” – that’s one answer to this problem.  

Ed says, “Yes, you should seek asylum in another co untry.” “To seek asylum” (asylum) means to go to another country, or to the officials of another country, and ask for permission to live in that country. Usu ally people seek asylum when they don’t feel safe in the country where they are living now, perhaps because the government is persecuting them. “To persecute” (persecute) someone is to treat someone unfairly, often because of their poli tical or religious beliefs. When that happens, people sometimes seek asylum. They tr y to go to a different country.  

Julie says to Ed, “Become a refugee?” She means, “D o you mean I should become a refugee?” A “refugee” (refugee) is a perso n who has to leave his or her home country, often because there is a war or there ’s some situation making it unsafe for the person to live there. You could have  political refugees. You could have refugees for other reasons as well. Perhaps th ere was a natural disaster or something bad has happened in a country. People lea ve that country to try to go to another country. We call those people “refugees. ”  

Julie says, “I’m not sure what I want to do.” Ed sa ys, “Well, if you feel like you’re being persecuted, you should look for other options .” Julie says, “That seems a little extreme.” When we describe something as bein g “extreme” (extreme), we mean that it is too much of something, that it’s a very large amount of something. In this case, it means perhaps that the solution th at Ed is proposing is too “drastic,” we could say. It goes too far. Maybe she  can do something that doesn’t require her to actually leave the country and go to  another country.  

Ed continues, “People who are being treated unfairl y because of their political opinions or religious beliefs have the option to em igrate.” The term “religious beliefs” refers to the kind of religion that you pr actice. In some countries it can be very dangerous not to be of the religion of the maj ority, and that would be a case where you might be persecuted for your religious be liefs.  

Ed says that people who are being treated unfairly “have the option to emigrate.” “To emigrate” (emigrate) means to leave one country  to go to another country. Now, we have another word that sounds quite similar , which is “immigrate” (immigrate). Really, the two words mean the same th ing, or refer to the same action. They just emphasize a different aspect of t hat action. If you “emigrate” from one country, you “immigrate” to another countr y.  

So, someone could say, “I immigrated to the United States.” That means that person came here. However, the same person could sa y, “I emigrated from Ireland” (or from Japan, or from Columbia). “To emi grate” puts the emphasis on leaving the country where you’re living now. “To im migrate” puts the emphasis on coming to the country where you have arrived. Julie  says, “I’m not sure I’d go that far.” She’s not sure if she wants to actually leave  the country.  

Ed, however, says, “I urge you to think about it.” “To urge” (urge) someone means to encourage someone, to tell that person tha t you strongly believe that he or she should do this certain thing, this action . Ed says, “Other countries have resettlement programs for refugees.” “Resettlement”  refers to the process of helping people come to a new country and adapt to t he life there. We usually use this term when we’re talking about a large group of  people, typically political or  

religious refugees who are leaving their home count ry and coming as a group to another country.  

When I was growing up, for example, in the 1970s, t here were a lot of refugees from Vietnam. Those refugees participated in a rese ttlement program where the U.S. government helped them to come to the United S tates and find housing for them and find them jobs and so forth. “Resettlement  programs” are usually run by the government, although sometimes private organ izations participate in that as well.  

Ed says that “not every country will have reached t heir quota yet this year.” A “quota” (quota) is usually the maximum or the minim um number of people that you can have – or it could be for a certain number of anything, really, that you can have. For example, if you are a salesperson – y ou work selling things to other companies – your company may give you a quota . They may say, “You have to sell a thousand dollars every week of our p roduct or service.” That thousand dollars is your quota.  

If you sell a thousand dollars, then we would say y ou have “met” (met) your quota. The verb would be “to meet” a quota. “Quota”  here refers not to money, but to people. Many countries, including the United  States, have a limit to the number of people they will accept as immigrants eac h year. That number is the quota – in this case, the maximum number of people that they will accept. Ed is saying that some countries have not yet reached the ir quota this year – presumably, their quota for refugees. “You might st ill find a country that will take you” – that will accept you.  

Julie says, “I didn’t say I wanted to renounce my c itizenship. I was just letting off steam.” “To renounce (renounce) your citizenship” i s to say that you no longer want to be considered part of a certain country. If  you renounce your American citizenship, you’re saying, “I no longer want to be  an American. I don’t want to be legally considered an American.” Usually that means  that you no longer have an American passport. In fact, in all cases I think it  would mean that.  

Julie says, however, that she does not want to reno unce her citizenship. She was just “letting off steam” (steam). The expression “t o let off steam” means to say something or to do something that expresses your fr ustration, your anger, your irritation, but it is not meant to be taken too ser iously. Someone who is letting off steam is someone who is perhaps yelling, shouting, or saying things about another person – complaining about something as a w ay of getting those emotions out, to release those negative feelings th at they have.  

It’s a psychological thing. You don’t really want t o do some of the things perhaps even that you say when you are letting off steam. E d, however, says, “That’s the problem with you young people these days. You have no follow-through and no courage of your convictions. You all need to man up !” From the dialogue, we’re guessing that Ed is older than Julie – perhaps quit e a bit older – because she refers to her as being a member of a group that he considers “young people.”  

He says that “young people today have no follow-thr ough.” “Follow-through” refers to completing or finishing the actions that you’ve started. “Follow-through” means getting something done, completing something – not stopping halfway through, not quitting before you’ve finished. The e xpression “courage of your convictions” refers to a confidence and perhaps the  certainty that what you are doing is right. Your “convictions” are your beliefs . “To have the courage of your convictions” means to really believe what you say a nd therefore be willing to act on those beliefs, those convictions.  

That’s why Ed ends our dialogue by saying, “You all ” – meaning you young people, including Julie – “need to man up.” “To man  up” is a somewhat recent phrasal verb that has become popular. It means to b e brave, to be courageous. Usually it’s addressed to men. If you say to a man,  “You should man up,” you’re saying that the man should take responsibility, to do what a man would do – to be strong, to be courageous.  

Here, however, Ed is addressing it to a whole group  of people, which is a little unusual, but we understand what he’s saying here. H e’s saying that Julia and the other people who have similar convictions should fo llow through. They should do what they say they want to do.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
