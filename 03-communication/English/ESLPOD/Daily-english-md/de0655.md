This episode is called “Staying in a Vacation Renta l.”  This is when you go on vacation but you don’t say in a hotel, you stay in someone else’s house or apartment.  Of course, you pay them money to do tha t.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

George:  I’m kind of nervous staying in a vacation rental for the first time.

Marnie:  Don’t worry.  Before I booked this unit, I  checked it out thoroughly.  It’s pet-friendly and kid-friendly, and it sleeps six, s o it’ll be perfect for the whole family.

George:  But there won’t be the same amenities or s ervices as a hotel.

Marnie:  We won’t need any of those.  Just think, we’ll have the run of the place and there are no adjoining units.  The proximity to  town is great and I got a last- minute price that’s even lower than their low seaso n rate.

George:  Everything sounds good, but…

Marnie:  It’ll be our home away from home.  Units t his close to the beach are scarce, and this one is really affordable.

George:  A little too affordable, if you ask me.  You said that it’s just $60 a night?

Marnie:  That’s right.

George:  Are there any taxes or cleaning fees?

Marnie:  I didn’t ask about that.

George:  Do they require a refundable deposit?

Marnie:  I didn’t check that either.

George:  Then maybe it’s too good to be true.  Befo re we get too excited, let’s go read the fine print.

[end of dialogue]

George says to his wife Marnie at the beginning of the dialogue, “I’m kind of nervous,” meaning I’m a little nervous – “I’m kind of nervous,” that’s an informal way of saying a little bit.  He’s kind of nervous s taying in a vacation rental for the first time.  A “vacation rental” is a home, condomi nium, or apartment that you rent; it could also be a room in someone’s house.  You rent it for a short period of time just like a hotel room, although usually you h ave a kitchen and it’s more like a regular house.  Vacation rentals have become very  popular.  People rent out their houses or their apartments to people who are visiting that area.  I’ve stayed in vacation rentals many times, and really find it much better than staying in a hotel, and often even a little cheaper.

Marnie says to George, “Don’t worry.  Before I book ed this unit, I checked it out thoroughly.”  “To book” (book) as a verb means to make a reservation, to call or email or write someone and say I want to stay in yo ur hotel or your vacation rental for this day through this day.  “To book” me ans to reserve.  Marnie says, “Before I booked this unit,” meaning this vacation rental – sometimes a unit refers to an apartment or a condominium that is also a vac ation rental, or just a regular rental.  Marnie says she “checked it out,” meaning she investigated it, she checked it out thoroughly.  “It’s pet-friendly and kid-friendly.”  “Pet-friendly” is a place where you can take your dog or your cat, or p erhaps your pig or goat if you have those as pets, and you can bring them with you  on vacation.  If you bring a cow with you, for example, you don’t have to pay for milk, so that’s something to think about!  Pet-friendly, then, is a hotel or a v acation rental where you can bring your favorite pet, like a snake.  “Kid-friendly” is  a place where you can bring another kind of animal, small children, so that is also an advantage if you have small children.  If you don’t, then, it might be a disadvantage if you are staying next door to the place with the small children, but  let’s get back to the dialogue. This place that Marnie found is pet-friendly and ki d-friendly and it “sleeps six,” meaning six people can sleep in this unit; there are six beds or beds big enough to fit six people.  She says it’s perfect for the w hole family – for our entire family, for everyone

 George says, “But there won’t be the same amenities  or services as a hotel.”  An “amenity” (amenity) is some characteristic that mak es something more comfortable or more enjoyable.  You may go to a hot el that also has a pool and a spa, that would be a hotel with extra amenities, ni ce things that will make your stay more comfortable.

Marnie says, “We won’t need any of those (any of th ose amenities).  Just think, we’ll have the run of the place and there are no ad joining units.”  “To have the run of the place” is a phrase meaning to be able to  do whatever you want because no one is watching you – no one is observin g you.  In this case, Marnie says they’ll have the vacation rental; they’ll be t he only people there so they’ll have the run of the place and there are no adjoinin g units.  “Adjoining” (adjoining) means next to something; we might also say “adjacen t.”  It usually means, when we’re talking about a condominium or an apartment, that you don’t have anyone who shares a wall; that is, that your wall is the s ame as the wall for the unit next to you.  Marnie says, “The proximity to town is gre at.”  “Proximity” means closeness, nearness.  It’s a short distance from to wn, meaning the main town wherever they’re staying.  She says and she got a l ast-minute price that’s even lower than their low season rate.  The phrase “last -minute” means without any advance notice.  In this case, it means something y ou do right at the very last moment, right before you’re about to do something e lse or right before something else happens.  So, you may call two days before you  are going to leave and ask if you can book the vacation rental; that would be doing things at the last minute. Buying your girlfriend a present for Valentine’s Da y on February 13 th  is also doing things at the last minute so don’t wait gentlemen!

Marnie says they got a rate – a price, even lower t han their low season rate. “Low season” is the time of year when there are few  customers, there aren’t very many people traveling to that area.  Minnesota’s lo w season would be in the wintertime; because it’s so cold no one would want to go there.  The low season for other places will depend upon the weather and o ther things.

George says, “Everything sounds good, but…”  Marnie  interrupts him and says, “It’ll be our home away from home.”  This vacation rental will be our home away from home, meaning it will feel just like home; you  will feel very comfortable there.  She says, “Units this close to the beach are scarce, and this one is really affordable.”  Something that is “scarce” (scarce) i s something that is rare, not common, difficult to find.  There are other meaning s of “scarce,” take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations .  We also have some additional explanations of the word “sleep,” which you will find in the guide as well.

 Marnie says this vacation unit – this vacation rent al is very affordable. Something that is “affordable” has a low price; it’ s inexpensive, it doesn’t cost a lot of money.  George says, “A little too affordabl e, if you ask me,” meaning maybe the price is so low because it isn’t very goo d quality.  He’s worried about how good the unit is, and he is, we might say, susp icious; he has doubts about why the price is so low.  He says, “You said that i t’s just $60 a night?”  Marnie says, “That’s right (that’s correct).”  George says , “Are there any taxes or cleaning fees?”  A “cleaning fee” (fee) is money th at you pay in addition to your rent, meaning extra, to have the rental unit cleane d when you are done.  Many people who have vacation rentals will charge you a fee to stay there each night plus a cleaning fee, which might be $25, it might b e $100; you have to ask.

Marnie says she didn’t ask about cleaning fees or t axes.  George then asks, “Do they require a refundable deposit?”  A “deposit,” i n this case, is money that you give to someone in case something goes wrong, in ca se you break something. That way they have some money from you in case you pay for it at least they have your deposit.  If you don’t break anything, th en you get your deposit back when you leave.  A “refundable deposit” means that let’s say I decide to book a unit for June and it is currently February.  Well, I decide that in March I don’t want to go but I have already given them a $500 deposit.   A refundable deposit is one which they say, “Okay, no problem.  You cancelled, we’ll give you your money back.”  Some places may have a nonrefundable deposi t, meaning if you cancel, especially if you cancel, say, a month or two weeks  before the date that you are supposed to arrive you do not get your deposit back .

Marnie didn’t check about a refundable deposit.  Ge orge then says, “Then maybe it’s too good to be true.”  “To be too good to be t rue” means it appears to be very good, but there are some problems with it that are not immediately obvious; there are some disadvantages.  If someone says they will sell you their car for $100 and the car is new, that’s too good to be true; the re’s probably something else wrong here that should make you be a little suspici ous.  George says, “Before we get too excited, let’s go read the fine print.”  “F ine (fine) print” refers to typically the legal language in a contract or agreement; some times it is printed in a very small size – a very small font size.  We call that fine print when it’s printed very small so you can almost not read it – you can barel y read it.  You may see an advertisement in the newspaper that says that you can buy a new television for $50, but then if you look at the bottom of the adve rtisement in very small print – in very small size lettering – it will say, well, o nly if you also buy a $25,000 car. That would be an example of reading the fine print to get all of the details of this offer or this sale.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
