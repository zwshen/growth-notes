Problem B: Inviting Politicians</A>&nbsp;</FONT></B></TABLE></CENTER>
</H1>
 
Before the next parliamentary election the president is going to have a
meeting with the top politicians of the country. But, as you know, our
politicians are usually arrogant in nature and can't tolerate opposition. So,
if all of them are invited to the same meeting, they will ruin it (the same
way they are ruining the country). However, from his past experience the
president knows that he can always divide the politicians into four disjoint
groups such that no two fighting politicians are placed in the same group.
Then each of the four groups will be invited on a different day and thus
avoiding any unpleasant situation. 

<P>
The president requests you to help him in solving the problem.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The first line of the input contains an integer 
<!-- MATH: $T (\le 15)$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="10052img1.gif"
 ALT="$T (\le 15)$">
indicating the
number of test cases to follow.

<P>
The first line of each test case contains two
integers 
<!-- MATH: $N (\le 300)$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="79" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="10052img2.gif"
 ALT="$N (\le 300)$">
and 
<!-- MATH: $M (\le 5000)$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="10052img3.gif"
 ALT="$M (\le 5000)$">.
Each of the next <I>N</I> lines contains
the name of a politician. No name will be more than 10 characters long and
will not contain any white­space character. Each of the next <I>M</I> lines contains
the name of two politicians (both of which are valid names occurring in the
names­list given at the beginning of the test case) who are not in good terms
with each other and hence can not be placed in the same group.   

<P>

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each test case in the input first output the test case number (starting
from 1) as shown in the sample output. Then for each <I>i</I>(= 1, 2, 3, 4) print
an integer <I>P</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> on line 2<I>i</I> indicating the number of politicians to be
invited on day <I>i</I>, and on line 2<I>i</I> + 1 print the names of those politicians
with every two consecutive names separated by a single white­space character.
Assume that the politicians can always be invited in 4 days and can never be
invited in less than 4 days. Note that the solution is not unique and hence
any valid solution is acceptable. 

<P>
Print a blank line between two consecutive test cases.
