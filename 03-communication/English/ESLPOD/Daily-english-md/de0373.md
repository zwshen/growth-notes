This episode is about ordering food from a restaurant to be delivered to your house.  It’s a conversation between a woman who’s calling and ordering the food and the restaurant employee.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Order clerk:  Hello, Torino’s Restaurant.  Nancy:  Hello, I’d like to place a delivery order.    Order clerk:  Can I have your address and the major cross streets, please?  Nancy:  It’s 1212 Main Street, and the nearest cross streets are Speedway and Highland.  Order clerk:  Okay, it looks like you’re in our delivery area.  What would you like to order?  Nancy:  I’d like an order of spaghetti.  Does that come with any sides?  Order clerk:  You have a choice of soup or salad.    Nancy:  I’ll have the salad.    Order clerk:  Is that all?  We have a $15 minimum for delivery orders.  Nancy:  In that case, I’ll also take an appetizer sampler plate.
