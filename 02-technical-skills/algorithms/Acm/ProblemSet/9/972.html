<h1 align="center"><font color=blue>Problem A - Horizon Line</font></h1>

<p>Let  <b><i>f(x)</i></b> and <b><i>g(x)</i></b> be two functions
defined in the same domain <b>[a,b]</b>. The horizon line corresponds
to the function that presents, in each point <b><i>x</i></b>,
the maximum value from both original functions: <b><i>h(x)=Max(f, g)</i></b>.


<p class=center><img src="p972.gif" width="408" height="418" alt="" border="0"><br><b>Figure 1 - </b> Construction of a horizon function

<p>The maximum value of <b><i>h(x)</i></b> can be directly obtained
from the both functions maxima, so it wouldn't make it necessary to
determine the horizon line. Nevertheless, the same is not true for the
minimum value of
<b><i>h(x)</i></b> that has to be evaluated through a more complex method.
 
<h2><font color=blue>The Problem</font></h2>

<p>Your task for this problem is to evaluate the minimum value of a
horizon line <b><i>h(x)</i></b>, given two functions <b><i>f(x)</i></b>
and <b><i>g(x)</i></b>. To make it easier, both initial functions are
composed by different steps like the dotted lines represented in
figure 1, but <b><i>x</i></b> and <b><i>y</i></b> values are not
necessarily integer values. Each function is composed by a sequence of
<b><i>N</i></b> steps, with each step being defined by a length and a
value.
It is ensured that the last step ends at the domain upper limit and
the domain is always <b>[0,10]</b>.

<h2><font color=blue>Input</font></h2>

<b>
The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.
Consecutive test cases are separated by a single blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>
<p>The input is made of two sequences of text lines, representing the functions <b><i>f</i></b> and <b><i>g</i></b>.

<p>In each sequence, the first line contains the number of the
function
steps <b>N</b> (integer format); it is followed by <b><i>N</i></b>
lines containing, each one, the step value and the step length
(by this order, in decimal format) separated by one or more spaces.
It is ensured that a sequence has no more than 100 steps.

<h2><font color=blue>Output</font></h2>

<p>For each test case, the output is made of one text line containing the minimum value of the horizon line <b><i>h(x)</i></b>. It must be rounded to
three decimal digits.
