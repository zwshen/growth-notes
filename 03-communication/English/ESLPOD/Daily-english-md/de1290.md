This episode is a dialogue between Martin and his f riend Asta about the speed and power of a car. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Martin: Did you see that? It’s the new McQ. It does  0 to 60 in four seconds. It has amazing performance.

Asta: That car? I guess it’s nice. I like the color .

Martin: Color?! Who cares about the color? The McQ is supposed to top out at 155, but it’s been clocked at 160. Can you imagine?

Asta: No, I can’t.

Martin: It has more horsepower than any car on the market and amazing torque. You wouldn’t believe the RPMs.

Asta: So it can go fast?

Martin: Yeah, it can go fast. It’s supposed to be r eally responsive, too, and the reviews say that the acceleration is really smooth.  I bet that’s because of the tuning.

Asta: I like cars with more trunk space.

Martin: You don’t drive a car like the McQ for its storage capacity. You drive it for speed.

Asta: My cousin doesn’t like it that much. He says it doesn’t have enough legroom.

 Martin: What?! Your cousin owns a McQ?

Asta: Yes, but he only drives it when his Ediger is  in the shop.

Martin: How is it possible that I’ve known you for years and this is the first time you’ve mentioned this cousin to me? You know that I ’m the biggest car enthusiast in the world, don’t you?

Asta: My cousin isn’t in town very often. He’s usua lly traveling to races.

Martin: Your cousin is a race car driver?

Asta: Yes, didn’t I mention that either?

[end of dialogue]

Martin begins our dialogue by asking Asta, “Did you  see that? It’s the McQ. It does 0 to 60 in four seconds.” “0” and “60” here re fer to miles per hour – as in the speed, in this case, of a car. So, if a car “does,”  or goes, “0 to 60 in four seconds,” it can go from 0 – that is, from not movi ng at all – to 60 miles per hour as a speed in four seconds.

In American television ads, or advertisements, for cars, you often hear the term “0 to 60” to describe how fast a car can accelerate , how fast it can speed up. The shorter the time it takes to go from 0 to 60, suppo sedly the better the car engine or motor – the part of the car that makes it move.

Martin says this car, which is called the McQ – no relation to me – has “amazing performance.” “Performance” (performance) refers to  how well something works. You could talk about a person’s “performance” on the job. Their “job performance” would be how well they work at this pa rticular job or in this position. The performance of a car refers to how well it driv es, how fast it goes, how reliable it is, and so forth.

Asta says, “That car? I guess it’s nice. I like the  color.” Martin is talking about the performance of the car, but Asta refers to its colo r. She’s not interested in how well the car runs. She’s interested in how the car looks. Martin is surprised, because of course he doesn’t care about the color o f the car.

In fact, he says, “Who cares about the color? The M cQ,” meaning this car named McQ, “is supposed to top out at 155.” “To top (top)  out” means to reach the

highest value of something, or to reach what we mig ht call the “upper (upper) limit” of something. “To top out” in the case of a car would mean the fastest it can go, the highest speed it can go. In this case, it’s  155 miles per hour, which is pretty fast. That would be about 250 kilometers per  hour for those of you who use kilometers, which is most of you.

Martin says that the car is “supposed to top out at  155,” meaning perhaps that’s what the car company says. “But,” he adds, “it’s be en clocked at 160.” “To be clocked (clocked) at” means to be recorded at a par ticular speed or to be proven by someone else measuring the speed to be actually faster. So, if the car has been “clocked at 160,” someone has actually driven the car and measured its speed and found out that it can actually go faster than 155 miles per hour; it can go 160.

Martin then asks Asta, “Can you imagine?” That ques tion, “Can you imagine?” is used when we are surprised by something, and we are  indicating to someone else how surprising that is. For example, let’s say  you go to work and your boss comes in drunk, having drunk too much alcohol that morning – because you know, you can’t drink too much alcohol before you g o to work, just a little bit. Well, you may say to your friend, “My boss came in drunk today. Can you imagine?” You are indicating how surprised you are that your boss came in drunk today.

Asta responds to Martin’s statement “Can you imagin e?” – his question – by saying, “No, I can’t,” meaning “I can’t imagine.” S he’s also indicating by her response that perhaps she isn’t very interested in the same thing Martin is. Martin continues, however, “It” – meaning the McQ, the car – “has more horsepower then any car on the market and amazing t orque.”

“Horsepower” (horsepower) is how we measure the pow er of a motor or an engine, in part because when cars were first introd uced, people compared them to the most common form of transportation before the automobile, which was a horse, of course. So, “horsepower” would refer to h ow many horses you would need to travel as fast or to have the same power as  the car. It’s equal to 550 foot pounds per second, which is the equivalent of 745.7  watts. I know, that isn’t a very helpful definition.

Martin says this car “has more horsepower than any car on the market,” meaning basically it’s more powerful than any car that is b eing sold right now. That’s what he means by the expression “on the market” (market) . He says the car also has “amazing,” meaning very good, “torque” (torque). “T orque” refers to the power of

turning or rotating something. In this case, howeve r, it is a measure of how quickly the car can go faster, can “accelerate” (ac celerate).

“To accelerate” means to increase in speed. That’s why in a car you have a, what we call a “pedal” (pedal), which is a long piece of  plastic or metal that you press on with your foot to make the car go faster. We cal l that pedal the “accelerator.” That makes the car go faster. The other pedal is ca lled the “brake” (brake) that slows down or stops a car. The opposite, however, o f “acceleration” is “deceleration,” but we don’t call a brake a “decele rator.” We call it a “brake.”

Anyway, back to our dialogue. Martin also says to A sta, “You wouldn’t believe the RPMs.” “You wouldn’t believe” means I’m going to te ll you something that is very difficult for you to believe because it’s so amazin g. “You wouldn’t believe the RPMs” – the revolutions per minute. RPMs is a measu re of how fast something moves around what we call an “axis” (axis). Basical ly it’s a measure of how hard the engine is working in a car.

Asta then says, “So it can go fast?” Martin says, “ Yeah. It can go fast. It’s supposed to be really responsive, too, and the revi ews say that the acceleration is really smooth.” When we say a car is “responsive ” (responsive), we mean that when you, for example, try to turn the car to go le ft or right, it responds very quickly; more generally, the car seems to do what y ou want it to do very easily.

Martin also says that the “reviews,” meaning articl es about the car in the newspaper or in a magazine, “say that the accelerat ion is really smooth.” We’ve already defined “acceleration” as how fast the car goes from one speed to another, how quickly it can accelerate. If the acce leration is “smooth” (smooth), it feels as though there are no bumps, or that you don ’t have any difficulty going from one speed to another. Martin adds, “I bet that ’s because of the tuning” (tuning). “Tuning” refers to how the car’s motor or  engine is adjusted so that it runs smoothly. It runs without any problems.

Asta is not interested in all of these issues that Martin is. She says instead, “I like cars with more trunk space.” The “trunk” (trunk) of  a car, in American cars, is in the back of the car. It’s where you can put things such as luggage or big boxes and bags. “Trunk space” refers to how much room you  have in your trunk. In British English, the trunk is called the “boot” (bo ot).

Martin says, “You don’t drive a car like the McQ for its storage capacity.” “Storage (storage) capacity (capacity)” is the amou nt of room in something, the amount of space you have to store or put something in. Martin is saying that a

car like the McQ is not one you would buy because i t’s a car you can put a lot of things in. He says, “You drive it for speed.”

Asta then says, “My cousin” – that is, the son or d aughter of my aunt or uncle – “doesn’t like it that much. He says it doesn’t have  enough legroom” (legroom). “Legroom” refers to the amount of space in front of  you for your legs. If you travel on an airplane, you know that many airplanes don’t have very much legroom, especially in the cheaper seats, the less expensive  seats, where I go on an airplane. There isn’t a lot of legroom. There isn’t  a lot of space for your legs, especially if you’re a tall person.

Martin is surprised by what Asta is saying. He says , “What?! Your cousin owns a McQ?” Asta says, “Yes, but he only drives it when h is Ediger is in the shop.” “Ediger” here is another kind of car. I don’t think  it’s a real car, but I’ll have to ask my friend Warren. In any case, Asta says that her c ousin only drives his McQ when his other car, his Ediger, “is in the shop” (s hop). If your car is “in the shop,” it is being fixed. It is being repaired by someone who fixes cars. We call that person, by the way, a “mechanic.” “Shop” here refer s to a place where something is fixed or repaired.

Martin says, “How is it possible that I’ve known yo u for years and this is the first time you’ve mentioned this cousin to me? You know t hat I’m the biggest car enthusiast in the world, don’t you?” A “car enthusi ast” (enthusiast) is a person who loves cars. You could be a “stamp enthusiast.” You could be a “coffee enthusiast.” An “enthusiast” is someone who loves s omething, who’s very interested in something.

Asta says, “My cousin isn’t in town very often.” “I n town” here means he isn’t in the city or the town where he normally lives. “He’s  usually traveling to races,” she says. Martin says, “Your cousin is a race car drive r?” A “race” (race) “car” (car) is a car that goes very fast that competes in a race o r a competition to see who can drive the fastest. A “race car driver” then, of cou rse, would be someone who drives a fast car in a contest or competition.

Asta says, “Yes, didn’t I mention that either?” Ast a hasn’t been telling Martin that her cousin owns these fast cars and is, in fact, a race car driver.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
