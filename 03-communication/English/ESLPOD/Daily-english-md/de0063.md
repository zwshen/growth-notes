# Missing Person, Part 3: ¡§A Woman in Pain.¡¨

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 63 – Missing Person , Part 3: “A Woman in Pain.” 

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 63. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for E ducational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  

This episode is the third of our 12-part special se ries: Missing Person , a murder mystery. In the previous episodes of Missing Person , we learned that our narrator – the person telling the story, Dr. Reeves  – is a university professor and an amateur detective. One of his students asked him  for his help to find her missing sister, Sarah.  

Dr. Reeves and the woman go over to the sister’s ap artment, and they find that there is nothing there – no evidence to tell them w hat happened. They then hear, at the very end of the episode, a noise coming from  the other side of the apartment: someone is in the bathroom. That’s where  we stopped our story in the second episode.  

Now, we continue with episode 3 of Missing Person : “A Woman in Pain.” > I put my hand on my gun and slowly opened the door wider. I saw nothing. I carefully picked up a towel from the floor. Nothing . There must be someone in the bathroom, I thought.  
> In one fell swoop, I kicked the shower curtain back . “Don’t move!” I shouted. 
> Suddenly, a little white cat jumped out of the bath tub and scurried between my legs. A cat. I should have known. 
> “Oh, Jasmine! I forgot about you!” Anne said. The c at looked happy to see her. She took her into the kitchen. I poked around the r est of the bedroom and then followed Anne into the kitchen. 
> “Does the cat have any food left in her dish?” I as ked. 
> “It’s almost gone. Poor Jasmine! You must be hungry .”  
> Our episode begins with Dr. Reeves slowly opening t he door to the bathroom with his gun in his hand. He says that “in one fell  swoop, I kicked the shower curtain back.” The expression “in one fell (fell) s woop (swoop)” means all in one action – when you do something quickly, all at the same time. We often use this expression when more than one thing happens because  of a single action. In this case, Dr. Reeves kicks the shower curtain back. You  have a shower curtain in a shower – the place where you bathe or clean yoursel f standing up – to prevent the water from going out onto the floor.  

Dr. Reeves shouted into the bathroom, “Don’t move!”  Suddenly, “a little white cat jumped out of the bathtub.” The “bathtub” – all one  word – is a place where you can sit and take a bath. Sometimes we just call it “the tub” (tub). The cat “scurried” between Dr. Reeves’s legs. “To scurry” ( scurry) means to run quickly. Usually we describe an animal with short legs that runs quickly, like a cat, as an animal that scurries. If they move suddenly, we may  say they scurried. Often, “scurried” means that they’re trying to get away fr om you or get away from something. 

Dr. Reeves says, “I should have known.” This is a v ery common expression in English, “I should have known,” which means “I shou ld have known better.” For example, I can say, “I should have known what was g oing to happen,” which means I had the knowledge or intelligence to know w hat was going to happen, but I didn’t use my brain enough to figure it out, to understand it. The cat’s name is Jasmine. Anne recognizes her, and the cat goes t o Anne. Anne, remember, is the student of Dr. Reeves whose sister has gone mis sing.  

Dr. Reeves says that he “poked around the rest of t he bedroom” and then went into the kitchen. “To poke around” (poke) – in this  case the past tense, “I poked around” – means to look around. Usually when you ar e looking for something specific, or you are just trying to see what is the re, we use this expression. You could say, for example, “I poked around in my desk drawer, trying to find the scissors,” meaning I looked around, not necessarily  in an organized way. 

Dr. Reeves asked Anne if the cat had any food left in her dish. Notice the expression, “Is there any food left (left)?” That m eans “Is there any food remaining?” When you say, “Is there any left?” you are asking or implying that there was some before and that it ran out, meaning there is no longer any left. The cat dish is, in fact, empty, so “Jasmine must b e hungry,” Anne says. Dr. Reeves concludes that Bill and Sarah haven’t been g one long since, of course, the cat is still alive, even though there is no foo d left in her dish.  

Dr. Reeves walks over to the “answering machine” or  the “telephone answering machine.” That is, of course, a little machine you have connected to your phone to take messages; when people call you, they leave a message. But no one had called. He looked around more in “the three-bedroom  apartment.” We often use the number of bedrooms to describe an apartment, no t the square footage. In some countries they say, “Well, it’s 500 square met ers,” but in the United States, we usually talk about the number of bedrooms and ba throoms. “It’s a two- bedroom apartment,” or we might say, “It’s a two-be droom, two-bath apartment.” This is a three-bedroom apartment.  

Dr. Reeves says that there was “no burglary, no bre ak-in.” A “burglary” (burglary) is when someone steals something from you. The pers on who steals something from you is sometimes called a “burglar” (burglar) – that’s the person who commits or does a burglary. A “break-in” is when so meone enters your house without you knowing it and without you obviously wa nting it. So, a burglar will often break in to a house. A break-in is just for a  house or an apartment – when a robber or someone trying to steal things goes into your apartment or house. 

Dr. Reeves checks the master bedroom. “The master b edroom” is the name we give the main bedroom, the largest bedroom. If you’ re in a house with, say, two parents and three children, the parents would sleep  in the master bedroom – it’s the biggest bedroom. Next to the master bathroom is  often a master bath. That’s the bathroom that is usually inside or near a maste r bedroom. The things that Dr. Reeves saw – “a beer bottle,” “some dirty clothes” – didn’t seem unusual. He mentions “an old Time  magazine.” “Time ” is the name of a famous magazine in English that has been around – I don’t know how lon g – for several decades (a decade being, of course, ten years).  

Dr. Reeves says that there are some pills on the ta ble, and he asks Anne, “What are these pills for?” When you ask someone, “What i s this for (for)?” you mean “What is its purpose? Why is it here?” She says to Dr. Reeves that they were for Bill’s leg, because “he messed up his leg playing f ootball.” “To mess (mess) something up” means here that he hurt it. But you c an also use the term “to mess up” when you make a mistake. You can say, “I messed  up. I made a mistake. I  

did something wrong.” So, it can have both of those  meanings. The college where Bill played football was USC, which in this s tory means the University of Southwestern California.  

Dr. Reeves can’t figure out what happened to Anne’s  sister and Anne’s brother- in-law. “A brother-in-law” is the person who is mar ried to your sister, and your “sister-in-law” is someone who is married to your b rother. The two missing people “seem to have just disappeared into thin air .” The expression “to disappear into thin (thin) air” means that there’s no clue as to what happened. You disappear so completely that no one knows what happened. Sometimes we use this expression when something disappears quick ly.  

Dr. Reeves suggests to Anne that they go to the pol ice and talk to them. But Anne doesn’t want to. She says that she had gone to  the police already. They told her “to fill out some forms and wait.” “To fil l out a form” means to put some information on a piece of paper. Dr. Reeves then st ops and looks at Anne and says to himself, “This poor kid.” He doesn’t mean h ere that she doesn’t have any money. When we say “this poor person,” we mean “thi s unfortunate person,” when something bad has happened to them. 

He describes her as “twenty-two” – meaning 22 years  old – “and in such pain.” “In such pain” here means “in a lot of pain.” Then a telephone rings. It is Anne’s cell phone, or mobile phone. She answers it, and he r face suddenly becomes very sad. She hangs up and says to Dr. Reeves, “Tha t was Bill. Something terrible has happened!” 

On the next episode of Missing Person , we’ll find out what terrible thing happened. 

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a norma l speed. 

[start of story] 

I put my hand on my gun and slowly opened the door wider. I saw nothing. I carefully picked up a towel from the floor. Nothing . There must be someone in the bathroom, I thought.  

In one fell swoop, I kicked the shower curtain back . “Don’t move!” I shouted. 

Suddenly, a little white cat jumped out of the bath tub and scurried between my legs. A cat. I should have known. 

“Oh, Jasmine! I forgot about you!” Anne said. The c at looked happy to see her. She took her into the kitchen. I poked around the r est of the bedroom and then followed Anne into the kitchen. 

“Does the cat have any food left in her dish?” I as ked. 

“It’s almost gone. Poor Jasmine! You must be hungry .”  

“Well, Bill and Sarah haven’t been gone long, we kn ow that.” I walked over to the telephone answering machine and checked their messa ges. No one had called. 

We continued looking through the three-bedroom apar tment. There was no sign of any violence, no burglary, no break-in. I checke d the master bedroom, and I saw nothing unusual – a beer bottle, photos of Bill  and Sarah’s wedding, some dirty clothes, an old Time  magazine.  

Next to the bed, on the night table, there was a bo ttle of pills. “Anne, what are these pills for?” 

“I think they’re for Bill’s leg. He messed up his l eg playing football in college at USC,” Anne replied. 

I put the bottle back on the table and sat down on the bed to think. I had no idea what happened to Anne’s sister and her brother-in-l aw. They seem to have just disappeared into thin air. They didn’t call anyone.  There was no sign of any crime in their apartment. No one at their jobs had seen t hem for two days. Where could they be? 

“Well, Anne, I don’t see anything here to help us. I think we should talk to the police again.” 

“But I’ve tried the police, Dr. Reeves! They told m e to fill out some forms and wait. They won’t do anything. That’s why I went to you for help!” She began to cry a little. 

I stopped and looked at her for a second. God, I th ought, this poor kid. Twenty- two and in such pain.  

“Okay, well, we won’t find anything else here. Let’ s go,” I said to her. 

 Just then I heard a telephone ringing. I turned to the phone on the table, but there was no sound. Then I saw Anne reach into her purse: it was her cellular telephone! 

“That’s my cell phone, Dr. Reeves.” Anne said. “Hel lo?” 

I watched Anne’s face as she answered the phone. Fi rst it was happy, then worried, then very sad.  

“Right . . . 10 minutes . . . yes . . . see you the re . . . bye!” Anne hung up and looked at me in fear. 

“That was Bill. Something terrible has happened!” 

[end of story] 

In episode 4 of Missing Person , “Meeting at the Café,” we’ll learn more about thi s terrible thing that happened.
