This dialogue is between Richard and Elizabeth abou t acting – the ability, which I do not have, to performing in a play, a movie, or a  television show, or a podcast. Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Richard: It’s 6:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. Why ar e you banging those pots and pans? 

Elizabeth: I have an audition coming up and I’m reh earsing. 

Richard: By banging pots and pans? 

Elizabeth: I’m up for a part as a 1950s housewife. I need to learn my lines and be prepared to improvise. That’s why I’m cooking you a  10-course breakfast. I want to practice staying in character. 

Richard: I don’t really want a 10-course breakfast,  but if it helps you with your audition... 

Elizabeth: It will. I have to stretch my acting cho ps and really get into the head of the character. 

Richard: Right. Whatever you say. 

Elizabeth: “Yes, dear. Your breakfast will be ready  and waiting when you want it.” Did I project enough? Did I emote enough? 

Richard: You were great. What kind of acting job is  this?  

 Elizabeth: It’s a small one. 

Richard: In a film?  

Elizabeth: No. 

Richard: In a TV show? 

Elizabeth: Not exactly. 

Richard: What is it? 

Elizabeth: It’s a commercial. It’s only a bit part,  but you know what they say: “There are no small parts, only small actors!”

Richard begins this dialogue by asking Elizabeth so mething. He says first, “It’s 6:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. Why are you banging those pots and pans?” “Pots and pans” are things that you use to cook. Yo u might boil some water in a “pot” (pot) and fry some eggs in a “pan” (pan). The  question Richard has for Elizabeth is why she is banging pots and pans. “To bang” (bang) here means to make a loud noise with. Because pots and pans are b ig and often made of metal, if you move them around and hit them against other things, they may make a lot of noise.  

Elizabeth says, “I have an audition coming up and I ’m rehearsing.” An “audition” (audition) is also sometimes called a “tryout” (try out). What you do on an audition is go in front of the director of a play or a movie  or a television show, and you typically will act a little bit of the movie or par t of some scene – some dialogue that will show the person if you can act or not and  if you are the person who would be best for this particular part. A “part” (p art) here just means one of the characters in the play or the movie or the TV show.   

So, here in Los Angeles, for example, there are aud itions every day, in some part the city, for television shows and movies. People g o to these – actors and actresses go to these –  auditions to try to get in to the movie, to be part of the play or part of the television show. Sometimes it’s  just to be part of a commercial, an advertisement, but whatever it is, you usually h ave to go on an audition. Notice that phrasal verb “to go on.” You can “go on ” a trip, and you could “go on” an audition.  

 Elizabeth is going on an audition, and so she’s reh earsing. “To rehearse” (rehearse) means to practice, especially to practic e either a speech or a performance that you are going to be giving in a pl ay or some other dramatic setting. Richard asks Elizabeth why she is banging pots and pans as part of her rehearsing, and she says, “I’m up for a part as a 1 950s housewife.” We already explained what a “part” is when we’re talking about  plays and movies. It’s the character in the play or the movie or TV show.  

“To be up for” means to be under consideration for – one of the people that the people who are making the movie are considering, ar e thinking about. You have a good chance of getting it, or at least a chance o f getting it. Elizabeth is “up for a part as a 1950s housewife.” The word “housewife” (h ousewife) – one word – describes a woman who stays at home and takes care of the house and the children. Nowadays, of course, many women, at least  in the United States, work in addition perhaps to having a family.  

Elizabeth says, “I need to learn my lines and be pr epared to improvise.” Your “lines” (lines) are the words that you have to say in the movie or play. “To learn your lines,” then, means to memorize the words that  you have to say. Elizabeth is also preparing “to improvise.” “To improvise” (impr ovise) is to act or perform without having a prepared script, without having ba sically any lines prepared for you. You simply have to make it up as you go along.   

“Improvisation” is very popular nowadays in comedy.  There are a lot of comedic actors, comedians, who do what we call “improv” (im prov), which is short for “improvisation,” which comes from the verb “to impr ovise” – to make something up as you go along without having planned it before . 

Elizabeth says, “That’s why I’m cooking you a 10-co urse breakfast. I want to practice staying in character.” Elizabeth is cookin g Richard a “10-course (course) breakfast.” A “course,” when we’re talking about a meal, is a part of a meal. So, if you go to a nice restaurant, you may have a three-c ourse meal. The first course may be a salad or a bowl of soup. The second course  may be a piece of chicken or fish. The third course may be some vegetable or perhaps a dessert, something sweet. That would be a “three-course meal .”  

Elizabeth is preparing Richard a “10-course breakfa st,” which is quite unusual. No one that I know eats 10 different things for bre akfast. Elizabeth says that she wants “to practice staying in character.” “To be in  character” means to be acting like the person in the play or the movie. So, “to s tay in character” means to  

continue acting like the person in the movie even t hough you’re not filming the movie right now, even though you’re not part of the  play or the production.  

This is a common technique by some actors. It’s a m ethod which is sometimes called “method acting,” in which the actor continue s to act like the person in the movie or play even though they are at home with the ir wife and children. There are some actors who are very famous for this partic ular technique or approach. Daniel Day-Lewis, for example, the great Irish acto r, is famous for staying in character when he’s making a movie – acting like th e character, like the person in the movie, even when he’s not in front of the ca mera, even when they are not filming.  

Richard says, “I don’t really want a 10-course brea kfast, but if it helps with your audition…” Richard is saying well, you don’t have t o cook me a 10-course breakfast, but I’ll eat it if it will help you. Eli zabeth says, “It will” – it will help her. She says, “I have to stretch my acting chops and re ally get into the head of the character.”  

Your “acting chops” (chops) are your acting abiliti es. “To stretch (stretch) your acting chops” is to expand and improve them, to mak e them work in situations in which you are not normally using them. The verb “to  stretch” usually means to make something longer, but here it’s used to mean t o improve or expand. Elizabeth is trying to “get into the head of the ch aracter” that she is perhaps playing or going to play in this performance. “To g et into the head (head) of” someone means to really understand that person, to understand how that person thinks.  

One of the most important things for someone who is  selling something to you, someone who is marketing a product or service, is t o “get into the head” or “get inside the head” of the person who’s buying that pr oduct or who might buy that product. This is something that actors also try to do. Richard says, “Right. Whatever you say.” Richard isn’t really all that co ncerned with Elizabeth’s logic or reasoning here.  

Elizabeth responds to Richard, now in character – s he’s acting like the housewife from the 1950s. She says, “Yes, dear.” “Dear” (dear ) is a word that you would use with someone with whom you are in love. It’s a word you might use with your wife or your husband. It’s a little bit old-fashion ed. In fact, that’s why Elizabeth is using it. She’s trying to sound like someone from t he 1950s. And, of course, the expression, “Yes, dear” is meant to give you the id ea that the wife will agree with whatever the husband says. That’s the idea that Eli zabeth is trying to convey here, or get us to understand.   

 She says, “Your breakfast will be ready and waiting  when you want it.” Elizabeth then asks Richard, “Did I project enough? Did I emo te enough?” “To project” (project) is to speak loudly and clearly. “To emote ” (emote) is to show emotions or feelings when you’re acting. Elizabeth is asking  Richard if she did a good job saying the sentences, “Yes, dear. Your breakfast wi ll be ready and waiting when you want it.”  

Richard says, “You were great. What kind of acting job is this?” Elizabeth says, “It’s a small one.” The acting job that she’s tryin g to get is not something that is very important or big. Richard asks, “In a film?” E lizabeth says, “No.” “In a TV show?” Elizabeth says, “Not exactly.” Richard then says, “What is it?” What kind of role is this? What kind of part is this? Elizabe th says, “It’s a commercial” – it’s an advertisement. She says, “It’s only a bit part,”  meaning it’s only a small part, “but you know what they say: ‘There are no small pa rts, only small actors!’”  

The expression “you know what they say” is used whe n you are going to use some common expression or common saying or popular expression. The popular expression that is used in acting sometimes is, “Th ere are no small parts, only small actors.” The idea behind the expression is th at it’s not important how big a role or part you have in a performance. A talented actor can demonstrate his or her skills even in a small role and can improve the  quality of the performance.  

So, Elizabeth is going to be playing, perhaps, in a  commercial. But remember, here in Los Angeles, there are thousands of actors and actresses trying to get jobs, and so even a job in a commercial is better t han a job working at a café or a restaurant, which is where most actors and actresse s work here in L.A.  

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
