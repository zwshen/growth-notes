<h1>Problem A</h1>
<h2>Airplane Scheduling</h2>
</center>

<p>Most airports have a big flat land for airplanes to land and take off. 
Here is an example, where the flat land is divided into 4 rows and 5 columns. 
Gray squares are places to land and take off, black squares are obstacles, and 
squares with numbers are parking spaces.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="p11208.png" /></p>

<p>Each airplane is assigned to a parking space. It can choose an arbitrary gray 
square to land on, then goes to its assigned parking space by a sequence of horizontal 
and vertical movements (each movement is moving one square north, south, east or west). 
It cannot move diagonally, nor can it move into an obstacle square or a parking space 
that is occupied by another airplane. Empty squares without numbers are always free to 
move on. After reaching its assigned parking space, the airplane waits until it's time 
for it to take off.  Then, it goes to an arbitrary gray square to take off (not necessarily 
the one it landed on). Initially the flat land is empty. An assignment is feasible if every 
landing and taking off can be accomplished. Note that different planes might be assigned to 
the same parking space, as long as the schedule is feasible.</p>

<p>The event list is represented by a sequence of integers, where positive means 
landing, negative means taking off. It is guaranteed that each plane lands and takes 
off exactly once (at the end, the flat land is empty again). </p>

<p>For example, the event list +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1 has a 
feasible assignment 12, 09, 05, 06, 02, 10, which are the parking spaces assigned to 
airplane 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively. </p>

<p>Write a program to assign parking spaces to airplanes.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
The input consists of at most 20 test cases. Each case begins with a line containing 
<i>n</i>, <i>r</i> and <i>c</i> (0 < <i>n</i> < 21, 2 < <i>r</i>, <i>c</i> < 11), where <i>n</i> is the number of airplanes, <i>r</i> and <i>c</i> are the 
number of rows and columns of the flat land. The next <i>r</i> lines each contains <i>c</i> pairs of 
characters separated by a single space. Each pair is either a landing space(==), an empty 
space(..), an obstacle square(##) or a parking space(two digits). Different parking spaces 
have different numbers. The last case is followed by a single zero, which should not be processed.

<h2>Output</h2>
For each test case, print the case number and whether there is a solution. If there is, 
the second line should contain <i>n</i> two-digit integers (with leading zeros if any), 
the assigned parking space number of the corresponding airplane. If more than one solution 
exists, any one is acceptable. 

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
6 4 5
01 .. == .. 02
03 04 .. 05 06
07 08 .. ## 09
10 11 .. .. 12
+1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
3 3 3
== .. 01
.. ## 02
.. ## 03
+1 +2 +3 -3 -1 -2
0
</pre>

<h2>Output for the Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
Case 1: Yes
12 09 05 06 02 10

Case 2: No
