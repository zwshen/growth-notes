<P>
The gourmet club of ACM City has 16 members. They contracted the proprietor of the local 
French restaurant Chateau Java to arrange dinner parties for 5 consecutive evenings. They asked 
to be seated around 4 tables, 4 persons per table. They also stipulated that during the 5 evenings, 
every member of the club will share a table exactly once with each member of the club. Mr. I.B. 
Emm, the restaurateur, assigned his Maitre D' the task of scheduling the seating for the 5 
evenings. 

<P>
On the first evening, the Maitre D'’ seated the members as they arrived and recorded 
their seating. Each subsequent evening, he carefully planned the seating to match the 
requirement that no member will be dining twice with some other member.  Unfortunately, the 
Maitre D'’ disappeared on the morning of the fourth evening. Mr. Emm was left only with his notes 
which included the recorded seating arrangements during the previous 3 evenings. As he was 
trying to schedule the seating for the remaining evenings, it dawned on him that this task may not 
be that easy. He is asking for your help to try and see whether the remaining two evenings can be 
scheduled.  The following is a sample of the Maitre D's seating arrangements during the first 3 evenings:

<P>
The members of the gourmet club were identified by the letters <TT>A,B,C,...,P</TT>.
  
Each line represents one evening of seating with each set of four letters a single table. Thus on 
the first evening <TT>A</TT> dines with <TT>B</TT>, <TT>C</TT> and <TT>D</TT>, etc.   Write a program that will read from the input file the 
seating arrangement  of the first three evenings and will either complete the schedule or 
determine that the Maitre D'’ screwed up.

<P>

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
Input will be a text file. Each data set will be 3 lines. Each line will consist of four blocks, each 4 
letters long. All letters will be in upper case. Blocks will be separated by ``white spaces". Data sets
will be separated by blank lines.

<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For a successful schedule, echo the input (including extra white spaces) and add two lines
showing the successful schedule.  If it is not possible to complete the schedule, do not echo the 
input, but print ``<TT>It is not possible to complete this schedule.</TT>"  

<P>
Separate output for each data set with a blank line.
