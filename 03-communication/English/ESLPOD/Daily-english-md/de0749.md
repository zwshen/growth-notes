This episode is a dialogue between Judith and Steve n about going to the doctor and getting some results from some tests that the d octor performs on you. Sounds like fun!  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Judith:  I had my annual physical two weeks ago and  I just got a copy of the lab results, but I can’t figure out what they mean. 

Steven:  Let me take a look.  The results of your b lood tests are good.  Your cholesterol is within the normal range, your glucos e levels are fine, your hormone levels are good, and your red and white blood cell counts are normal, too.   

Judith:  That’s good news.   

Steven:  You did well on your EKG stress test and y our bone density scan is fine. 

Judith:  Really?  That’s great.  What about the oth er results? 

Steven:  There appears to be no problems with your Pap smear or mammogram results, either. 

Judith:  I’m really glad to hear that.  I hate goin g through those exams.  I’m glad I don’t have to do them more often.   

Steven:  Just be glad you’re not a man.   

Judith:  Why’s that?   

Steven:  If you were a man, you’d have to have a PS A…and a DRE. 

Judith:  A what? 

Steven:  You don’t want to know.

Judith has gone to the doctor, and she gets some te st results back from the doctor.  She said, “I had my annual physical two we eks ago and I just got a copy of the lab results, but I can’t figure out what the y mean.”  The word “annual” (annual) means once per year.  A “physical” is shor t for a physical examination; it’s usually something you have a doctor do once a year to check to make sure that you are healthy, that there are no new medical  problems.  Instead of “physical exam” sometimes we just say “physical”: “ I need to get a physical.” That’s what the “physical” is; it’s the examination .  “Physical” has other meanings in English as well, and those can be found in the w onderful Learning Guide for this episode. 

Judith says that she got a copy of the lab results.   “Lab” (lab) is short for laboratory; it’s the place where things are tested by scientists.  And, “lab results” are the results of tests that were sent to a labora tory in order to analyze them. Steven says, “Let me take a look.”  “Let me take a look” means let me look at them; let me examine them.  He says, “The results o f your blood tests are good.” “Blood tests” are when they take blood – red blood – out of you and they test it for certain problems or certain things.  Steven say s that Judith’s cholesterol is within the normal range, her glucose levels are fin e, her hormone levels are good, and her red and white blood cell counts are n ormal, also.  “Cholesterol” is a fatty substance that when it goes into your blood stream – into your arteries – it can be dangerous.  It can prevent the blood from fl owing through, at least that’s my understanding.  I’m not a real doctor of course;  I just have a Ph.D.  But, I looked it up on the Internet; I think that’s right.   A “range” (range) here means a number of numbers or levels.  One is a minimum, one  is a maximum, between which your score or the number of your test should fall.  So, we might say that, for example, if you take an intelligent quotient te st – an IQ test – the average result may be 100, but anything between, I don’t kn ow, 90 and 110 might be considered the normal range, where most people woul d be.  So, “range” has to do with a low number, a high number, and the number s in between.  The cholesterol levels of Judith are within the normal range, meaning that she’s like most people; her cholesterol isn’t too high, it isn ’t too low, it’s just right.    

 “Glucose” (glucose) is a type of sugar that’s found  in the blood, and is used by the blood as – or the body, rather, as a source of energy.  So, in measuring your glucose level, the doctor is measuring the amount o f that sugar, making sure it’s not too high or too low – or too sweet.  No, just k idding, not that kind of sugar. “Hormones” are substances in your body that affect a lot of different things.  They affect your sexual development, they can affect lot s of different parts of the way your body functions.  Men and women have different kinds or different levels of different hormones, and so you need to make sure yo u, uh, have the right level of the different hormones, and it sounds like Judith d oes.  She also has good red and white blood cell counts.  A “blood cell” is the  smallest unit – the smallest part of what we call blood.  A “count” is a number, how many of them are there.  If you go on a tour with the group of people, and then you  come back to the bus after the tour, the tour director – the leader – might do  a head count, might count the number of people there to make sure that everyone’s  head and body is present. Well, this is a blood cell count, finding out how m any blood cells that Judith has, and it turns out that they are in normal range as w ell. 

Judith says, “That’s good news.”  Steven says, “You  did well on the EKG stress test and your bone density scan is fine.  An “EKG” is an electrocardiography test. “Stress” is normally when you are pushing your body  to do perhaps more than it normally does; “stress” can also be anxiety, nervou sness, worry.  But here, it really refers to using an exercise machine to get y our heart working so that the doctors can measure how well your heart is pumping – how well it’s working. This is called an “EKG stress test.”  A “bone densi ty scan” refers to a test where they use a machine that goes over your body.  You c an keep your clothes on; you don’t have to take them off – for now!  Don’t t ake them off while listening to the podcast anyway please.  As a general rule, we a sk you to keep your clothes on while listening to the podcast.  Anyway, this, u h, machine goes over your body and it’s looking to see whether your “bones,” the h ard, white material under your skin – whether the bone has the correct amount of c ertain substances, whether they are becoming soft or not.  If they are, then t his can be an indication of problems.   

So, Judith’s bone density scan was fine.  Judith sa ys, “That’s great.  What about the other results?”  Steven says, “There appears to  be no problems with your Pap (pap) smear (smear) or mammogram.”  Well, let’s  start with Pap smear.  I’ve never actually had a Pap smear; I don’t think I eve r will.  Why?  Well, it is an examination that is only done on women, and it take s a sample from their…we’ll call it their internal reproductive organs – look t hat up if you don’t know what those are on a woman – and makes sure that there is  no sign of cancer for that organ.  “Pap” stands for…something.  I don’t…I have  the word in front of me  

here; I don’t how to pronounce it.  I’ve never seen  it before, I’m sorry.  It doesn’t really matter; everyone calls it a Pap smear.  A “m ammogram” (mammogram) is also something I will probably never have.  It is a n x-ray of a woman’s breasts, those things that are on the top of a woman’s chest .  It’s used to make sure the woman doesn’t have cancer in the breasts. 

Steven says that her Pap smear and mammogram result s were just fine, no problems.  Judith says she’s glad to hear that.  Sh e says, “I hate going through those exams (or going to those exams).  I’m glad I don’t have to do them more often.”  Steven says, “Just be glad you’re not a ma n.”  Judith asks, “Why’s that?” Steven says, “If you were a man, you’d have to do a  PSA…and a DRE.”  Judith says, “A what?” and Steven replies, “You don’t want  to know,” meaning it’s better that I don’t tell you.  Well, I will tell you, howe ver.  PSA and DRE are exams that are typically only done on men, just like Pap smear s and mammograms are only done on women.  “PSA” stands for prostate specific antigen, and only men have a prostate.  It’s a test to make sure that the pros tate is healthy and that there is no sign of cancer.  It’s currently recommended, I b elieve, that men over the age of 50 have regular PSA examinations so that if ther e is a problem they can find it early – a problem with cancer.  A “DRE” is a digita l rectal exam.  Let’s talk about that.  “Digital” is your finger; “rectal” is, well,  when you’re sitting on the toilet the things that come out of your body come through some thing called a “rectum” (rectum).  So, “rectal” is an adjective that descri bes the rectum.  So, you put those two things together, literally your finger an d rectal, and you get the digital rectal exam, where the doctor places one of his dig its – one of his fingers – in the rectal area.  We’ll just leave it at that! 

And now, we’ll listen to the dialogue at a normal s peed.
