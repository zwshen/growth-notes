This episode is a dialogue between Andy and Sita ab out responsibilities in the workplace. Let’s get started.

[start of dialog]

Andy:  What are you doing?

Sita:  I’m running some numbers for the new project .

Andy:  I thought that was Delia’s turf.

Sita:  She’s usually the go-to person for this type  of information, but I need this info right now.

Andy:  I’d be careful about stepping on Delia’s toe s.  She doesn’t take kindly to people encroaching on her responsibilities.

Sita:  I know she can be territorial at times, but I’m sure if I explain to her why I’m getting this information right this minute, she’d u nderstand.

Andy:  Okay, but don’t be surprised if she thinks y ou’re trying to gain control of her little fiefdom.  She’s really entrenched and sh e doesn’t like anyone muscling in.

Sita:  Do you really think she’ll misunderstand my motives?

Andy:  I wouldn’t take any chances.  Hurry up and f inish what you’re doing, cover your tracks, and get out.  With any luck, she won’t  think this is the beginning of a turf war.

Andy begins by asking Sita, “What are you doing?” S ita says, “I'm running some numbers on the new project.” “To run some numbers,”  or “to run the  numbers,” means to do some sort of mathematical calculation, to analyze data, to analyze information in the form of numbers. Sometimes we’ll  say, “I'm going to run the numbers.” We might also say, “I'm going to crunch ( crunch) the numbers.” Both of these are terms used in the business world to de scribe the activity of analyzing information using some sort of calculation, some so rt of statistical analysis.

Andy says, “I thought that was Delia’s turf.” “Turf ” (turf) means the area that you believe you have control over. It can also mean ter ritory. The word “territory” (territory) is usually used in talking about countr ies – what territory belongs to this country, what area of land belongs to this country.  However, it could also be used in a “smaller sense,” we could say, talking about r esponsibilities at work. Well, this is my territory. This is my turf. This is the area that I feel responsible for, that I am responsible for. The word “turf” usually is us ed to imply that someone feels strongly about the area that they have responsibili ty for, and doesn't want anyone else interfering.

Sita says “She” – meaning Delia – “is usually the g o to person for this type of information, but I need this info right now.” The e xpression “go-to person” means the person who you would normally ask to do a certa in task because that person is an expert, that person is the best person to do that. Sita says that Delia is normally the person who would crunch or “run the nu mbers,” but she needs this “info” – this information – “right now.” Sita can't  wait for Delia to do the analysis, so she is doing it herself.

Andy says, “I'd be careful about stepping on Delia' s toes.” “To step on someone's toes” (toes) means to interfere with their area of responsibility, to become involved in someone else's work when that other per son doesn't want you to be involved. So, for example, if I am supposed to orga nize a meeting, and you decide that you're going to help me organize the me eting even though I don't want you to, that would be a case of you “stepping on my toes.” Your “toes” are the digits that are on your feet. You have fingers on your hands. On your feet, you have toes. The phrasal verb “to step on” means to put your foot on top of. “To step on someone's toes,” then, is a metaphor, m eaning to get in someone's way, to interfere with someone else's responsibilit ies.

Andy says, “Delia doesn't take kindly to people enc roaching on her responsibilities.” The expression “does not take ki ndly to” means dislikes, resents, does not like something, is very uncomfort able with something. You

don't hear this expression too frequently, but you will still read it and hear it, about someone “not taking kindly to” some action th at another person does. In this case, Delia does not take kindly to people “en croaching on her responsibilities.” “To encroach” (encroach) means t o become involved in something that belongs to someone else, to become i nvolved in some activity that another person is responsible for. It's very s imilar to the phrase “to step on someone's toes.” “To encroach” means to start to mo ve in someone else turf, especially when we're talking about a work environm ent. Delia does not take kindly to other people encroaching on her responsib ilities, taking over for responsibilities.

Sita says, “I know she can be territorial at times. ” Sita says that Delia can be “territorial” (territorial). “To be territorial” is  related to the noun “territory.” The idea that this is my area of responsibility, this is my turf, and I don't want anyone else interfering with me. Sita says, “I'm sure if I expl ained to her” – to Delia – “why I'm getting this information right this minute, she'd u nderstand.” “Right this minute” means right now, immediately, right away. “I need t his information right this minute.” I need this information now .

Andy says, “Okay, but don't be surprised if she thi nks you're trying to gain control of her little fiefdom.” “To gain control” means to have power over someone or something, usually power that you get by taking it from another person. So, you have someone at your work who is responsible for the annual meeting with your entire company. You try to gain control of that job , of that task, of that responsibility, by taking over the power from that person.

The word “fiefdom” (fiefdom) refers to an area of l and belonging to someone with a lot of power. It's an old word that describes a s ystem, common in the Middle Ages in Europe, called “feudalism” (feudalism). Feu dalism involved receiving land and protection from a very wealthy person in e xchange for working for that person or giving some sort of service to that perso n. Here, and in modern usage, “fiefdom” refers to an area that you are responsibl e for and that you are very territorial about, an area of responsibility that y ou don't want anyone else interfering with.

Andy says, “Delia is really entrenched and she does n't like anyone muscling in.” “To be entrenched” (entrenched) means you are unlik ely to change. You have your established ways, the ways you do things, and you're not going to change for anyone. That's me. I'm very entrenched in some of my ideas! Well, Andy says, Delia is entrenched, “and she doesn't like an yone muscling in.” “To muscle (muscle) in” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to go into someone else's space, someone else's area of responsibility, in th is case. It can literally mean to

use physical force to get into someone's territory or someone's area, but here it means something like gaining control of someone els e's responsibility, by using some sort of pressure, using some tactic that allow s you to gain control even if the other person doesn't want you to.

Sita says, “Do you really think she'll misunderstan d” – or not understand – “my motives?” Your “motive” is your motivation, your re ason for doing something. Andy says, “I wouldn't take any chances,” meaning y ou shouldn't try to do this unless you're absolutely sure. You shouldn't risk a nything. He says, “Hurry up and finish what you're doing, cover your tracks, an d get out.” “To cover your tracks” (tracks) means to remove evidence so that o ther people don't know where you've been or what you have done. We use thi s expression when someone is doing something wrong and you don't want  anyone else to know about it, so you're going to hide the evidence or g et rid of any indication that you were there or that you did something wrong.

Andy says, “With any luck” – if you're lucky – “she  won't think this is the beginning of a turf war.” A “turf war” is when two different people or two different groups are fighting each other for responsibility of a certain task, usually in a large organization such as a company.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
