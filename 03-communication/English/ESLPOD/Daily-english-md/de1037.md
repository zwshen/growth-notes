This episode is a dialogue between Gunther and Mari a about stopping, or ending, a party. Doesn’t sound like too much fun, d oes it? Well, let’s join the party and find out.

Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gunther: I think this party has run its course, and  I’m ready to call it a night.

Maria: But there are still a few stragglers who see m reluctant to leave. How do we politely tell them to go home?

Gunther: I’ll just make an announcement.

Maria: Wait! That seems kind of rude. Let me try a few hints. I’ll tell them that we’re out of drinks.

Gunther: If you do that, one of those guys is liabl e to offer to make a beer run. That’s not going to do the trick.

Maria: What if I go over there, yawn, and comment o n the lateness of the hour? That should be obvious enough without being too rud e.

Gunther: Those people aren’t going to respond to su btlety. Let me handle this.

Maria: What are you going to do?

Gunther: I’m going to do what bars do at closing ti me. I’m turning up the lights and turning off the music.

Maria: And if that doesn’t work?

Gunther: I’m going to yell “Lights out, people!” an d mean it!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Gunther saying to Maria, “ I think this party has run its course and I’mready to call it a night.” There are two expressions or phrases in this first line of the dialogue that we want to exp lain. The first one is for something “to run its course” (course). “To run its  course” means that something has naturally completed whatever process or perhaps  cycle is involved here. It really means that the party is no longer entertaini ng. It’s no longer fun. It’s coming to an end. You had a good time, but now it’s  time to go. That’s the idea that Gunther is trying to communicate here.

The phrase “to run its course” is often used in med icine to talk about, for example, a disease or an illness that is temporary.  There are some illnesses, such as the common cold and flu, that sometimes jus t have to run their course. They are not illnesses that are easy to cure or eve n to help, sometimes. You just have to let the disease go through its stages until  it’s all over.

The other expression from this first line that I wa nt to explain is “to call it a night.” “To call it a night” means to say that you are goin g home. You are not going to stay at whatever event or party you are at. So, if you go to someone’s house for dinner and you stay until 10 o’clock or 11 o’clock and then you want to go, you would say to the person, “I think I’m going to call  it a night,” meaning I’m going to leave now and go home. I don’t want to be here anym ore.

Maria says, “But there are still a few stragglers w ho seem reluctant to leave. How do we politely tell them to go home?” We realize in  this second line of the dialogue that Maria and Gunther are having a party at their own house. Maria says there are still a few “stragglers” (stragglers ). A “straggler” is one of the last people to finish something, or one of the last few people to continue doing something.

Let’s say you go on a tour and the tour bus leaves at eight o’clock in the morning. You get there at 7:45, and at eight o’clock, the bu s is ready to leave, but some people have not yet arrived from your group. So the y come in at 8:05 or 8:10. We would call those final few people the “stragglers.”  There’s sometimes a negative

connotation about this word “straggler.” It suggest s that the person is late or is very slow.

Maria says these few stragglers seem reluctant to l eave. “To be reluctant” (reluctant) means to not want to do something, to n ot look forward to doing something. We might also say that it means “to be h esitant” (hesitant). The stragglers are reluctant to leave. You could be rel uctant to go to school. You could be reluctant to go to your mother-in-law’s ho use. These are all very logical, perhaps even common, experiences. Maria says, “How do we politely tell them to go home?” To do something “politely” (politely) mea ns nicely, courteously, with good manners.

Gunther says, “I’ll make an announcement”; I’ll jus t tell everybody. Maria says, “Wait!” meaning stop. “That seems kind of rude” – n ot nice. “Let me try a few hints.” A “hint” (hint) is, in this case, a gentle suggestion, an indication about what you are talking about or what you want without sayi ng it directly. A “hint” in other context can also mean a clue – information about so me mystery or problem. Here, however, it just means an indirect way of com municating a message.

Maria says that she’ll tell her guests that they are out of drinks – they have no more alcohol, let’s say, to drink. Gunther says, “I f you do that, one of those guys is liable to offer to make a beer run.” The word “l iable” (liable) here means likely or probable, something that could and probably will  happen. “Liable” also has some other meanings that are related to the law. “T o be liable” for something means to be responsible for something, often financ ially responsible for something, but here it just means “likely.”

One of the guys, according to Gunther, is likely “t o offer to make a beer run.” A “beer (beer) run” is a quick trip to a store, a liq uor store, to buy more beer. We sometimes use that word “run” to talk about doing a  very short trip for one specific purpose, often to buy something. If it’s e ight o’clock at night and you’re feeling hungry, you might say to your husband, “Let ’s go for a doughnut run.” That would mean let’s go out and buy some doughnuts , which sounds really good right now. But again, so does a beer.

Gunther says, “That’s not going to do the trick.” “ To do the trick” means to be successful, to reach your goal or objective. Gunthe r is saying that telling their guests that they have run out of drinks will not be  effective. That won’t work. It won’t do the trick (trick).

Maria then makes another suggestion to Gunther: “What if I go over there,” where the people are standing, “yawn, and comment o n the lateness of the

hour?” “To yawn” (yawn) is to open your mouth wide and take a deep breath, usually sighing outwards. It’s better and easier to  simply illustrate this. A “yawn” would be something like [yawns]. Interestingly enou gh, I believe that when one person yawns, it often causes other people to yawn.  So, if you just yawned yourself, well, there you go. It did the trick.

Maria is going to yawn because when someone yawns, it often indicates that he is tired. She’s going to try to indicate to her gue sts that it’s getting late. In fact, she’s going to “comment on the lateness of the hour .” The “lateness of the hour” simply means how late it is getting, how it is time  for people to go home and go to sleep. Maria says that should be obvious enough wit hout being too rude.

Gunther says, “Those people aren’t going to respond  to subtlety.” “Subtlety” (subtlety) is being very indirect. “Subtlety” is in directness, not being direct with someone. It’s similar to hinting. Gunther says, “Le t me handle this,” meaning let me take care of this. Maria then asks, “What are yo u going to do?” Gunther says, “I’m going to do what bars do at closing time.” A “ bar” is a place where you go and get an alcoholic drink. He says, “I’m turning u p the lights and turning off the music.”

Sometimes in a bar, when they are ready to close, t he owners will turn off the music and turn up the lights. Some lights can be ma de to be less bright, and that’s the case in a bar. Usually, if you go into a  bar, there aren’t really bright lights shining on you – that’s because people are d rinking, and they don’t want to see bright lights. “To turn up the lights” would be  to go from the room being sort of dark to suddenly being very bright.

Maria says, “And if that doesn’t work? Gunther says , “I’m going to yell” – say very loudly – “‘Lights out, people!’ and mean it.” “Ligh ts out” means that it’s time to go to sleep, to turn off the lights and go to sleep. I t’s something that, for example, a father or mother might say to his or her children w hen it’s time for them to go to bed. The parent might send the child to his room an d then turn the lights off and say something like “Lights out,” meaning it’s time to turn the lights off. You might also hear that expression in the military when it’s  time for everyone to go to bed, to go to sleep.

Gunther says he’s “going to yell ‘Lights out people !’ and mean it.” “To mean” (mean) something means to really believe it, to act ually do what you say you are going to do. We sometimes use this phrase when some one doesn’t believe that you are going to do what you say you’re going to do . So, a parent may say again to his or her child, “If you don’t go to sleep righ t now, you’re not going to get any candy tomorrow. I mean it.” The parent is emphasizi ng that he or she is serious

and will actually do what he or she says that he or  she will do. Wives also speak this way sometimes to their husbands.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nor mal speed.
