This dialogue is about breaking bad habits – trying  to stop doing things that you have been doing probably for a long time, but that are bad for you. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Counselor: Welcome, everybody. You’ve all joined th is support group because you have some bad habits that you’d like to break. Would anyone like to introduce themselves and tell us about their bad ha bit?

Stu: Uh yeah, I’m Stu and my wife signed me up for this support group because she says I have some really bad habits. One of my w orst is my nail biting. You can see that they’re pretty ragged.

Counselor: Thank you, Stu. Is there anyone else . .  .?

Stu: Oh yeah, I also smack my gum. That drives my w ife crazy, so I try not to do it in her presence.

Counselor: Well, thanks for sharing, Stu. If we cou ld move on to . . .

Stu: I also tend to tap my fingers and crack my joi nts, which my wife says is really annoying, though her hair twirling is pretty annoyi ng to me.

Counselor: Stu? Let’s let a few other people . . .

Stu: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention what my wife says  is my most annoying bad habit.

Counselor: What is that?

Stu: I tend to interrupt people in conversation.

Counselor: Really? I hadn’t noticed.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the counselor – the person  who is providing advice and guidance to people – welcoming everyone to this gro up. We’re in some sort of group counseling session, and so the leader of the group is called the “counselor” (counselor). Someone who is called a “c ounselor” in a situation like this typically will have some training in how to he lp people, but not quite as much as a regular psychologist or psychiatrist.

The counselor says, “Welcome everybody. You’ve all joined this support group because you have some bad habits that you’d like to  break.” A “support group” is a group of people who have similar problems or chal lenges and who want help from other people in similar situations. Sometimes talking to other people who have the same problem or issue that you have can he lp you.

“Bad habits” are things that you do over and over a gain, often without thinking about it very much, that have negative consequences  for you, that are bad for you. Some people might say smoking cigarettes is a bad habit. It’s a difficult habit to break, however. “To break (break) a habit” means  to stop doing the habit – to no longer do it. Of course, you can also have “good  habits,” things that you do every day or frequently that are good for you. Brus hing your teeth and taking a shower, those are good habits – things that are goo d for you.

The whole idea of good habits and bad habits goes b ack at least to the time of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who wrote a book c alled The Ethics , about the formation of good and bad habits – “moral habits” a nd “intellectual habits,” as he called them – but we’re not going to talk about Ari stotle today. We’re going to talk about the support group that is helping people brea k bad habits.

The counselor says, “Would anyone like to introduce  themselves and tell us about their bad habit?” Would anyone like to tell u s their name and tell us what their bad habit is? Stu says, “Uh yeah, I’m Stu and  my wife signed me up for this support group because she says I have some really b ad habits.” Poor Stu. Stu doesn’t think, apparently, he has bad habits, but h is wife thinks that he has some bad habits. So, his loving wife “signed him up” for  this support group. “To sign someone up” is a phrasal verb meaning to put someon e’s name on a list saying that they will participate in a certain activity. A nother verb we could use here is “to enroll” (enroll).

 Stu’s wife has signed him up for this support group  because his wife thinks that he has “some really bad habits.” Of course, all wiv es think that their husbands have really bad habits. That’s part of being a wife . I’m just kidding, of course, honey. Stu says, “One of my worst” – meaning one of  my worst habits – “is nail biting.” Your “nail” (nail) is a part of your hand.  At the end of each finger, you have “nails” (nails). “To bite” (bite) means to use  your teeth to eat or to break something.

In this case, Stu is biting his nails, which some p eople believe is a bad habit. People bite their fingernails, in particular. I gue ss you could bite your toenails also, but that would be very difficult for most peo ple. Stu says, “You can see” – he’s showing the group his fingernails – “that they ’re pretty ragged.” “To be ragged” (ragged) means to be uneven, to be not smoo th. He’s showing the group his fingernails and indicating that yes, he does in  fact bite his nails. The counselor says, “Thank you, Stu. Is there anyone el se?” But Stu isn’t finished talking. Stu says, “Oh yeah, I also smack my gum. T hat drives my wife crazy, so I try not to do it in her presence.”

“Gum” (gum) refers to bubblegum or chewing gum, som ething you put in your mouth, that is usually flavored, and you chew it – you bite down on it, up and down with your teeth – to get the flavor out of the  gum. “To smack (smack) your gum” means to make loud noises or sounds while you are chewing your gum. I don’t have any gum in my mouth right now, so I can’ t demonstrate. Stu says that this smacking of his gum drives his wife crazy, mea ning it makes his wife angry or upset. He tries not to smack his gum “in her pre sence,” meaning when his wife is there with him.

The counselor says, “Well, thanks for sharing, Stu. ” “To share” (share) means to talk about something with other people, especially to talk about your experiences or your opinions about something. We sometimes use that verb sarcastically when someone is telling us something that we don’t really want to know, perhaps because it’s too personal. We might say to that per son, “Thanks for sharing,” meaning I didn’t really want you to tell me that. I t’s kind of an insulting thing to say.

Stu isn’t being insulted by the counselor. The coun selor simply wants someone else to talk. That’s why she says, “If we could mov e on to . . .” “To move on to” something or someone means to go to someone else – in this case, to have someone else talk about their bad habits, not Stu. But Stu isn’t finished. He says, “I also tend to tap my fingers and crack my joints,  which my wife says is really

annoying. “To tend (tend) to” do something is to of ten do something, especially when you’re not thinking about it.

Stu tends “to tap” (tap) his fingers. “To tap your fingers” is to hit one or more of your fingers against a table or something else, usu ally several times, over and over again, making a small noise. People sometimes tap their fingers at a meeting when they’re bored, which is to say at almo st every meeting. This is considered by some to be a bad habit.

Stu also cracks his joints. “To crack (crack) your joints (joints)” is to move or bend a part of your body that connects two bones. Usuall y we talk about cracking our “knuckles” (knuckles). Your knuckles are the parts of your hand that connect the fingers to the main part of your hand. “To crack yo ur knuckles” – I’m not sure if I can do this anymore – is to bend your hands in such  a way that they make a sound. Cracking your knuckles, or cracking your joi nts, is to move your bones in such a way that they make a noise – like that.

Stu’s wife finds this very annoying. Something that  is “annoying” (annoying) is something that is irritating, something that bother s you, Stu says that his wife’s hair twirling is pretty annoying to him, as well. “ To twirl (twirl) your hair” is to take a small section of your hair and move it around in circles with your finger, especially when you’re bored or distracted. It’s so mething that you usually will see with girls and women, because they typically ha ve longer hair.

I remember when I was teaching high school many yea rs ago. (Yes, I taught high school many years ago. It’s kind of scary.) The you ng girls in my classes would often twirl their hair because they were bored by m y lectures, by my presentations, which I can understand. Stu’s wife t wirls her hair, and that is annoying to Stu. The counselor says, “Stu, let’s le t a few other people . . .” She’s about to say, “Let’s let a few other people talk,” but Stu doesn’t wait long enough for her to finish her sentence.

Stu continues talking. He says, “Oh yeah, I forgot to mention what my wife says is my most annoying habit.” The counselor says, “What is that?” Stu says, “I tend to interrupt people in conversation.” “To interrupt ” (interrupt) is to speak when someone else is still speaking, before they have ha d a chance to finish what they want to say. That, of course, is exactly what Stu is doing here with the counselor.

The counselor then makes a joke at the end. She say s, “Really? I hadn’t noticed,” meaning I didn’t even realize that you ha ve this bad habit of interrupting. Of course, she did, and that’s why sh e’s saying this in a sarcastic way, in a joking way.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
