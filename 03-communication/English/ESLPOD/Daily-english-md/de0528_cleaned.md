This episode is called “Negotiating Salary.”  It’s a dial ogue between Renaldo and Simone.  They’re going to be talking about someone who  may be interested in taking a job, but they first want to get a good salary (“salary” being the money that you’re paid for your job).  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Renaldo:  Hello, may I speak to Simone Otto?   

Simone:  This is Simone.  May I ask who’s calling? 

Renaldo:  This is Renaldo Garcia at Cinetect.  You int erviewed for a position with me last week. 

Simone:  Oh, yes, of course.  How are you? 

Renaldo:  I’m doing well.  The reason I’m calling is t hat I was very impressed with you last week, and I’d like to offer you the job.     

Simone:  Thank you very much.  I’m delighted to hear it .  I really appreciate the job offer.   

Renaldo:  I think we now need to talk about salary.  Wh at are your salary requirements? 

Simone:  Well, for this type of position, I would be l ooking for a salary range between $60,000 and $65,000.   

 Renaldo:  Hmm, that’s a bit higher than I was thinkin g, given our budget constraints.  Perhaps we can give you an attractive compensat ion package if the salary isn’t quite what you’re looking for. 

Simone:  I’m certainly open to negotiations, though I think that the salary range I named is comparable to that of similar positions in the field.   

Renaldo:  All right.  Why don’t you consider this:  I can  give you a salary of $50,000 and I’ll increase your annual vacation time from  two weeks to three weeks. 

Simone:  Hmm, I’ll need to think about that… 

Renaldo:  In this economy, it’s a salary that many people  would jump at.   

Simone:  I understand that, but I also know that I have  a lot to offer your company.   

Renaldo:  That’s certainly true, and I don’t you to wal k away from this job if there’s any way we can close the gap in salary. 

Simone:  If you’re willing to up the offer to $60,00 0, then I think it may be doable. 

Renaldo:  Well, $60,000 is really the ceiling for that  position.  I’ll have to give it some thought and call you back. 

Simone:  Please do, and again, thank you very much for th e offer.  It would be an honor to work with you and to work at Cinetect.

Our phone conversation begins with Renaldo saying, “Hello , may I speak to Simone Otto?”  Simone says, “This is Simone.  May I ask wh o’s calling?”  That’s a somewhat formal way when someone calls you but doesn’t i dentify themselves first; you’re asking them to tell you who they are. Renal do says, “This is Renaldo Garcia at Cinetect,” the name of his company or the compa ny where he works. He says, “You interviewed for a position with me last wee k.”  So, Simone wants to get a job at Cinetect and Renaldo is calling her a fter the interview.  “To interview” means to have a meeting with that person, wh ere they ask questions and you give answers about your qualifications for the jo b. 

 Simone says, “Oh, yes, of course.  How are you?”  Renaldo  says, “I’m doing well. The reason I’m calling is that I was very impressed with you  last week, and I’d like to offer you the job (I would like to say this job is yours if you want it).” Simone says, “Thank you very much.  I’m delighted to hear it.”  This is a somewhat formal way of saying I’m very happy hear that new s; I’m very happy to find out that you are offering me, in this case, a job.   Simone says, “I really appreciate the job offer.”  The “job offer” is when t hey say either by telling you or by writing you that we are offering you a job; we are saying you can have this job if you want it. 

Renaldo says, “I think we now need to talk about salary,” the amount of money that you’re paid.  “Salary” is the amount of money that  you’re paid in a year, regardless of how many hours you work.  There are two wa ys of being paid.  One is with a salary, where you get paid a certain amount o f money even if you work 10 hours a day.  The other way of getting paid is a wa ge (wage).  A “wage” is when you are paid usually by the hour; so the more hours you work the more you’re paid.  In the United States, most professional positions (administrative positions) are by salary, not by the hour.  Hourly wages ar e usually for jobs that perhaps don’t require the same level of education as a professional job does, but that’s not always the case. 

Renaldo asks Simone, “What are your salary requirements ( what is the amount of money that you need and expect from this job)?”  Sim one says, “Well, for this type of position (for this kind of job), I would be loo king for a salary range between $60,000 and $65,000.”  “I would be looking” is just a slightly more formal way of saying I am looking for a salary range.  A “range ” is the highest and lowest amount of something.  In this case, the salary rang e is the lowest amount that she would accept to the highest amount that you coul d expect.  She, of course, would take a higher salary, we guess.  But the sala ry range would be the average salary, the salary that would be typical for a job like this.   

Renaldo says, “Hmm, that’s a bit higher than I was thinki ng,” meaning it’s more money than he thought the new employee, Simone, shoul d be paid.  He says, “given our budget constraints.”  “Given” means taking into  consideration “our budget (or financial) constraints.  A “constraint” is somet hing that limits what you can do.  Renaldo is saying here, basically, we don’t have e nough money in our budget (in the plan that we have for the money we’re going to spend) to pay the salary that you want.  He says, “Perhaps we can give you a n attractive compensation package if the salary isn’t quite what you’re looking for.”  A “compensation package” would be a combination of all th e things that you get in exchange for working at your job.  So this would include health insurance, vacation days, retirement money (money for when you stop w orking); those  

 would all be part of a compensation package.  The word “compensation” is just another word for what you received by doing something; by working there, you receive money plus all these other things. 

Simone says, “I’m certainly open to negotiations.”  “To b e open to (something)” means that you are willing to do something.  “Negotiat ions” is when you sit down with someone and you talk about a difference that you h ave, and to try to come to some common agreement.  Perhaps one person gives up som ething, you give up something; you compromise, you negotiate.  “Negotiat ions” is the noun from the verb “to negotiate.”  Simone says she’s open to negot iations, “though I think that the salary range I named is comparable to that of  similar positions in the field.”  “To be comparable” means to be similar, someth ing that you can compare, with the same characteristics.  She’s saying that t he salary range she gave Renaldo, 60 to $65,000, is similar to other jobs ( similar jobs) in that field (in that type of work, whatever it is). 

Renaldo says, “All right.  Why don’t you consider (why don’ t you think about) this: I can give you a salary of $50,000 and I’ll increase your a nnual vacation time from two weeks to three weeks.”  “To increase” means to g ive more vacation days.  “Annual” is every year.  Typically in the U.S., in jo bs you get between maybe two to four weeks of vacation every year, it depends o n the job.  Typical is two weeks, not like in other countries where you may get four or five weeks. Typically it’s less here in the U.S. than in some other co untries. 

So, Simone says, “Hmm, I’ll need to think about that.”  Renaldo says, “In this economy, it’s a salary that many people would jump at.”  “To jump at,” here, means to decide to do something immediately, without t hinking before making your decision because it’s so good, it’s so attractive.  Rena ldo is saying that with difficult economic times, this is a good salary and other p eople would take it immediately.  This, of course, is a kind of psychological pr essure that he’s trying to put on Simone, trying to force her, maybe make her f eel even a little guilty that she’s asking for a higher salary.  This is, of course, part of the negotiation process.  The word “jump” has a couple of different mean ings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.   

Simone says, “I understand that (meaning I understand it  is a good salary), but I also know that I have a lot to offer your company.”  Ren aldo says, “That’s certainly true, and I don’t you to walk away from this jo b if there’s any way we can close the gap in salary.”  “To walk away,” here, mean s to say no to something.  It doesn’t mean literally to walk in the op posite direction, although it could mean that.  But in this context, it means to say no,  to say, “No, thank you.  I don’t want this position,” and that’s the end of it.  Renaldo is trying to close the  

 gap.  “To close the gap” means to somehow compromise, ne gotiate so that we can find something we both agree on.  Maybe not 50,000 , maybe not 60,000, perhaps 55,000; where one person goes up and the other  person goes down, and they can agree on something.  A “gap” is a space in b etween two things.  In this case it’s the distance, if you will, the difference in  the amount of money that Simone wants and Renaldo is offering her. 

Simone says, “If you’re willing to up the offer to $60, 000, then I think it may be doable.”  “To up,” here, means to increase.  “Up” is u sed as a verb, to make something bigger or louder; in this case, to increase th e salary.  “If you’re willing to up the offer (meaning what you are offering me) t o $60,000, then I think,” she says, “it may be doable,” meaning I can do it.  Renaldo says, “Well, $60,000 is really the ceiling for that position.”  The “ceiling” i s the maximum or highest amount that you, in this case, will pay somebody.  “Ceili ng” has other meanings in English; the Learning Guide will give you some more  explanations about those.   

Renaldo says, “I’ll have to give it some thought and call you back,” meaning I’ll have to think about it.  “To give (something) some tho ught” means to think about it.  Simone says, “Please do, and again, thank you very mu ch for the offer.  It would be an honor to work with you and to work at Cine tect.” 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
