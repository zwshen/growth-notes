On this episode, we’re going to listen to a very de ep discussion between Rene and Francis discussing philosophy. Let’s get starte d. 

[start of dialogue] 

Rene: Why are you sitting here just staring into sp ace? 

Francis: I’m pondering life. 

Rene: That sounds profound. 

Francis: I’m examining my life from a metaphysical standpoint. I’m not sure I really exist. Maybe my entire life is an illusion a nd there’s no such thing as reality. 

Rene: Okay. Are you sure you’re feeling all right?  

Francis: I’m better now that I’ve made some decisio ns about my epistemological outlook on life. I’m allowing reason and logic to g uide me. 

Rene: That’s great, but you still seem a little dis tracted. 

Francis: That’s because I’m wrestling with some maj or questions about ethics and morality. It’s not easy always trying to do the  right thing. 

Rene: I can understand that, but could you get me .  . .  

Francis: But then I think that perhaps the only thi ng that matters in life are esthetics, and I should devote my life to creating beauty.  

 Rene: That’s a nice idea, but have you given any th ought to how you’d pay the rent? You could start by getting me a cup of coffee . 

Francis: Ah, I see you’re a realist. Do you want yo ur usual or do you want to hear the specials? 

[end of dialogue] 

Rene asks Francis, “Why are you sitting here just s taring in to space?” “To stare” (stare) means to look at something for a long time.  “To stare into space” usually means to “daydream” – to sit in a single spot and t hink about something. You are looking at something but you’re not really focusing  on anything. You are instead thinking about something else. You are thinking per haps about a problem, or you’re dreaming of something good, perhaps of somet hing bad.  

When you think of something and imagine something a nd you’re not sleeping, we call that “daydreaming.” “Staring into space” is ba sically the same as daydreaming. It’s thinking, perhaps deeply, about s omething, not paying attention to what’s going on around you. Francis says, “I’m p ondering life.” “To ponder” (ponder) means to think about something very seriou sly. We might say “to consider something deeply.”  

Rene says, “That sounds profound.” Something that i s “profound” (profound) is something with a lot of meaning or significance or importance. Another adjective we might use simply is one that I’ve already used, which is “deep.” “To be profound” is “to be deep” – to be serious, to have something very perhaps insightful in your comments or in your thinking. Fr ancis says, “I’m examining my life from a metaphysical standpoint.” A “standpoint ” (standpoint) is a perspective, a particular way of thinking about something. It mi ght also be considered a point of view or an outlook.  

“Metaphysical” (metaphysical) refers to the efforts  to understand the nature of the world, to understand the larger meaning of our exis tence. “Metaphysics” is considered a “branch” (branch) or type of philosoph y. It usually deals with subjects such as being and knowing and existence – “fundamental concepts,” you might say, in philosophy. Aristotle is most fam ous for his metaphysics. A “metaphysical standpoint,” then, if it means anythi ng, I guess would be contemplating or thinking about your existence and your being.  

Francis says, “I’m not really sure I really exist.”  “To exist” means to be real, to be actual, not to be imaginary. He says, “Maybe my ent ire life is an illusion and  

there’s no such thing as reality.” An “illusion” (i llusion) is something that you see but isn’t real. It doesn’t actually exist. “Reality ” (reality) is that which really does exist – things that are not imaginary or not fake.  

I don’t want to get into long philosophical discuss ions with you about reality and existence. I’m giving you the general meanings of t hese terms as they might be used in normal conversation, less than perhaps in a  philosophical discussion, even though this dialogue is entitled “Discussing P hilosophy.” Rene says, “Okay. Are you sure you’re feeling all right?” She’s askin g if perhaps Francis is feeling sick or ill.  

Francis says, “I’m better now that I’ve made some d ecisions about my epistemological outlook on life.” “Epistemological”  comes from the term “epistemology” (epistemology). “Epistemology” is an other one of those areas of study in philosophy. “Epistemology” has to do with the study of knowledge and how we know things, or how we get to know things. H ow is it that we know what is true? How is it that we know what we know? Those  are questions that epistemology might try to answer. “Epistemological outlook,” then, would be the way that you view how knowledge is acquired, I gues s.  

Francis says, “I’m allowing reason and logic to gui de me.” “Reason” (reason) refers to the mind’s ability to think, to understan d, to form conclusions. “Logic” (logic), in general conversation, usually refers to  a clear, organized way of thinking about something. Logic is another one of t hose areas of philosophy. In some ways, logic is the set of tools that philosoph ers use to understand things. Logic refers to how arguments are constructed, how you put together an argument in order to reach a conclusion.  

Francis says he’s going to allow reason and logic t o guide him, which seems fair enough, reasonable enough. Rene says, “That’s great , but you still seem a little distracted.” Someone who is “distracted” (distracte d) is unable to focus on something, often because he is thinking about somet hing else instead of what perhaps he should be thinking about. Francis respon ds that he’s distracted because he’s “wrestling with some major questions a bout ethics and morality.”  

The phrasal verb “to wrestle (wrestle) with” someth ing means to debate or to think very seriously about a problem, a problem tha t you’re finding difficult perhaps to solve or to come to a conclusion about. “I’m wrestling with the choice I have to make about what I’m going to eat for dinner .” I’m not sure. I’m going back and forth. I’m debating. Should I have chicken? Sho uld I have vegetables? I’m wrestling with my decision. Well, not really. I’m g oing to have chicken and vegetables. But that’s the meaning of the phrasal v erb “to wrestle with.”   

 Francis is “wrestling with some major,” or importan t, “questions.” These are questions about “ethics” (ethics) and “morality” (m orality). These two terms are often used in a similar way in conversational Engli sh. I’m no philosopher. I’m not going to try to give you exact definitions. “Morali ty,” however, I would generally tend to use to describe certain principles of what is right and what is wrong. Sometimes those principles, or laws, or rules, or s tandards are taken from a religious point of view, sometimes not.  

“Ethics” relates to the application of those moral principles to perhaps specific situations, determining whether you should do somet hing or not do something. However, having said that, ethics could also refer to those same moral principles that people use to determine whether something is r ight or wrong, just or unjust.  

In modern American English, my guess is that many p eople would associate morality with a religious point of view and ethics with, not necessarily an areligious point of view, but one that may not be b ased on a religious belief system. But that’s a very general way of defining i t that not everyone may agree with. This is philosophy, after all. People disagre e about things like this.  

Francis says, “It’s not always easy trying to do th e right thing.” Rene says, “I can understand that but could you get me . . .” And the n Francis interrupts her and continues, “But then I think that perhaps the only thing that matters in life,” that’s important in life, “are esthetics and I should devo te my life to creating beauty.” Francis says perhaps the only thing important in li fe, that matters in life, are “esthetics” (esthetics). “Esthetics” refers to the study of beauty, of appreciating beauty in other things and in other people. Francis  thinks he should devote his life to creating beauty.  

Rene says, “That’s a nice idea, but have you given any thought” – that is, have you thought about – “Have you given any thought to how you’d pay the rent?” meaning if you spend your life creating beauty, wil l you make enough money to afford to pay your rent? Rene says, “You could star t by getting me a cup of coffee.” Now we realize that Francis is actually wo rking at a coffee shop, maybe Starbucks, and Rene is one of his customers who wan ts a cup of coffee.  

Francis says, “Ah, I see you’re a realist.” And the n he asks, “Do you want your usual or do you want to hear the specials?” A “real ist” (realist) is a person who, I suppose in this case, accepts things as they are, o ne who uses logic to understand the way the world works. Francis then as ks Rene if she wants her “usual,” meaning the coffee drink she usually gets,  or if she wants to hear the “specials” – the special drinks that the coffee sho p is offering today.   

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a no rmal speed.
