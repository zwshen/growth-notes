On this episode, we’re going to listen to a dialogu e between Giancarlo and Alana about someone who works out on the street performin g in order to get money. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Giancarlo: Whoa, where are you going? I thought we were going to hang out.

Alana: I’m going to work.

Giancarlo: Work? I didn’t know you got a job.

Alana: I’m busking on Main Street.

Giancarlo: You mean you’re panhandling? That’s not working.

Alana: I’m not panhandling. I’m working for tips. I  perform, try to draw a crowd, and then pass the hat.

Giancarlo: Can you really make money that way?

Alana: You’d be surprised. I got the idea from Dani elle and her friends. A group of them do street theater and comedy routines. A fr iend of theirs juggles and does acrobatics. Another guy does magic tricks.

Giancarlo: And they do all this on the street? Don’ t they get hassled by the cops?

Alana: The cops occasionally tell them to move alon g or tell the crowd to disperse, but if they’re respectful and nobody comp lains, they get left alone. Hey wait, where are you going?

Giancarlo: I’m going with you. I want to give this street performing a try.

Alana: What can you do?

Giancarlo: I’m a man of many talents.

Alana: Are you?

Giancarlo: Don’t look so surprised!

Giancarlo begins our dialogue by using a common wor d in informal English, “Whoa.” “Whoa,” usually spelled (whoa), is a way of  stopping someone or of expressing surprise about something. It’s an old ex pression that we usually associate with someone riding on a horse and wantin g to stop the horse. Someone might say, “Whoa.” Well, nowadays we use it  not to stop horses, but sometimes to stop people from saying something or g oing somewhere. That’s what Giancarlo is doing.

He says, “Whoa, where are you going? I thought we w ere going to hang out.” “To hang (hang) out” is a two-word phrasal verb that me ans to spend time with another person, usually in a lazy sort of way. You may go over to your friend’s house and, I don’t know, have a glass of wine, or a  beer, or a cup of tea, and just relax and talk. You’re going to hang out. “To hang out” usually implies that you’re not going to do anything in particular, anything sp ecial. You’re just going to sort of talk and spend time enjoying yourselves without any specific plans to do anything.

Alana says, however, “I’m going to work.” Giancarlo  says, “Work? I didn’t know you got a job.” Alana says, “I’m busking on Main St reet.” “To busk” (busk) means to play music on a sidewalk or in another public pl ace in the hopes that people will give you money for playing music. We’ve all se en people busking on a city street before or in a subway area or perhaps in a p ark. People play guitars or other musical instruments. Sometimes they sing in the hopes that people will give them money.

Giancarlo says, “You mean you’re panhandling? That’ s not working.” “To panhandle” (panhandle) means to ask people for mone y, especially if you are sitting on a sidewalk or standing on the side of a road. Another verb meaning the same thing is “to beg” (beg). “To panhandle,” howev er, means specifically to beg in the street or in a public area.

Now, normally we don’t consider people who are busk ing, who are actually doing something like playing music, to be panhandling. “T o panhandle” usually means you’re just asking someone for money. You’re not do ing anything to get the person to give you money – other than, I suppose, a sking in a nice way. You can see panhandlers in Los Angeles very easily by simpl y driving to any of the poorer areas of the city.

Alana says, “I’m not panhandling. I’m working for t ips.” A “tip” (tip) is money that you normally give someone to thank him or her for g ood service or for a job well done. Normally in the United States we tip at a res taurant. We tip the server – the waitress or the waiter. We also tip at the hotel if  someone takes our bags in. We may tip a taxi driver. Americans like to tip a lot more than people in other countries, and in fact, when Americans go to anothe r country, people are sometimes surprised to see them tipping at places that the people who live in those countries don’t normally tip.

Alana says she’s just “working for tips,” meaning s he’s just working for people giving her money because she’s doing a good job. “I  perform,” she says, “try to draw a crowd, and then pass the hat.” “To draw (dra w) a crowd (crowd)” means to attract many people to hear or to see something,  to do something that people will want to come and hear or see. It could be a go od thing. It could be a bad thing. Normally, “to draw a crowd” means to get peo ple to pay attention to you because, perhaps, you’re performing.

“To pass the hat” means to take a hat, the kind of thing you wear on your head, and turn it over and ask people to put money in it.  It’s a common way that street performers try to get people to give them money. Th ey perform and then they take perhaps a hat, or sometimes it’s just a small bowl, and they give it to people and ask them to put money in it. Giancarlo says, “C an you really make money that way?” Alana says, “You’d be surprised,” meanin g “Yes, even though you may not think so.”

She says, “I got the idea from Danielle and her fri ends. A group of them do street theater and comedy routines.” “Street theatre” is, just as it sounds, a group of people who perform small parts of a play or small d ramatic performances on a public street – once again, in the hopes usually of  getting tips, of getting people

to give them money. A “comedy routine” (routine) is  when someone stands up and tells jokes or does something funny to get peop le to laugh. Comedy routines usually involve one person telling jokes and making  people laugh.

Alana continues, “A friend of theirs juggles and do es acrobatics. Another guy does magic tricks.” Alana is mentioning other popul ar forms of street performance – the things that street performers do.  One of them is “to juggle” (juggle). “To juggle” here means to keep several ba lls or other small items in the air by throwing them up into the air and, of course , catching them with your hands and then throwing them up in the air again.

In everyday English, we sometimes use the verb “to juggle” to mean to move things around, especially on your calendar, on your  schedule. Someone may say, “I need to juggle my calendar in order to find  time to meet with you.” I need to rearrange things. I need to move appointments on  my calendar, on my schedule. But the other meaning of the verb “to jug gle” – the, I guess you could say, “original meaning” – is to throw balls up into  the air. I have a nephew who is a very good juggler. Unfortunately, it’s hard to ma ke money juggling. I think he works at a grocery store now.

“To do acrobatics” (acrobatics) means to move your body in unusual ways, often using ropes and swings that are suspended in the ai r. Now, I’m not sure how you would do acrobatics as a street performer. Normally , we associate acrobatics with something like a circus. A “circus” (circus) is a performance for a large group of people that usually includes tricks with animals  and doing things such as acrobatics where someone walks on a wire that is hi gh up in the air. “Magic tricks” refer to any action that is surprising and entertaining. People often do magic tricks with cards, for example, or they appea r to make things disappear suddenly.

Giancarlo then asks, “And they do all of this on the street? Don’t they get hassled by the cops?” “To get hassled” (hassled) is to get bothered by. The verb “to hassle” means to create problems or trouble for som eone. The “cops” (cops) refers to the police. “Cop” is an informal term for  a police officer – a policeman or a policewoman. Giancarlo wants to know if the stree t performers get “hassled” or bothered by the police.

Alana says, “The cops occasionally tell them to mov e along or tell the crowd to disperse.” “To move along” means to keep walking, to continue moving in a particular direction. “To disperse” (disperse) mean s to separate and to go in different directions. If a police officer disperses  a crowd, the officer is getting

people to no longer stand together, but to each go in a different direction so that there’s no longer a group of people in a single pla ce.

Alana says, however, if the street performers are “ respectful and nobody complains, they get left alone.” “To be left alone”  means not to be bothered by other people, to be allowed to do what you want to do. Alana then says, “Hey wait, where are you going?” Giancarlo says, “I’m go ing with you. I want to give this street performing a try.” Alana says, “What ca n you do?” Giancarlo says, “I’m a man of many talents.”

The expression “I’m a man of many talents” (talents ) would describe a person who is good at doing many different things. Giancar lo thinks that he has some talent, some ability that he can use to be a street  performer. Alana is surprised. She’s asks, “Are you?” meaning are you really a per son of many talents? Giancarlo says, “Don’t look so surprised,” meaning she shouldn’t be surprised that he has all of these different talents. Of cour se he does. Giancarlo think he’s very talented, apparently.

I have to say I’ve never worked as a street perform er, although you can see street performers here in Los Angeles, even though Los Angeles is famous for people not walking on the streets. They take their cars, of course. Maybe I could try to teach English on the streets of Los Angeles and people will give me tips for that. I should try it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
