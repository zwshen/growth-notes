Marco: Hello. 

Claudia: Hey, Marco? It's Claudia. Got a minute?  

Marco: Sure. What's up?  

Claudia: I'm just wondering what's going on with yo u and Beth. Are you guys still going out? 

Marco: We went out for a while, but we never got se rious. Why all the questions? Are you interested in Beth?  

Claudia: (Laughs) No, I'm not interested but Shane is. He's been asking me about you guys. He wants to ask her out but he didn 't know whether you guys were still together, or how you’d feel about him as king out your ex.  

Marco: Why didn't he just ask me? Beth and I were c asual and we haven't seen each other in months. He should go for it.  

Claudia: Okay, I'll tell him. So, if you're not goi ng out with Beth, who's the new girl?  

Marco: Wouldn't you like to know. Actually, I've be en seeing a great girl. I'm bringing her to the party on Saturday. You'll meet her then. 

Claudia: Great. I'm bringing Lenny so you'll get to  meet him, too. See you Saturday. 

Marco: See ya!

In this podcast, we meet Claudia and Marco. Claudia  calls Marco on the telephone and Marco answers, “Hello.” And Claudia s ays, “Hey, Marco. It’s Claudia. Got a minute?” “Hey,” (hey) you probably k now is an informal way of saying hello to someone. “Hey, Marco, got a minute? ” means do you have a minute to talk to me. So, if someone says to you, “ Hey, you got a minute?” what they mean is I want to talk to you. Do you have tim e to talk to me right now? Marco says, “Sure. What’s up?” And, of course, “Wha t’s up” again, informal, to mean what’s going on, what is happening, what do yo u want to talk to me about. And Claudia says, “I’m just wondering what’s going on with you and Beth. Are you guys still going out?” The expression “What’s g oing on” here means what is the situation, what is happening between you two. A nd this is sometimes used when there’s a problem. For example, a parent, a fa ther or a mother may see their child crying, and they’ll ask him what’s goin g on or when they see two children fighting, “What’s going on here?” – means what is the problem, why is this happening?  

But in this dialog, it’s really just what is the si tuation, what is the – in this case, romantic relationship or no romantic relationship b etween you and Beth. “Are you guys still going out?” “To go out” means here to be  dating, to be romantically interested and involved with someone. Notice the us e of the term “guys” (guys) which again, informal to mean you people. In Englis h, the use of the plural “you” is not very common, at least in American English. S o, when we say “you,” we could mean just one person or we could mean three o r four people. In some dialects, in some variations of American English, w e say, “You all” – that’s a very southern United States expression – “You all.” But most people don’t say that, most people would just say, “you” or informally the y might say, “You guys,” meaning the two of you, in this case, or more.  

Well, Marco says that “We went out for a while” – a gain, we dated for a while – “but never got serious.” And “to get serious” if yo u are dating someone, in a relationship – a boyfriend, girlfriend – “to get se rious” means you are thinking about getting married or you are thinking about sta ying together for a long time. Marco then says, “Why all the questions? Are you in terested in Beth?” “Why all the questions” here means why are you asking me the se questions. You want to  

know why this person is interested and he makes a j oke by saying, “Are you interested in Beth?”  

Well, Claudia is not interested in Beth but she say s that her friend, Shane, is. “Shane has been asking Claudia about you guys” – ag ain, about Marco and Beth. “He wants to ask her out but he didn’t know w hether you guys were still together.” “To ask someone out” means that you are going to ask someone to go on a date with you. So, you ask someone out “on a d ate” – is what we would say – “to ask out,” or “to ask out on a date” and if yo u are interested in each other, then you may start to go out together, meaning you are now dating each other, you are romantically interested in each other. Well , Shane wasn’t sure if Marco and Beth were “still together,” meaning they were s till romantically involved, they were still boyfriend and girlfriend. 

Shane was also uncertain about how Marco would feel  about asking out his ex. And again, “ex” (ex) is short for ex-girlfriend, in  this case. It can also mean, when someone says, “your ex” it can also mean your ex-hu sband or your ex-wife – if you divorce from that person. Marco says, “Why didn ’t he just ask me?” In other words, why didn’t Shane ask me directly. “Beth and I,” Marco says, “were casual, and we haven’t seen each other for months.” “To be casual” in this context, means that they weren’t serious, that they weren’t interested in getting married, they were just dating each other. “Casual,” normall y means relaxed, not serious. We also use that expression to talk about clothing.  If somebody says, “Dress is casual for the party,” that means that you don’t ha ve to wear a suit and a tie or very nice clothing. You can dress, you can come in jeans and maybe tennis shoes – that would be dressing casually. Well, Marc o says that Shane should just “go for it.” “To go for it” here means he shou ld do it. There’s a famous advertising line in the U.S. and in other English s peaking countries for Nike – the company Nike that makes tennis shoes, running shoes , and it’s called “Just do it.” And it’s very similar to “go for it,” meaning that you should go ahead, make a decision and, in this case, ask Beth out.  

Well, Claudia says that she will tell Shane and the n asks Marco, “Who’s the new girl?” “Who’s the new girl?” meaning who is your new girlf riend. Marco says somewhat again, as a joke, “Wouldn’t you like to know.” That  expression “Wouldn’t you like to know” is when someone asks you a question and wa nts to get information from you, but you don’t think it is any of their co ncern. It’s, we would say, “It’s none of their business,” meaning they don’t need to  know. And usually, it’s when someone is asking you something private or personal , or secret. So, instead of telling the person the answer, you say, “Wouldn’t y ou like to know,” meaning I’m  

not going to tell you, it’s none of your business, it’s not your concern. You shouldn’t be interested in it.  

But Marco then shows that he is joking when he says , “Actually, I’ve been seeing a great girl.” “To be seeing” means that I am datin g. So, if someone asks you, “Are you seeing anyone?” And it’s the verb “see” (s eeing) – “Are you seeing anyone?” – they mean are you romantically involved,  are you dating anyone. Do you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend? And he says –  Marco says he’s been seeing a great girl and that he’s going to bring her to th e party. Claudia says, “Great! I’m bringing Lenny, (her boyfriend) and you’ll get to m eet him, too.”  

Notice there seems to be some – we would say – some  romantic or sexual tension between these two, Marco and Claudia. They’ re talking on the telephone, but when we say there seems to be some romantic or sexual “tension” (tension) we mean that they seem to like each other, even tho ugh they each have their own boyfriend or girlfriend, they seem to be intere sted in each other. Well, that’s my interpretation of the dialog. Well, the dialog e nds with Marco saying, “See ya!” And the expression “See ya!” – and here, instead of  saying “You,” we say, “Ya” (ya). It’s just a short, informal way of saying, “Y ou.” So, if somebody says, “See you,” or “See you later” – means I hope that we wil l see each other later. 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a nat ive rate of speech.
