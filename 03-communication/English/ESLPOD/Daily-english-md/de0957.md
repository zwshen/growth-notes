This dialogue on this episode is between Mia and Al ex about using drugs to perform better when playing sports. Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Mia: This is ridiculous! They’re going to suspend E ric Rodrigo for doping.

Alex: From what I’ve read, he failed his random dru g test and they found performance-enhancing drugs in his system.

Mia: But he’s one of the best players on the team. Without him, we won’t have a chance to get to the playoffs.

Alex: He should have thought of that before he deci ded to cheat. I’m surprised they’re only suspending him for a few games. Last y ear, a player on another team was banned for life from the sport and strippe d of his championship titles.

Mia: In my opinion, they completely overreacted and  one of the best players in the game is off the field forever.

Alex: You don’t think that people who use steroids and other banned substances should be punished?

Mia: Not when the fans are the ones who really pay the price.

Alex: So you’re in favor of allowing performance-en hancing drugs in sports?

Mia: Sure, why not? If everybody is doping, it leve ls the playing field.

Alex: I am really glad you’re not the commissioner!

Our dialogue begins by Mia saying, “This is ridicul ous. They're going to suspend Eric Rodrigo for doping.” When someone says, “This is ridiculous,” they mean this is wrong, this is crazy. Something is happenin g that doesn't make any sense.

Mia says, “They're going to suspend Eric Rodrigo for doping.” “To suspend” (suspend) means to temporarily not allow someone to  do something. If a student does something wrong at school – say, gets into a f ight with another student – he might be suspended. The school may say, “You can't come to class for the next week. You're suspended. You have to stay home or go  out and fight somebody on the street.” No, they don't want them to fight s omeone on the street. They just want the student to be punished. So, when you “susp end” someone from something, you're usually punishing them for doing something wrong.

This person, Eric, is being suspended for, or becau se of, “doping” (doping). “Doping” is the practice of using illegal drugs to improve your athletic performance. The drugs actually aren't always illeg al. They’re just not allowed in certain competitions. This, of course, has been a p roblem in the last 25, 30 years in the Olympics and, more prominently, in the Tour de France. Alex says, “From what I've read, he” – meaning Eric – “failed his ra ndom drug test and they found performance enhancing drugs in his system.” A “drug  test” is when you are tested to see whether you have taken any drugs. The y could do this by taking some of your blood. That's a very common type of dr ug test.

A “random drug test” is when you don't know when th ey're going to test you. They often test athletes randomly so that the athle te can't prepare; the athlete can't stop taking the drug for a few days so that the drug test doesn't find anything in their system. Alex says that Eric's ran dom drug test found that he was taking “performance-enhancing drugs,” sometimes ref erred to by their abbreviation “PEDs.” “Performance-enhancing drugs” are drugs that make you perform better – specifically, help an athlete perf orm better, make him or her stronger or faster.

When we talk about drug tests and trying to detect,  or see, whether someone is using a certain kind of drug, we often use the term  “system,” as in: “They found drugs in his system.” “System” (system) here just m eans in some part of your body. We talk about the “digestive system.” That's the parts of your body that allow you to eat food and get energy from that food . You have the “respiratory system.” The “respiratory system” consists of the p arts of your body that allow you to breathe – your lungs, for example. When we s ay that they found PEDs in

his system, we mean they found drugs in the blood s ample that they took from him.

Mia says that Eric is “one of the best players on the team.” “Without him, we won't have a chance” – we won't get the opportunity  – “to get to the playoffs.” In most sports, especially professional sports, at the  end of the season – at the end of the period of time when the teams play – there is usually a competition that involves “playoffs.” The best teams from that year play each other to determine who is the very best. So, in American football you have playoffs that lead to the Super Bowl, where the two best teams play each othe r. In American baseball, we have the playoffs that lead to the World Series. In  international soccer, you have the World Cup. Those all involve playoffs – teams p laying each other to determine which team is the best.

Alex says that Eric “should have thought of that be fore he decided to cheat.” Alex is saying that Eric should have thought of the cons equences of his actions when he took these performance-enhancing drugs. Alex say s that he has cheated. “To cheat” (cheat) means to be dishonest in the way tha t you are playing or in the way that you are competing. You can also cheat in s chool. You can look at someone else's answers on a test. That would be als o be considered cheating. It would also be considered stupid, if the person next  to you doesn't know any more than you do.

Alex says, “I’m surprised they’re only suspending h im for a few games. Last year, a player on another team was banned for life from the sport and stripped of his championship titles.” “To be banned (banned) for li fe” means you are not allowed to do something ever again. This is something that happens, for example, if an athlete does something really bad, really wrong. He  or she might be banned for life from competing professionally in that sport. T his doesn't happen very often. It does happen sometimes.

There was a very famous baseball player who was ban ned for life even though he was one of the best baseball players of the twen tieth century, a man by the name of Pete Rose. We won't go into his story. It is possible to be banned for life, and that's what happened in our dialogue to another  player – not to Eric, to someone else. This person also was “stripped of his  championship titles.” “To strip” (strip) means to take something off. Typical ly, we use this verb in talking about your clothing. To take your clothing off – al l of your clothing off – would be to strip. There are, of course, some people who do that professionally, but we’re not going to talk about that here.

In our dialogue, the verb “to strip” means to take away some honor or some prize or some award from someone because they've done som ething wrong. Our athlete who was banned for life was “stripped of his championship titles.” The term “titles” here refers to honors or awards that people win. “Championship titles” would be awards that you won for being the best team, for winning a competition that determined who the best team was o r the best player was. In the Olympics, we give people who win a medal – either a  gold, silver, or bronze medal. If they later find that that person cheated,  they can strip that person of his or her medals. The medals represent the title, if y ou will – the award or honor.

Mia says, “In my opinion, they completely overreact ed and one of the best players in the game is off the field forever.” “To react (react) to” something is to respond to something – to do something because some thing else has been done. “To overreact” means to react too strongly to  something. If someone criticizes you by saying that your shirt is a littl e dirty, and you decide to take out a gun and shoot that person, that would be overreacti ng. You're reacting much too strongly given the situation. You shouldn't kill pe ople who criticize you if you have a dirty shirt or whatever. You shouldn't kill anyon e anyway, but definitely not for a criticism of your shirt.

Mia says the sporting organization – of whatever sp ort this is – overreacted by suspending Eric Rodrigo, and now “one of the best p layers in the game is off the field forever.” The “field” is the area, the ground , where they play on. You can have a football field. You can have a soccer field.  You can have a baseball field. Alex says, “You don't think that people who use ste roids and other banned substances should be punished?” “Steroids” (steroid s) are drugs that are often made and given to athletes to make them stronger. I  take steroids, for example, to do my podcasts. I need that extra strength. I'm kidding, of course. “Banned substances” are drugs or other things that you put into your body that are not allowed. “To ban” something means to prohibit it.

Mia says, “Not when the fans are the ones who reall y pay the price.” Mia is not in favor of punishing athletes because “the fans” – the people who watch the sport – “are the ones who really pay the price.” “To pay the price” here doesn’t refer to money, but rather any other sort of negative conseq uence or bad result that comes from some action. If you want to run a marath on – if you want to run 26 miles – you have to pay the price. The price may be  physical pain. It may be having to work extra hard. It may mean having to ge t up early in the morning to go out and practice your running. That would be pay ing the price.

Alex says, “So you're in favor of allowing performa nce-enhancing drugs in sports?” Mia says, “Sure, why not? If everybody is doping, it levels the playing

field.” Mia is saying that if everyone is taking dr ugs, then no one has an advantage. When no one has any advantage, we say the playing field is “level” (level). “Level” can also be a verb, “to level,” wh ich means to make something even, so that one part is not higher than the other . In this case, one person is not better than the other. “To level the playing field, ” then, means to make everything fair by not giving any person an advantage over the  other.

Alex said, “I am really glad you're not the commiss ioner.” The “commissioner” (commissioner) is a person whose job it is to lead,  or be in charge of, some typically government department, although it is als o used in the United States for large sporting organizations. There is a commission er, or a president, of Major League Baseball. There's a commissioner, or leader,  of the National Football League. That's what Alex is referring to here. He's  saying that he's glad that Mia is not in charge of – is not the commissioner of – whatever sporting organization they are a member of. We never learned what sport M ia and Alex are talking about here.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

She doesn't need any performance-enhancing drugs to  write her scripts. I refer, of course, to our wonderful scriptwriter, Dr. Lucy Tse. Thank you, Lucy.
