[start of dialogue]

Steve:  I’m finally home and I’m hungry.  What’s for di nner?

Brandy:  I’m making a new dish.  I think you’re really g oing to like it.

Steve:  Oh, good.  Bring it on.

Brandy:  Well, I miscalculated the cooking time a little  and it’s going to take longer than I originally planned.  I know you’re famish ed.  Here’s a snack for you to munch on while you wait.

Steve:  I’m half-starved.  I skipped lunch and had to w ork late.

Brandy:  I know, but I also know you’re dying for somethin g really good.  I promise that it’ll be worth the wait.

Steve:  Okay, but I could eat a horse right now.  Bring me something else to snack on.

 Brandy:  Don’t be too greedy and eat too much.  I don ’t want you to spoil your appetite.  I know that what I’m cooking is something you’ ve been craving for a long time, and you want to save your appetite for it.

Steve:  All right.  I’ll wait.  How much longer will it be?

Brandy:  Oh, maybe another hour or a little longer…

Steve:  Another hour?!  I’ll be dead and buried by th en!

[end of dialogue]

Steve begins by saying, “I’m finally home and I’m hungry (I want to eat).  What’s for dinner?”  Brandy says, “I’m making a new dish.  I th ink you’re really going to like it.”  “Dish” here means a type of food, food that is part of what you are eating for your dinner or lunch or any meal.  “Dish” has a coupl e of meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional  explanations.

Steve says, “Oh, good.  Bring it on.”  This phrase, “brin g it on,” is used to show that you are very interested in something, you’re very anxi ous, excited about something happening; you want it to happen right away.   Sometimes it’s used in a competition, when somebody says, “I’m going to beat you  at basketball,” and you say, “Bring it on,” meaning okay, I accept your challen ge.  I think I can beat you, that’s the general idea.

Brandy says, “Well, I miscalculated the cooking time a littl e and it’s going to take longer than I originally planned.”  “To miscalculate” i s the opposite of “to calculate” in some way; it means to make a mistake in your calculations – to make a mistake in your math, in adding or subtracting.  O r in this case, really, in estimating the amount of time it will take for the f ood to cook.  So miscalculate, not actually the opposite, but really means to calculate p oorly, to do a bad job at calculating.

Brandy did a bad job of calculating the “cooking time,” the amount of time needed for the food to cook, so it’s going to take longer than she had planned.  She says, “I know you’re famished.”  “To be famished” means to be extremely hungry, to be very, very hungry.  We sometimes use this word to talk abou t a situation where a country or an area doesn’t have enough food for the peo ple to survive; we would call that a “famine” (famine).  “To be famished,” alt hough it appears to be a related word, usually just means in normal conversation to be extremely hungry, to be very, very, very hungry.

 Brandy says that she knows Steve is famished.  She says, “Here’s a snack for you to munch on while you wait.”  A “snack” (snack) is a sm all amount of food that you eat in between your meals.  Usually it’s somethin g sweet – something good to eat.  In this case, Brandy gives Steve a snack to mu nch on.  “To munch (munch) on (something)” means to eat food, sometimes ve ry noisily – very loudly, and typically it’s used when we are talking abou t snacks.  So you invite some friends over to watch a movie at your house, and you get some popcorn and maybe some pretzels, other kinds of snacks, and people watch the movie while munching on the snacks.  You’re eating the snacks slowl y, but it’s not a formal meal.

Steve says, “I’m half-starved.”  This is the same as famished;  I am extremely hungry.  He says, “I skipped lunch and had to work late.”  “To skip” (skip) means not to do something you would normally do.  “I’m going  to skip my exercise this morning because I got up late.”  I normally exercise in the morning, but because I was late I’m going to skip it today.  “Skip” has several me anings in English, all of which – well, some of which can be found in the Learning Guide.

Brandy says, “I know (I know that you are half-starved), but  I also know you’re dying for something really good.”  When somebody says, “I ’m dying (dying) for (something)” they mean they want something, they desire so mething a lot, with a very strong emotion.  “I’m dying for some pizza.”  I rea lly want pizza.  So, you want something very badly.  You could be dying for a new  car or dying for a new dress.

Steve is dying for something really good to eat.  Brandy says, “I promise that (the meal; the food) will be worth the wait.”  When someo ne says something is “worth the wait” (wait) they mean it’s so good that it is somet hing you’ll want to wait perhaps a long time for.  You don’t really want to wa it, but it’s so good that you will wait and you will be happy when you are able, in this case, to eat the food. But many things could be worth the wait: a movie, a bo ok that you have been waiting for to be published, and so forth.

Steve says, “Okay, but I could eat a horse right now.”  Th is is an informal expression, “I could eat a horse,” to show that you are v ery hungry and could eat a lot of food.  A “horse,” of course, is an animal that  you ride on; it’s a large animal, I think that’s the idea.  Most people don’t ea t horses actually here in the United States.  I’ve never had horsemeat.  I hear it ta stes like chicken!

 Brandy says, “Don’t be too greedy and eat too much.”  Ste ve has asked to have something else to snack on – to eat as a snack, but Brandy says, “Don’t be too greedy” (greedy).  “To be greedy” means to want too much  of something, to want more than what you actually need.  That’s to be greedy.   Brandy says, “I don’t want you to spoil your appetite.”  “To spoil (spoil) yo ur appetite” means to eat a lot of things before the main meal so that when the m ain meal comes you’re not hungry anymore.  If you have some snacks and some fruit, an d you eat some things at, say, three o’clock in the afternoon, well whe n you go to dinner at six or seven o’clock you may not be hungry – you’ve spoiled your appet ite.  “Appetite” is the desire to eat food.  “To spoil” means to ruin, t o make something go bad.

Brandy says, “I know that what I’m cooking is something you’ ve been craving for for a long time.”  “To crave” (crave) means to want somet hing very much, to want something very badly, especially food.  We talked about “I ’m dying for (something),” “to crave” means the same thing but is usu ally used when talking about food: “I crave a piece of pumpkin pie.”  Brandy says,  “you’ll want to save your appetite for” what she’s cooking.  “To save your appe tite” means you’re not going to eat something now so that later you have what we would call a big appetite; you have a strong desire to want to eat a lot  of food later.  It’s in some ways the opposite of spoiling your appetite.  You’re savi ng your appetite; you’re not eating so that you will be hungrier in the future .

Steve says, “All right.  I’ll wait.  How much longer wil l it be?”  How much longer will it take until the food is ready?  Brandy says, “Oh, maybe another hour or a little longer.”  Steve says, “Another hour?!”  He’s not very happy.  He says, “I’ll be dead and buried by then!”  This expression, “to be dead and buried,” is used to emphasize that something will take too long, so long t hat I will have died by the time it is completed.  Of course, Steve won’t actually be dead and buried; it’s just an informal way of saying a very long time.  “To bury” h ere means to put the body in the ground.  Of course, Steve should be thankful that  he has such a good wife that will spend all that time and make sure that he h as a good dinner.  Instead of complaining, he should be thanking her.  Am I right la dies, huh?  Thank you!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
