<p>Student Peter was playing billiard all the term and for that reason he missed
all his lectures. Unfortunately that's the time for term exams which Peter must
pass.</p>

<p>Peter has N (1 &#60= N &#60= 10) courses, because he completely failed the
previous term exams so he has to pass them too. He is already late with his
exams and the deadline is coming. He agreed with all teachers to pass all the
exams in one day. The idea he followed is - "Everything or nothing". After he
made some considerations and an assumption that we'll play billiard only 5 hours
a day, he counted the number of hours he has left to get himself prepared for
exams. He has concluded that he has M (0 &#60 M &#60= 100) hours to get prepared.
While he is preparing he has to read at least the name of the subject he is
preparing for. Because of this difficult task he's preparing for at least one
hour for each exam. If he has no time to prepare for exam - he fails it.</p>

<p>Exam is evaluated using 10-grade system. To pass an exam Peter has to receive
at least 5. Also Peter is a greedy person and he wants to have the highest
average mark that is possible. </p>

<p>As Peter is perfectly aware of his abilities he made a table L. Each line of this
table represents a course and each column represents a number of hours Peter is
preparing for a particular exam. Element Lij of the table means, that for i-th
exam Peter devotes j-th hours of his available time. It is known that the more
Peter is getting prepared for a particular exam the highest mark he receives,
i.e. L<sub>i j</sub> = L<sub>i j+1</sub> for each 1 &#60= i &#60= N ir 1 &#60= j &#60= M - 1.</p>

<p>Suddenly Peter remembers that he has a good friend. You're actually the person
he remembered. So as he is completely desperate he asks for your help! Help Peter
in his mission of passing exams and achieving the maximum possible average mark.</p>
	
<p><h4>INPUT:</h4>
The number of tests T (T &#60 100) is given on the first line of input. First line
of each test contains two integers N and M. Then N lines follow each containing
M integers which define L<sub>i j</sub> element.</p>
    
<p><h4>OUTPUT:</h4>
For each test case find whether Peter passes all exams. If he is that lucky to
pass them print line: "<code>Maximal possible average mark - S.</code>" (The result must be rounded to 2 digits after decimal point).

<p>In case when he is
not that lucky, and he has at least one exam that he`s unable to pass in given
time limits print a line "<code>Peter, you shouldn`t have played billiard that much.</code>".</p>
