This episode is called “Workplace Safety.”  It’s a dialogu e between Lon and Abigail.  They’re going to be using vocabulary related t o accidents at work (where you have your job).  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lon:  What’s this?

Abigail:  It’s a memo about a safety inspection scheduled  for next week.

Lon:  A safety inspection?  How are we ever going to pa ss a safety inspection?

Abigail:  What do you mean?  This isn’t an unsafe workpl ace.  We’ve had a good record.  None of our employees have had on-the-job inju ries this year and we’ve never had a fatality.  I don’t understand why you’re so worried.

Lon:  From what I’ve heard, the inspectors don’t just lo ok at injury rates.  They look for the smallest hazard that may be remotely dangero us.  If we get cited, we may be shut down.

Abigail:  With all due respect, I don’t think that’s ho w it works.  Yes, the inspector will look at our work environment and our gear and mac hinery to make sure there are no hazards or toxic substances.

Lon:  That’s what I’m worried about.

 Abigail:  But, if they find a violation, we’ll get a chance to fix the problem.  They won’t shut us down without giving us a chance to comply wi th their safety standards.

Lon:  I sure hope you’re right.

Abigail:  Me, too.  We’ll know after next week’s inspect ion.

Here in the United States the state and federal gover nment have a lot of laws to protect workers to prevent them from having injuries (to prevent them from hurting themselves) while they are working.  The federa l government has an entire agency called the Occupational Safety and Health A dministration that is responsible for many of these laws.  Individual states also have their own government agencies or organizations.

In our dialogue, Lon asks Abigail,  “What’s this (what i s this)?”  Abigail says, “It’s a memo about a safety inspection scheduled for next week.”  A “memo” is short for a memorandum.  It’s usually a short, one page, may be two or three page document that is used in offices to give someone informat ion.  Usually it’s used inside a company or inside an organization.  This is a mem o about safety inspections.  A “safety inspection” is when the government agency comes in to where you are working and makes sure that there is nothi ng dangerous about your workplace (the place you work).

Abigail says that their workplace is not unsafe.  Lon is w orried, but Abigail says no, “This isn’t an unsafe workplace.”  “Unsafe” just mean s not safe or dangerous. She says, “We’ve had a good record,” meaning a good histo ry of safe environments for people to work.  She says, “None of our employees have had on-the-job injuries this year.”  The expression “on-the-j ob” means at work, at the place where they are working.  So, none of the employee s hurt themselves at work.  She also says that we’ve never had a fatality.  A “fatality” is a death.  We hope that you don’t have any deaths at your workplace!  T hat would be a fatality.

Abigail says, “I don’t understand why you are so worried.”   Lon says, “From what I’ve heard, the inspectors (the people who come and lo ok at – inspect your workplace) don’t just look at injury (or mortality) rates. ”  When you “injure” yourself you hurt yourself, you harm yourself.  You may bre ak your arm or somehow hurt your foot; that would be an injury.  The “injury rate” would be the

 number of those injuries every month or every year, or perhaps based on every 100 employees, something like that.

Lon says these inspectors look for the smallest hazard (hazard ).  A “hazard” is something that is dangerous, something that can physically hurt you.  For example, you might have some electrical cords on the floor that you could hurt yourself by tripping over.  These would be considered a s afety hazard, something that could hurt someone.  The inspectors look for safety  hazards that would be remotely dangerous.  “Remotely,” here, means a little b it, slightly or barely, not very much but just enough: “remotely dangerous.”

Lon says, “If we get cited (cited), we may be shut down.”   To be “cited,” here, means to be told officially that you are breaking the l aw, that you are doing something against the law, to be told that you are bre aking a rule.  It’s an official declaration – an official statement.  Often, they will give you a piece of paper which is called a “citation.”  To be “cited” has a couple of different in English, however; take a look at our Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

So, Lon is worried about the safety inspectors citing the company, giving them official notice that they are breaking the law, and tha t might lead to then being shut down.  To “shut something down,” or to “shut down”  something is a two- word phrasal verb meaning, in this case, to make the busin ess or the organization close so that it can no longer operate.  Th ey would close your business, that would be to shut the business down.

Abigail says, “With all due respect.”  That expression, “wi th all due respect,” is used when you want to say something that disagrees with w hat someone else has said.  So, you are going to disagree with someone, but you don’t want to hurt that person’s feelings.  You want to do it politely, i n a nice way.  This is often used when you have a more or less serious disagreement with  someone: “With all due respect, I think you’re an idiot.”  That’s what  my professors used to say at the university!

Abigail is much nicer, she says, “With all due respect, I d on’t think that’s how it works.”  She’s saying that Lon is wrong.  “Yes,” she says, “t he inspector will look at our work environment (the place where they work) and our gear and machinery.”  “Gear” (gear) is typically the equipment tha t you use for a job; it could also be the clothing that you wear.  “Machinery” re fers to equipment that’s normally used to “manufacturer,” or make something, to produce something – something physical, that would be a piece of machinery.  So, gear and machinery are going to be inspected by the inspectors to make sure th ere are no hazards or

 toxic substances.  Something that is “toxic” (toxic) means it is poisonous.  It is a chemical usually, that is dangerous for your health; it can  make you very sick.

Lon says, “That’s what I’m worried about.”  He’s worried  about the inspectors finding something.  Abigail says, “But, if they find a vi olation,” an instance where they have broken the law, or broken the rules and regula tions, they will have “a chance to fix the problem.”  That is, the company will be  able to fix the problem before the government agency tells them to shut down.  She says, “They won’t shut us down without giving us a chance to comply with the ir safety standards.” To “comply with” something means to obey a law or a rul e or a regulation, to do something that you are being told to do.  They are go ing to have a chance to comply with the “safety standards.”  Those are the actual r ules that the government has for companies.  Usually they are specific ru les that’s say you have to do so much or you have to have a certain amount  of something.  A “standard” is usually the minimum that you need to do to be able to pass inspection.

Lon says, “I sure hope you’re right.”  Abigail says, “Me,  too (I, as well).”  But we don’t normally say “I, as well,” we would say more infor mally, “me, too.”  Abigail says, “We’ll know after next week’s inspection”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
