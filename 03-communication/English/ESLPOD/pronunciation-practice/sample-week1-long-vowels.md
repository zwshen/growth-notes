# Pronunciation Practice Week 1: Long Vowels /iː/ and /uː/

**Focus Sounds**: /iː/ (as in "see") and /uː/ (as in "too")
**Episode**: DE0001 - Introducing Yourself
**Date**: Week of August 24, 2025
**Practice Duration**: 30 minutes daily

## Target Sounds Analysis

### /iː/ Sound (FLEECE vowel)
- **Mouth Position**: Lips slightly spread, tongue high and forward
- **Common Spellings**: "ee" (see), "ea" (read), "ie" (believe), "e" (me)
- **Duration**: Hold for ~150ms (noticeably longer than /ɪ/)

### /uː/ Sound (GOOSE vowel)
- **Mouth Position**: Lips rounded, tongue high and back
- **Common Spellings**: "oo" (too), "u" (blue), "ew" (new), "ou" (you)
- **Duration**: Hold for ~150ms (longer than /ʊ/)

## Daily Practice Materials from DE0001

### Monday-Tuesday: /iː/ Sound Focus

#### Target Sentences from ESLPOD:
1. "I **grew** up **there** with my parents" (/uː/ in "grew", awareness contrast)
2. "I wasn't much interested in sports, like my **brothers** **were**" (/iː/ sound)
3. "When I returned, I decided to **become** a **teacher**" (/iː/ in "teacher")

#### Minimal Pairs Practice:
- **sheep** /ʃiːp/ vs **ship** /ʃɪp/
- **reach** /riːtʃ/ vs **rich** /rɪtʃ/
- **beat** /biːt/ vs **bit** /bɪt/
- **each** /iːtʃ/ vs **itch** /ɪtʃ/

#### Physical Practice Drill:
1. **Duration Control**: Say "bee" for 3 seconds, gradually reduce to natural length
2. **Mouth Position**: Feel the tension in cheek muscles for /iː/
3. **Mirror Check**: Watch lip spreading for /iː/ vs neutral position

### Wednesday-Thursday: /uː/ Sound Focus

#### Target Sentences from ESLPOD:
1. "I **grew** up there with my parents" (/uː/ in "grew")
2. "I went to **grade** **school** near my **house**" (/uː/ in "school")
3. "I then went to Mexico for a **couple** of years" (awareness of /ʌ/ vs /uː/)

#### Minimal Pairs Practice:
- **pool** /puːl/ vs **pull** /pʊl/
- **Luke** /luːk/ vs **look** /lʊk/
- **suit** /suːt/ vs **soot** /sʊt/
- **food** /fuːd/ vs **foot** /fʊt/

#### Physical Practice Drill:
1. **Lip Rounding**: Exaggerate lip rounding, then normalize
2. **Back Tongue**: Feel tongue pulling back for /uː/
3. **Breath Flow**: Notice how /uː/ blocks more air than /ʊ/

### Friday: Integration & Assessment

#### Combined Practice Sentences:
1. "I **grew** up in **Saint** Paul and went to **school** **there**" (multiple long vowels)
2. "**Three** **years** later, I **chose** to **leave** for the **university**" (mixed vowels)

#### Self-Assessment Checklist:
- [ ] Can distinguish /iː/ from /ɪ/ in isolation
- [ ] Can distinguish /uː/ from /ʊ/ in isolation
- [ ] Can maintain vowel length in connected speech
- [ ] Can identify these sounds when listening to ESLPOD audio
- [ ] Feel more confident with mouth positioning

## Practice Schedule Template

### Daily 30-Minute Session Structure:

**5 minutes**: Physical warm-up
- Jaw stretches and tongue exercises
- Breathing preparation
- Mirror positioning

**10 minutes**: Isolated sound practice
- Minimal pairs (5 minutes)
- Duration control exercises (5 minutes)

**10 minutes**: Sentence integration
- Target sentences from ESLPOD (slow → normal speed)
- Record and compare with original

**5 minutes**: Assessment and logging
- Self-evaluate clarity and accuracy
- Note areas for tomorrow's focus
- Update progress tracking

## Week 1 Learning Goals

### By End of Week, You Should Be Able To:
1. **Hear the difference** between /iː/ vs /ɪ/ and /uː/ vs /ʊ/ consistently
2. **Produce clear distinctions** in minimal pairs with 80%+ accuracy
3. **Maintain vowel quality** when speaking at normal conversational speed
4. **Identify target vowels** when listening to DE0001 without transcript

## Troubleshooting This Week

### Common Problems & Solutions:

**Problem**: "I can't hear the difference between sheep and ship"
- **Solution**: Start with exaggerated versions, use minimal pairs apps, practice with eyes closed

**Problem**: "My /uː/ sounds like /oʊ/ (like 'go')"
- **Solution**: Focus on lip rounding and tongue position, avoid gliding

**Problem**: "I forget to apply this in real speech"
- **Solution**: Practice during self-talk, narrate daily activities using target words

## Connection to Overall ESLPOD Study

### How This Fits Your Broader Learning:
- **Vocabulary**: Better pronunciation aids memory of new words from DE episodes
- **Listening**: Improved discrimination helps understand native speakers better
- **Confidence**: Clearer vowels make you sound more professional and fluent
- **Foundation**: These common vowels appear in many high-frequency words

## Next Week Preview: Short Vowels /ɪ/ and /ʊ/

Building on this week's long vowel work, we'll focus on their short counterparts and master the minimal pair distinctions that often challenge learners.
