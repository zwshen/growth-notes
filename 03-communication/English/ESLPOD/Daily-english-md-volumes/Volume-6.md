This episode is called “Buying Glasses.”  We’re going to li sten to a dialogue between Alice and Pierre talking about someone who nee ds to buy some eyeglasses.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Alice:  Ooh, look at these!  Don’t I look great?  I’ve always wanted sunglasses like these.

Pierre:  You’re supposed to be here helping me pick ou t frames for my new bifocals.

Alice:  I don’t know why you won’t get progressives.  Tha t’s what everybody is getting these days.

Pierre:  I’ve always had bifocals and that’s what I’m go ing to get.

Alice:  Are you going to get metal, plastic, or rimless f rames?

Pierre:  I’m not sure.  The optician said that with my prescription, I could get any kind.

Alice:  Okay, try these.  How do they feel?

Pierre:  I like the way the hinges move, but they’re to o small for my head.  Hey, these are nice.  I think I’ll go with these.

 Alice:  There’s no accounting for taste!  Okay, but what a bout the lenses?  There are so many options.  You can get ones that reduce glare,  ones that darken automatically, ones with anti-scratch coating…

Pierre:  I want to keep it nice and simple.  I don’t want any of those options.

Alice:  How about these for a backup pair?  They’re desi gner frames.

Pierre:  Give me those.  I should have known better th an to let you tag along. What was I thinking?!

[end of dialogue]

Alice says to Pierre, “Ooh, look at these!  Don’t I look g reat?  I’ve always wanted sunglasses like these.”  “Don’t I look great?” of course, me ans I look great in these, don’t I, asking for the other person to agree.  Alice says that she’s always wanted sunglasses like these.  “Sunglasses” are glasses we use t o protect our eyes from very bright sunshine.

Pierre says, “You’re supposed to be here helping me pick o ut frames for my new bifocals.”  Pierre is saying that Alice is supposed to be h elping him pick out frames.  “Frames” are the metal or plastic part of your  glasses that hold in what we call the “lenses,” the things that you see through, m ade of glass or plastic. The frames can be metal or plastic, and they go behind y our ear so that they stay up – so that they stay in place.

Pierre needs to get bifocals.  “Bifocals” are glasses that have two sections with a small line separating them.  The largest section is for se eing distance; that is, seeing things that are far away.  And, bifocals typically have reading glasses, or a reading section in the glasses.  That’s a smaller sectio n of the lens which you use to read.  So, you can have one pair of glasses to do t wo different things. “Bi,” of course, means two.  I have bifocals, so I can see f ar, when I’m driving for example, and I also can see close up when I’m reading.

Alice says to Pierre, “I don’t know why you won’t get prog ressives.” “Progressives” is a special kind of glasses that have two or t hree sections.  There is a section on the top that helps you see far away, a secti on in the middle of the lens that helps you see a medium distance – not too far, not too close, and then there’s a section that helps you see things close, for exa mple when you’re reading.  The difference is that progressives don’t have a little line that separates the different parts of the lens, whereas a bifocal wou ld.  “Progressive” has a

 couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Alice says, “everybody is getting progressives these days (nowada ys).”  Pierre says, “I’ve always had bifocals and that’s what I’m going t o get.”  Alice asks him, “Are you going to get metal, plastic, or rimless frames? ”  “Metal” is something that is hard; a material made of iron, steel, aluminu m, those would all be metals. Silver, gold, and nickel are also metals.  “Plastic” is a st rong material that is made by taking petroleum (oil) and making it into a hard ob ject.  “Rimless glasses” are glasses that don’t have any edges.  The lens – remember t he lens is the part of the glasses that you see out of – that you look out of –  they are attached to the frames, but there is not any plastic or metal around the  actual glass or plastic lenses, so it looks like you just have these two lenses sitting  in front of your eyes. The “rim” (rim) of the glasses are the parts that go ar ound the lens – the edge of the lenses.  “Rimless” would be without a rim, and that ’s what rimless glasses are.

Well, Pierre says, “I’m not sure.  The optician said that  with my prescription, I could get any kind (I could get frames that are metal, p lastic, or rimless).”  The “optician” is the person who makes the glasses, puts the gl asses together, and helps people put on the glasses.  Usually if you are goin g to have your eyes checked, you go to a doctor called an “optometrist,” but i f you are just buying glasses, then you would go to an optician.  The optician is not a doctor; it is a person who knows about how glasses are made and helps you se lect a pair and put them on your face.  When you have your eyes examined b y the optometrist and they determine you need glasses, you are given somethin g called a “prescription,” which is a piece of paper where the doct or writes down what kind of glasses you need.  We use that same word if a doctor is giving you some sort of drug; they would write down the name of the medici ne.  That’s your “prescription,” it’s the piece of paper that has that i nformation, usually with the doctor’s signature, that you then bring in order to ge t your glasses or your drugs.

Alice says, “Okay, try these.  How do they feel?”  Pierre sa ys, “I like the way the hinges move, but they’re too small for my head.”  A “hin ge” (hinge) is a small piece of metal that connects two larger pieces of wood,  plastic, or metal.  If you have a door in your house, there are at least two hinge s.  The door opens and closes, but there’s a metal plate that connects the door to the wall, and that allows you to open the door.  So the hinge opens and cl oses; it’s flexible.  Your glasses have hinges – if you have glasses – that connect the lens part of the glasses – the lens part of the frame with the pieces of t he frame that go on either side of your head and behind your ears.  So, Pierre like s the hinges on the pair of glasses that Alice showed him, but he says they’re too small  for his head.

 Obviously, he has a very big head!  “Hinge” has a couple of  meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Pierre says, “Hey, these are nice.  I’ll go with these,” meaning I’ll select these. Alice says, “There’s no accounting for taste!”  The expression  “there’s no accounting for taste” is used to show that you don’t like  another person’s choice of style or fashion.  To say “there’s no accounting for” m eans there’s no way to explain.  So, everyone has different tastes – a different  sense of style and fashion.

Alice doesn’t like Pierre’s taste; she obviously doesn’t like the pair of glasses that Pierre is trying on.  Alice says, “Okay, but what about the  lenses?” the clear, plastic, or glass pieces that you see through.  You also ca ll that clear piece of plastic or glass in a camera a lens.  Alice says, “There are  so many options.  You can get lenses that reduce glare, ones that darken auto matically, ones with anti- scratch coating.”  “Glare” (glare) is a bright light tha t is reflected off of a piece of glass or plastic.  If you have glasses that reduce glare – t hey make it less, that means you won’t have that problem with the bright like reflecting off the glass or the plastic.  It’s also possible to get lenses that darken a utomatically, so instead of having a pair of glasses that you use inside the house and another pair of sunglasses that you use outside, you can get lenses that will  automatically darken when you go outside into the light.  I had these  for a few years when I was in high school, but they were rather inconvenient beca use it takes a while for the lenses to darken and to brighten up – to un-darken , so they weren’t very convenient in my opinion.  Lenses can also have anti-scratch co ating.  A “scratch” is when you make a mark on a piece of glass or pla stic that you don’t want; you can also scratch, for example the back of a watch o r the front of a watch.  “Coating” is something that goes over something e lse, usually to protect it.  So, “anti-scratch coating” is a special chemical they p ut over the glass – over the lenses that prevents it from getting scratched.

Pierre says however, “I want to keep it nice and simple,” meaning very simple.  “I don’t want any of those options.”  Alice says, “How about these for a backup pair?  They’re designer frames.”  Something that “backs u p” something else is something that you use in case the first thing doesn’t wo rk or the first thing doesn’t operate properly.  If you have a computer, you should also have another external disk drive or some sort of online service that backs up your files.  Notice it can be used as a verb as well: “to backup.”  I back up  my files every day on an external hard drive.  “Backup pair” refers to a pair of glasses that you use in case your first ones break or you have a problem with them.

 Alice is looking at a pair of designer frames.  “Designer ” means that they are made by a company; they’re usually of a certain style or shap e and they’re usually more expensive.  So if you buy a dress made and desi gned by Versace, for example, or you buy something made by Prada, these are designer products; they are things that have a very special and unique sort of design to them.

Pierre says, “Give me those.  I should have known better th an to let you tag along.  What was I thinking?!”  “To tag” (tag) – some would pronounce it “tag,” but in my Minnesota accent it’s “tag” – “to tag along” means to go with someone somewhere they’re going even though you are not invited  initially or the person is going even if you don’t go with them.  So, if your old er brother is going to the movies you may say, “Can I tag along?” meaning can I go wi th you, you didn’t invite me but I’d like to go.  In this case, Alice tags al ong with Pierre to buy some glasses.  Pierre is wishing that he never invited her to co me with him.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Alice:  Ooh, look at these!  Don’t I look great?  I’ve always wanted sunglasses like these.

Pierre:  You’re supposed to be here helping me pick ou t frames for my new bifocals.

Alice:  I don’t know why you won’t get progressives.  Tha t’s what everybody is getting these days.

Pierre:  I’ve always had bifocals and that’s what I’m go ing to get.

Alice:  Are you going to get metal, plastic, or rimless f rames?

Pierre:  I’m not sure.  The optician said that with my prescription, I could get any kind.

Alice:  Okay, try these.  How do they feel?

Pierre:  I like the way the hinges move, but they’re to o small for my head.  Hey, these are nice.  I think I’ll go with these.

 Alice:  There’s no accounting for taste!  Okay, but what a bout the lenses? There’s so many options.  You can get ones that reduce g lare, ones that darken automatically, ones with anti-scratch coating…

Pierre:  I want to keep it nice and simple.  I don’t want any of those options.

Alice:  How about these for a backup pair?  They’re desi gner frames.

Pierre:  Give me those.  I should have known better th an to let you tag along. What was I thinking?!

# Storing Luggage on an Airplane

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 02: Storing Luggage on an Airplane.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 502.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  How are you today?   Well, good.  Thank you for asking; I’m fine, too.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes, and a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

On this episode, we’re going to be talking about taking  “luggage,” which are your bags where you put your clothing and so forth, on an air plane.  It will be a dialogue between Yoshi and Tatiana using a lot of comm on vocabulary we use to describe luggage for traveling.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Yoshi:  Can you hold my jacket while I try to get my rolle r bag down the aisle?

Tatiana:  All right, but I have to roll my own bag d own the aisle, you know.

Yoshi:  Fine, give it back to me.  All of these overhead  bins are full.  Where are we supposed to store them?

Tatiana:  Look, there are two spaces in the back of the p lane.  You put our big bags in those bins, and I’ll put our carry-ons under t he seats in front of us.

Yoshi:  Fine, but these seats are already cramped, and now, I’ll have no legroom for the entire flight.  Great!  That’s what we get f or not getting seats in the emergency exit row.

Tatiana:  If we had seats in the emergency exit row, you’ d be complaining about not being able to recline in your seat right now.  At  least we don’t have bulkhead seats.  Stop grumbling and get moving before somebody el se snags those overhead bins and we have to check those bags.

Yoshi:  Whose idea was it to go on vacation?

 Tatiana:  It was mine.  We both need some time to get  away and unwind.

Yoshi:  Yeah, right, I can’t remember the last time I  felt this relaxed!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Yoshi saying to Tatiana, “Can you hold my jacket (my coat) while I try to get my roller bag down the aisle?”   A “roller (roller) bag” is a suitcase that is on wheels.  It has, typically, a long “han dle,” something that you can pull it so you don’t have to carry it.  It has wheels so you can just pull it along the ground – along the floor.  That’s why it’s called a roller bag, because it rolls. Something that “rolls” is something like a wheel that g oes around and around.

Yoshi is on the airplane, and in the center of the air plane, on a small airplane, there are seats on both sides, typically three seats on each  side, and in the middle where you walk up and down the airplane is calle d the “aisle” (aisle). Notice that Yoshi says that he wants to get his bag down the aisle.  We use “down the…” when we are talking about walking, usually on a flat surface such as on the street or on the floor.  You can walk down t he street, that means you are walking on the sidewalk next to the street – we hope .  So, “down” is just indicating that you are walking on or along a certain place.  “Down” and “up” are sometimes used for directions as well: you can walk down t he stairs, meaning you are going from a higher place to a lower place.  O r you could walk up the stairs, meaning you were going from a lower place to a higher place.  But here, “down the aisle” simply means along this particular path.

Tatiana says, “All right, but I have to roll my own bag  down the aisle, you know.” Yoshi says, “Fine, give it back to me,” meaning his jacket.  Tatiana is complaining that she doesn’t have an extra hand – an extra arm, becau se she has to roll her bag down the aisle.  Yoshi says, “All of these overhead b ins are full.”  On an airplane, inside the airplane, above the seats there a re spaces where you can put your luggage – your bags.  And then, after you put your bags in you close the door.  Those things are called “overhead bins” (bins).  A  “bin” is simply a container – a large container.  “Overhead” refers to the fact that they are over your head; you are sitting in the chair and they are abo ve you.  So, “overhead” means above.

Yoshi complains that the overhead bins are full, there’s no more room.  He asks, “Where are we supposed to store them (to store our lugg age)?”  “To store,” as a verb, means to keep something in a safe place for a per iod of time, something that you are planning on using later.  So, I may have l ots of extra books that don’t

 fit on my bookshelf; I put them in a box and I store th em in my garage.  I keep them there until I’m ready to use them again.

Tatiana says, “Look, there are two spaces in the back of the plane.  You put our big bags in those bins, and I’ll put our carry-ons under  the seat in front of us.” So, Tatiana is telling Yoshi to take the two large bag s and put them in an open space – an open bin in the back of the plane.  She will  then take their two smaller bags, what we call “carry-on bags,” because you can carry the m onto the plane – you can bring them onto the plane.  She’s going to stor e the carry-on bags underneath the seat in front of them, because there’s a  space in the airplane in front of the seat that you are sitting in, typically, wh ere you can put a small bag, or your shoes, or purse, or a young child who is not beha ving, who is making noise.  You can put all those in the space in front of yo u.  I’m just kidding about the child, of course!

Yoshi says, “Fine, but these seats are already cramped, and  now, I have no legroom for the entire flight.”  This Yoshi does nothi ng but complain, I’m telling you!  Yoshi says these seats are cramped.  “To be cramped” m eans to be crowded; there’s not enough room.  He says that he has no  legroom for the flight. “Legroom” is space in front of you where you can, especia lly if you have long legs, extend your legs.  But if you have something in the seat – below the seat in front of you, well then, you don’t have any room to pu t your legs there.

Yoshi says, “Great!  That’s what we get for not getting seats in the emergency exit row.”  Each line of seats is called a “row,” typically there’ll be anywhere between 25 and maybe 55 or more rows in an airplane –  in a big airplane.  The “emergency exit” is the place where if the plane has a pr oblem, if the plane has to land or the plane goes down before you get to the airport (something that I don’t recommend!) then you may have to escape, you may have  to get out of the airplane through the emergency exits.  They aren’t the e xits that you normally take to get out of the airplane, but in an emergency, especially if it’s in middle of the plane, those are the ones that you would use.  The  emergency exit rows are always a little bit “roomier,” that is, there’s more spa ce between the row of seats and the row of seats in front it, so there’s more room  for your legs.  That’s why many people try to get the emergency exit row seats.

Tatiana says, “If we had seats in the emergency exit row,  you’d be complaining about not being able to recline in your seat right n ow.”  In the emergency exit row, especially if there are two exit rows, typically one or both the rows will have seats than do not lean back.  Normally in an airplane wh en you sit down, you can press a small button and you can put your seat back farthe r – the top part of your seat, so you can rest or sleep.  But in the emergency exit r ow, sometimes you

 can’t do that because they want to have nothing in the w ay in case of an emergency so people can get out the emergency exits.  “To r ecline” means to put the seat back.  We have a noun, a “recliner,” that’s a b ig chair, usually in your living room, that you can push the back all the way so it i s almost flat.  That’s what you can do in an airplane, or most airplanes, you ca n recline your seat, using “recline” as a verb here meaning to lean backwards.

Tatiana then says, “At least we don’t have bulkhead seats. ”  A “bulkhead” (bulkhead) is a word that describes a type of wall that se parates different parts of the plane; it can also separate different parts of a sh ip.  Usually, if you have a seat in front of the bulkhead – in front of some wall on the airplane, you can’t put anything in front of you because there is no seat directly in front of you.  That would be a problem for Tatiana and Yoshi, since they do n’t have enough room for their bags in the overhead bins.

Tatiana then says to Yoshi, “Stop grumbling and get movi ng.”  “To grumble” (grumble) means to complain, to say something negative b ut not in a loud voice, in a quiet voice.  You may say, “Oh, people with those kid s, they keep yelling, and that cat keeps screaming, and…”  That would be to g rumble; you say something negative, you complain, but you don’t say it very loudly.  Well, Yoshi is grumbling, so Tatiana tells him to stop grumbling and “get moving,” meaning start to walk forward; hurry up and begin what you are suppose d to do, which in this case is to move forward to their seats.  “Move” has many d ifferent meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for a furt her definition of that and the word “store” that we used earlier in the episode.

Tatiana says that Yoshi has to get moving before somebody else snags those overhead bins.  “To snag” (snag) means to grab or get so mething quickly, especially before someone else gets them.  So when you wal k into a movie theater, you may want to snag the best seats as soon as you walk in; you’re going to find the best seats so that no one else sits th ere before you.  Tatiana wants Yoshi to snag the overhead bins – to go and put th eir bags in the overhead bins, because if they don’t fit in the overhead bins the n they have to, typically, check their bags.  “To check your bag” means to give your sui tcase – your luggage to the airline employee and they put it unde rneath the plane.  This means that you have to wait when you get to wherever you ’re going in order to get your bag back, so many people don’t like to check their bags.  But now, with new security regulations, many people, probably most peopl e who are staying overnight check their bags.

Yoshi says, “Whose idea was it to go on vacation?”  Tatiana  says, “It was mine. We both needed some time to get away and unwind.”  “T o unwind” (unwind)

 means to relax, to stop being anxious, to stop feeling st ressed.  Of course, Yoshi is not unwinding; he says, “Yeah, right, I can’t rememb er the last time I felt this relaxed!”  He’s making a joke.  “I can’t remember the la st time I felt this relaxed” means this is a very rare thing for me to be so relaxed.  Of course, he isn’t relaxed; he’s very stressed and complaining and grumbling a ll the time, even though he is on his vacation.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Yoshi:  Can you hold my jacket while I try to get my rolle r bag down the aisle?

Tatiana:  All right, but I have to roll my own bag d own the aisle, you know.

Yoshi:  Fine, give it back to me.  All of these overhead  bins are full.  Where are we supposed to store them?

Tatiana:  Look, there are two spaces in the back of the p lane.  You put our big bags in those bins, and I’ll put our carry-ons under t he seats in front of us.

Yoshi:  Fine, but these seats are already cramped, and now, I’ll have no legroom for the entire flight.  Great!  That’s what we get f or not getting seats in the emergency exit row.

Tatiana:  If we had seats in the emergency exit row, you’ d be complaining about not being able to recline in your seat right now.  At  least we don’t have bulkhead seats.  Stop grumbling and get moving before somebody el se snags those overhead bins and we have to check those bags.

Yoshi:  Whose idea was it to go on vacation?

Tatiana:  It was mine.  We both need some time to get  away and unwind.

Yoshi:  Yeah, right, I can’t remember the last time I  felt this relaxed!

# Seeing a Dentist

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 03: Seeing a Dentist.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 503.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes, and, most importantly, a complete transcript of everything we say on  this episode.

This episode is about doing something I love to do, going to see the dentist.  It’ll be a dialogue between Dr. Chung and Luis about some w ork that Luis needs to have done on his teeth.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Dr. Chung:  Hello, Luis, I’m Dr. Chung.  You’re here  for a check-up and a cleaning, is that right?

Luis:  Yes, that’s right.

Dr. Chung:  Okay, let’s take a look.  Have you had your wi sdom teeth taken out?

Luis:  No, I haven’t.

Dr. Chung:  Hmm…You may need to do that soon.  You’ve had a root canal?

Luis:  Yes, about three years ago.

Dr. Chung:  Does that hurt?

Luis:  Ow!

Dr. Chung:  I guess I hit a nerve.  The bad news is that  you may need another root canal soon.  Let’s see if you have any cavities.  Oh, I think there’s one here in your left molar.  You’ll need to come back for a fil ling.  Are you experiencing any sensitivity?

 Luis:  Yes, I am!

Dr. Chung:  I’m not surprised.  Your gums have receded and some of the root is showing.  Do you use dental floss?

Luis:  Um, yes.

Dr. Chung:  I’ll have the dental hygienist show you how  to brush and floss better so you can prevent the buildup of plaque and tartar.  A ny questions for me before the hygienist starts on your cleaning?

Luis:  No, I’m just glad you didn’t say I need dentures!

Dr. Chung:  No, you don’t.  Not yet.

[end of dialogue]

Our episode begins with Dr. Chung introducing herself to her “patient,” the person she is taking care of, Luis.  She says, “Hello, Luis,  I’m Dr. Chung.  You’re here for a check-up and a cleaning, is that right?”  Typi cally, every six months or so it’s recommended that you go to a dentist and get a c heck-up.  A “check-up” is another word for an exam,  where a dentist or a doctor  looks at your general health to see if there are any problems.  A dentist wi ll look at your teeth to make sure that there aren’t any problems inside your mouth.  A “cleaning” is when a dental professional – it could be the doctor, but more typically it’s someone who works with the doctor, someone we would call a “hygienist”  – comes and cleans your teeth, removes anything on your teeth that shouldn’t  be there.

Luis says, “Yes, that’s right (yes, I’m here for a check-up an d a cleaning).”  Dr. Chung says, “Okay, let’s take a look (let’s look at you).  H ave you had your wisdom teeth taken out?”  Your “wisdom teeth” are the four large teeth that are in the back of your mouth; they usually begin to appear in your late teens or early 20s.  Many people need to have these teeth removed becau se there isn’t enough room in their mouth.  Except me; I have a big mouth, so , at least that’s what my mother told me!  Well, to remove these teeth means to  have a special surgery, and it can sometimes be a little painful.  So, this is what your wisdom teeth are. Not quite sure why they’re called your wisdom teeth; I su ppose you don’t get them until you’re older and, we hope, a little wiser  – a little smarter.

Luis says, “I haven’t,” meaning I have not had my wisdom te eth taken out.  “To take out” means to remove.  Dr. Chung says, “Hmm…You may ne ed to do that soon.”  Then she says, “You’ve had a root canal?”  A “roo t (root) canal” is a

 procedure, which can be painful, where a dentist takes o ut a damaged part of your tooth that is below the skin, so it’s actually inside of your mouth, and the dentist will often have to make a hole in your teeth i n order to repair the damage underneath your teeth.  I’ve had a couple of root cana ls; they’re not fun.  I wouldn’t do one just because it feels good; in fact, it doesn’t feel very good at all! The “root” is the bottom of your teeth.  That word, “ root,” is also used with a tree or a plant, and that refers to the part of the tree  or the plant that is below the ground, that is in the dirt.  So, your root for your t eeth are underneath the skin. “Canal,” here, just means a hole.

Luis says that he had a root canal about three years ago.  Dr. Chung touches the tooth where the root canal was and asks, “Does that hurt ?” and Luis says, “Ow!” which is how you express pain, at least in English.  Dr. C hung says, “I guess I hit a nerve.”  The “nerves” of your body are the parts that  carry messages to your brain, sending information about pain, about tempera ture, about touch.  It’s something that if you touch it and there’s a problem wi th the nerve – if the nerve is damaged – it can be very painful.

Dr. Chung says, “The bad news is that you may need anothe r root canal soon.” Even though he had a root canal that was supposed to fi x the problem the first time, it didn’t, and now he has to have another root canal.  Lucky Luis!  Dr. Chung also says that she wants to look at Luis to see if he has any cavities. “Cavity” (cavity) is a small hole; in this case, a small hol e in a tooth, and if you don’t fix the hole – if don’t fill in the hole (put something there), it could damage or hurt your teeth.  In fact, Dr. Chung says that Luis ha s to come back to her office to get a filling.  A “filing” is a small amoun t of metal that is put into this little hole – this cavity – to cover and protect the teeth so tha t they are not damaged further.  He has a cavity in his left molar (molar).  Y our “molars” are your large teeth.  They don’t have a pointed top on them.  They’r e usually – well, they’re always in the back of your mouth.  We use these for chewin g our food.  So, he has a cavity in one of his molars.  The doctor then asks him,  “Are you experiencing any sensitivity?”  “Sensitivity,” in this case, wo uld mean some sort of pain when you touch something, even if you just touch i t very lightly – you just barely touch it, you could have sensitivity and that woul d cause pain.

Luis says, “Yes, I am!” meaning I am experiencing this pain ful sensitivity.  Dr. Chung says, “I’m not surprised.  Your gums have receded and  some of the root is showing.  Don’t you use dental floss?”  Your “gums” i n your teeth are the pink skin that covers the bottom of your teeth.  When we say some thing has “receded,” we mean that it has moved back or pulled awa y from something else. So, if your gums are in a poor condition, one thing th at can happen is that the gums begin to pull away from the teeth, to go down, a nd that can cause

 problems.  One of the problems is that some of the root  of the tooth could be exposed, and that can cause pain.  The root is the part, remember, of the tooth that is below the surface, that you can’t normally see.

Dr. Chung asks Luis if he’s using dental floss.  “Dental floss” is a long piece of thin string that you usually hold between your two finge rs, and you move it in between your teeth in order to clean your teeth.  It’ s something you would do in addition to brushing your teeth, which, of course, is to  take a small toothbrush and move it back and forth against the front and back of the teeth to clean them. Floss is something that goes in between the teeth.

Luis says he uses dental floss, though we’re not quite sure .  Dr. Chung then says, “I’ll have the dental hygienist show you how to brush and floss better so you can prevent the buildup of plaque and tartar.”  Co uple of different words there: First, the dental hygienist is the person who wo rks with the dentist, who is not usually a doctor, whose job it is to clean your teeth  and to check your teeth. The dental hygienist is going to show Luis how to brush a nd floss better so he can prevent the buildup of plaque and tartar.  “Build up” means accumulation, when you have a little bit of material and you keep ad ding, over a long period of time, a little more and a little more and a little more.  That can happen on your teeth.  It can happen with two things called “plaque ” (plaque) and “tartar” (tartar). “Plaque” is a thin layer of food and bacteria that cover s your teeth after you eat that you need to remove after you eat with a toothbrus h.  Otherwise, it can damage or hurt your teeth.  “Tartar” is a hard yellow layer on your teeth.  When you do not remove the plaque regularly, then you can get  this yellow layer, and that’s why some people have yellow teeth, because the plaq ue has built up so much that it has now become tartar.  By the way, I’m not  a dentist so I hope I got that explanation right!

Dr. Chung says, “Any questions for me before the hygienist  starts on your cleaning?” and Luis says, “No, I’m just glad you didn’t say I need dentures!” “Dentures” are basically false teeth, fake teeth, artifi cial teeth that you wear instead of your real teeth.  So, Dr. Chung is not saying  that Luis’s teeth are so bad he needs dentures.  She says, “Not yet,” meaning if y ou don’t change your ways it may be something you need in the future.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Dr. Chung:  Hello, Luis, I’m Dr. Chung.  You’re here  for a check-up and a cleaning, is that right?

 Luis:  Yes, that’s right.

Dr. Chung:  Okay, let’s take a look.  Have you had your wi sdom teeth taken out?

Luis:  No, I haven’t.

Dr. Chung:  Hmm…You may need to do that soon.  You’ve had a root canal?

Luis:  Yes, about three years ago.

Dr. Chung:  Does that hurt?

Luis:  Ow!

Dr. Chung:  I guess I hit a nerve.  The bad news is that  you may need another root canal soon.  Let’s see if you have any cavities.  Oh, I think there’s one here in your left molar.  You’ll need to come back for a fil ling.  Are you experiencing any sensitivity?

Luis:  Yes, I am!

Dr. Chung:  I’m not surprised.  Your gums have receded and some of the root is showing.  Do you use dental floss?

Luis:  Um, yes.

Dr. Chung:  I’ll have the dental hygienist show you how  to brush and floss better so you can prevent the buildup of plaque and tartar.  A ny questions for me before the hygienist starts on your cleaning?

Luis:  No, I’m just glad you didn’t say I need dentures!

Dr. Chung:  No, you don’t.  Not yet.

# Training Inexperienced Employees

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 04: Training Inexperienced Employees.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 504.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page guide that will help you im prove your English even faster.

This episode is called “Training Inexperienced Employees.”  It’s a dialogue between Kazuko and Martin using a lot of vocabulary that  relates to experience or “inexperience” (someone without experience) at wor k.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kazuko:  I really appreciate you helping with the traini ng of the newbies.  I couldn’t have done it without you.

Martin:  Don’t mention it.  I remember when I was sti ll wet behind the ears and the veterans in the company gave me the benefit of thei r time and expertise. They propped me up until I could stand on my own two feet.

Kazuko:  I can’t imagine you as a novice.  Everybody here th inks of you as the cornerstone of the institution.

Martin:  Well, that may be, but you should have seen m e in the early years.  I was naïve and reckless.  I may be more adept at my job now , but I felt inept for years.

Kazuko:  I saw you talking with some of the new recruits.  What advice did you give them?

Martin:  I gave them the same advice that an old hand g ave me when I first started: Take every piece of advice you get with a grain of salt!

[end of dialogue]

 Kazuko begins by telling Martin that she really appreciat es him helping with the training of the newbies.  A “newbie” (newbie) is an i nformal term used to describe someone who’s a beginner, someone who’s a novice, someone who is new at something.  Kazuko says, “I couldn’t have done it without yo u.”  Martin says, “Don’t mention it,” meaning not at all, not a probl em.  “I remember when I was still wet behind the ears and the veterans in the compan y gave me the benefit of their time and expertise.”  The expression “to be wet b ehind the ears” means to be inexperienced, to be doing something for the first t ime, not to know exactly what you’re doing.  I’m not sure where the expression com es from, but it’s a common enough one.  When you say someone is “wet behind t he ears,” you mean they don’t know what they’re doing, they’re new a t something, they’re inexperienced.  A “veteran,” here, means someone who has a lot of experience, someone who has done something for a long time.  A vete ran teacher is someone who has been a teacher for long time.  The wor d “veteran” can also describe someone who was once part of a country’s army or mi litary forces, but here it just means someone with a lot of experience.

The veterans in the company gave Martin “the benefit of”  (the advantages of) their time and “expertise,” meaning their knowledge a bout something – their deep knowledge, their considerable understanding about someth ing.  He says, “They propped me up until I could stand on my own two feet. ”  “To prop up (something)” or “to prop (something or someone) up” is a phrasal verb  meaning to support someone or something, to help someone do something – t o accomplish something.  So, in this case, because Martin didn’t have very much experience, he needed help; he needed other people to help him do what he needed to do, and they propped him up until he could stand on his ow n two feet.  “To stand on your own two feet” means to be independent, to do some thing without help from other people.

Kazuko says, “I can’t imagine you as a novice.”  A “novice” (n ovice) is a newbie, someone who is doing something for the first time, or s omeone who doesn’t have very much experience.  If you were beginning to learn the  piano, for example, you could say, “I’m a novice (I’m not very good, I’m a begi nner).”  Well, Kazuko says she can’t imagine Martin as a novice, “Everybody here thi nks of you as the cornerstone of the institution.”  The “cornerstone” is, i n this case, someone or something that is necessary for the success of a project or a company; something that is absolutely vital, important, something  you could not do without. The word “cornerstone” comes from architecture.  It’s the  actual piece of stone that you would put in the corner of a building, where  the two walls would meet. More generally, “cornerstone” is the part of the buildi ng that is often dedicated at the beginning of the construction of an important buil ding.  When used normally

 in conversation, it means the foundation, the thing tha t is very necessary or important.

Martin says, “Well, that may be (I may be thought of as t he cornerstone of this institution), but you should have seen me in my early year s.  I was naïve and reckless.”  “Naïve” (naïve) means that you don’t have a lot  of experience in life, so you have to trust other people.  Naïve is usually consid ered a bad thing; it’s when you trust other people too much and you believe thi ngs that you shouldn’t believe.  For example, if your new girlfriend tells you  that she’s going to have dinner with her ex-boyfriend because they’re just friend s, you might not want to be so naïve as to think that perhaps there isn’t something  else going on there. That would be an example of being naïve, perhaps.  the same would be especially so if it happened with your boyfriend.  If your  new boyfriend says they’re going to have dinner with their ex-girlfriend , you should probably maybe go with!  “To be reckless” means to things that are risky, without thinking about the danger involved.  We have an expression “reckless drivin g,” that’s when people drive their cars without any concern about how da ngerous driving can be, and, for example, they may hit another car or hurt peop le.  That is reckless driving, driving in a way that could cause an accident or d oes cause an accident.

Martin says, “I may be more adept at my job now, but I f elt inept for years.”  We have two words here that end in “ept”: “adept” (adept ) and “inept” (inept).  “To be adept” means to be able to do something easily, quickly, a nd well.  “My mother is adept at cooking (she can cook very well).”  That’s just an example, however! “Inept” means incapable, unable to do something, witho ut the ability to do something well.  “I am inept at playing the violin (I’ m not very good at it).”  Notice that both with “adept” and with “inept” we use the p reposition “at”: “I am adept at making cakes.”  The verb is in the “ing” after the “at.”  “I am inept at driving” – “ing” form.

Kazuko says, “I saw you talking with some of the new recrui ts.  What advice did you give them?”  A “recruit” is someone who has recently jo ined an organization. We usually talk about “recruits” as new employees, often p eople that we try to go and find and hire.  The army, the navy, the military fo rces also have recruits; these are people that they want to get to join the ar my and then join the military service.

Kazuko asks what advice Martin gave the new recruits.  Marti n says, “I gave them the same advice as an old hand gave me when I firs t started.”  The expression “an old hand” means a person who has a lot of experience doing something, someone who knows how to do something very wel l.  “Hand” has several different meanings in English; take a look at ou r Learning Guide for some

 additional explanations.  Martin says, “I gave them the s ame advice that an old hand gave me when I first started: Take every piece of a dvice you get with a grain of salt!”  “To take (something) with a grain of salt” is an old expression that means not to believe everything that you are told, to decide which things you are going to believe.  Of course, Martin is giving this as a piece of advice, that the recruits take advice from people like him with a grain of  salt.  Of course, if we take his advice about taking advice with a grain of salt, w ell, you see the problem – we’re not sure what to believe!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kazuko:  I really appreciate you helping with the traini ng of the newbies.  I couldn’t have done it without you.

Martin:  Don’t mention it.  I remember when I was sti ll wet behind the ears and the veterans in the company gave me the benefit of thei r time and expertise. They propped me up until I could stand on my own two feet.

# Teaching Children About Safety

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 05: Teaching Children About Safety.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 505.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode to help improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Teaching Children About Safety.”   It’s about a teacher, Ms. Sanchez, who goes to class thinking that she needs to tel l her students all about safety, but she gets a surprise at the end.  Let’ s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ms. Sanchez:  Okay, kids.  I’m Ms. Sanchez, your substitute for this week.  I’m taking all of you on the field trip tomorrow.  Listen  up.  There are some ground rules we need to go over.  First, each of you will have a  partner and you will hold hands while we cross the streets.

Student:  Ms. Sanchez…?

Ms. Sanchez:  I’ll take questions later.  Let me get thr ough all of my instructions first.  Remember, don’t talk to strangers.  There are p redators out there who are looking to lure children away from their family and fri ends and to abduct them, so don’t let your guard down.

Student:  Ms. Sanchez…

Ms. Sanchez:  As I said, I’ll take questions later.  If you  need to step away from the group, ask permission first.  If a stranger tries to a ccost or waylay you, run away as fast as you can.

Student:  Uh, Ms. Sanchez?

Ms. Sanchez:  Yes?

Student:  I think you’ve got the wrong classroom.  We’re the eighth graders.  The first graders are on the second floor.

 Ms. Sanchez:  Where are my glasses?  Oh, here they are.  Oh !  You’re not my first-graders!  Why didn’t anyone say anything earlier?!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the teacher, Ms. Sanchez, saying to her students, “Okay, kids.  I’m Ms. Sanchez, your substitute for this week. ”  “Substitute,” here, stands for a substitute teacher, who is a teacher who teach es a class temporarily when the regular teacher is sick or for some reason cannot be in class.  Here in the United States most school districts – most schools have a list of teachers they can call in the morning and say, “Well, we need some one to teach this class,” and the substitute teacher comes in and takes over t he class for that day, not necessarily teaching the class.  Often you get substitute  teachers who don’t know anything about the topic, but at least there is an adult standing in front of the children so they don’t – uh, I don’t know – jump o ut the window!

In this case, Ms. Sanchez is the substitute teacher for the week.  She says, “I’m taking all of you on the field trip tomorrow.”  A “fi eld trip” is an experience where students go somewhere outside of the school; they go on a little trip organized by the school so they can learn something.  They may go to a museum; they may go to a park; they make go to see some performance, a pl ay for example; all of these would be field trips.  Students always love field t rips because they don’t have to stay in their regular boring class anymore.

Ms. Sanchez says to the students, “Listen up,” meaning ever yone listen.  “There are some ground rules we need to go over.”  “Ground ru les” are basic rules, things that everyone must do.  She says we need to go over  these ground rules. “To go over” is a phrasal verb meaning to review, to tal k about something together, and make sure that everyone understands it.  “ Go,” as you know, has many meanings depending on the preposition you put afte r it; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more phrasal verbs with “to go. ”

Ms. Sanchez says, “First, each of you will have a partner a nd you will hold hands while we cross the streets.”  A “partner” is one half of a pair.  One person with another person, those two people are together; we co uld call them partners.  You can be married and call your wife or husband your partn er.  But in school, many times children work in pairs, two children work together  or are together – sit together.  In this case, the children are going to have partners and they will need to hold hands while they cross the streets.  “To hold hand s” means to put your hand into someone else’s hand, and, in this case, you’re  going to hold the other person’s hand while you walk across a street.  This is especial ly true for young

 children so that the children don’t run off in a numbe r of different directions when they’re crossing the street; that would be dangerous.

So, one of the students in Ms. Sanchez’s class says, “Ms. Sanc hez…?” trying to ask a question.  But Ms. Sanchez says, “I’ll take questions lat er.”  She continues, “Let me get through all of my instructions first.”  “To  get through (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to finish something, to complete so mething.  Ms. Sanchez wants to get through all of her instructions – all of h er rules first.  She then says, “Remember, don’t talk to strangers.”  A “stranger” is som eone that you don’t know, someone who you have never met before.  It’s very com mon, again, for young children to tell them not to talk to strangers.  P arents are afraid of what other adults might do with their children.  She says, “T here are predators out there who are looking to lure children away.”  A “pred ator” (predator) is a person who tries to chase or tries to hurt another person.  Usually here, when we’re talking about children, we’re talking about someone who  may be a sexual predator, so obviously this would be very dangerous, so Ms. Sanchez is telling them that they need to be careful.  Of course, you woul dn’t use the word “predator” with a young child; a good teacher would no t use that word since the children wouldn’t know what it meant.  Moreover, you p robably wouldn’t want to go into the reasons for children not talking to strang ers, at least not too much.

But Ms. Sanchez is not a great teacher, she says, “There are predators out there who are looking to children away.”  “To the lure” (lu re) means to get to someone to do something, especially if it’s bad or wrong, by makin g it seem fun and exciting.  Well, she’s warning against predators who try t o lure children – who get the children to leave their family and friends in orde r to abduct them.  “To abduct (someone)” means to kidnap them, to take someone away wh en he or she does not want to be taken away.  Ms. Sanchez says, “don’t let  your guard down.”  The expression “to let your guard down” means to stop being careful or cautious for a period of time.  She’s telling children do not let you r guard down, always be careful, don’t relax.

Ms. Sanchez, once again, gets a question from a student, b ut she says that she’ll take questions later and she continues talking.  She says to the children, “If you need to step away from the group, ask permission first.”  “To step away from” means to leave an area or a group of people and go in  another direction.  She tells the children to ask permission.  “Permission” is appr oval that someone gives you to do something; your boss, or your parent, or your t eacher may give you permission to do something; that is, they are saying it’s okay for you to do that. Ms. Sanchez says, “If a stranger tries to accost you or waylay you , run away as fast as you can.”  “To accost” (accost) means to walk up to so meone in a threatening way or an aggressive way, often to walk up t o someone because you

 want to hurt that person.  The person may try to accost o r waylay you.  “To waylay” (waylay) means to stop someone from going where h e or she had planned to go, usually by talking to that person or pe rhaps even attacking and hurting that person.  The instructions Ms. Sanchez gives is t hat the children should run away as fast as they can.

Finally, the student is able to ask Ms. Sanchez a question – or tell her something. The student says to Ms. Sanchez, “I think you’ve got the wro ng classroom (you’re in the wrong classroom).  We’re the eighth grad ers.  The first graders are on the second floor.”  An “eighth grader” is a group of students who are at a particular level in school; in this case at the eighth le vel, so they would be about 14-15 years old.  The “first graders” would be five or si x years old.  It’s obvious that the instructions that Ms. Sanchez is giving are for young children, not for a 14- or 15-year-old, so the student is telling Ms. Sanche z that she’s in the wrong class.

Ms. Sanchez asks, “Where are my glasses?”  She says, “Oh, here they are.  Oh! You’re not my first-graders!” realizing now she’s in the wrong place, “Why didn’t anyone say anything earlier?!”  Of course, someone did tr y to say something but she wouldn’t let the student talk!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ms. Sanchez:  Okay, kids.  I’m Ms. Sanchez, your substitute for this week.  I’m taking all of you on the field trip tomorrow.  Listen  up.  There are some ground rules we need to go over.  First, each of you will have a  partner and you will hold hands while we cross the streets.

[start of dialogue]  Britney:  I was thinking of hitting up Jane for a little loan.  You know her better than I do.  What are the chances she’ll spot me a couple hundred dollars until next month?  Salvador:  I think that’s a pipe dream.  I wouldn’t exactly call her a cheapskate, but she’s not known for her generosity.  Britney:  What about Francke?  He’s rolling in it.  He could easily part with a couple hundred bucks without giving it a second thought.  Salvador:  You’ve got your work cut out for you if you think you can borrow money from Francke.  He’s always been a penny-pincher and he always will be.    Britney:  Okay, then help me think.  Who do we know who isn’t stingy?  Who do we know who is big-hearted and charitable?  Salvador:  What the heck.  Here’s $150 to tide you over until your next payday.    Britney:  Wow, thanks!  You know, another $100 would really come in handy.  Salvador:  I really think you should quit while you’re ahead.  [end of dialogue] # Guarding One¡¦s Privacy

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 07: Guarding One’s Privacy.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 507.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  It contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes, and a complete transcript of this episode, of everything we say.

This episode is called “Guarding One’s Privacy.”  It’s a d ialogue between Dan and Mina talking about people who want to keep their  personal information private or secret.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I went to visit my old friend, Mina, whom I hadn’t see n in several years.  It was one of the strangest afternoons of my life!

Dan:  Hi, Mina, it’s really good to see you.

Mina:  Dan, come in.  Hurry!

Dan:  Uh, okay.  Why do you have four locks on your door, a nd why are all of the curtains drawn?

Mina:  I like my privacy.  And anyway, I think there’s a pee ping Tom around this apartment building and I don’t want him to get a pe ek into my apartment.

Dan:  Oh, okay.  I noticed that your name isn’t on your mailbox.  I wasn’t sure I had the right apartment number.

Mina:  Do you think I would voluntarily give people that  information?  They are constantly trying to invade my privacy.  All I want is anony mity, but I have to be on guard all of the time.  These days, I only give out p ersonal information on a need-to-know basis.

 Dan:  No offense, but isn’t that a little paranoid?  You act as though everybody is out to get you.

Mina:  Aren’t they?  Haven’t you noticed?  We constantly have to disclose our most personal information on forms and to anyone who com es to our door.  If I didn’t know you were coming today, I wouldn’t have opene d my door at all.

Dan:  You mean you live here in seclusion, like a hermit ?

Mina:  Of course not!  I have plenty of friends.  Come a nd meet them all.

Dan:  Wow, you must have 10 birds and 20 cats!

Mina:  Yes, that’s right.  But, rest assured, none of t hem will breathe a word of what you say here today!

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with Dan saying that he went to visit hi s old friend, Mina, whom he hadn’t seen in several years.  “It was one of the str angest afternoons of my life!” he says.

Dan says, “Hi, Mina, it’s really good to see you.”  Mina says, “Dan, come in. Hurry!”  Dan is obviously at Mina’s house, he knocks on her do or [sound of knocking], and she tells him to hurry up and come in.  D an says, “Uh, okay.  Why do you have four locks on your door, and why are all of the curtains drawn?”  A “lock” is something that you use to prevent other people f rom opening a door; Mina has four locks on her door.  She also has her curtai ns drawn.  “Curtains” are pieces of fabric that cover a window so you can’t see i nside.  “To be drawn” means, in this case, to be closed.  We use this word in t alking about curtains, sometimes we use the word “drapes.”  Curtains or drapes a re drawn when they are closed.  “Drawn,” however, has a couple of different  meanings in English, so be sure to look at the Learning Guide for this episode for some additional explanation of that.

Mina says, “I like my privacy.”  “Privacy” is the ability to be alone, to keep your personal information secret so that other people don’t  know about you or what you are doing.  Privacy has become very important, especial ly on the Internet. Mina says, “I think there’s a peeping Tom around this apa rtment building and I don’t want him to get a peek into my apartment.”  The  expression “a peeping Tom” refers to a person – a man, typically – who is looki ng through the windows trying to watch women, especially when women are taking their clothes off.  It’s,

 obviously, a very negative expression to use about someone; in  fact, you could probably get arrested by the police for being a peeping  Tom.  I’m not sure why the name Tom is used; I’m glad it isn’t a peeping Jeff!   Well, Mina says that she wants to make sure that this peeping doesn’t get a “pe ek” (peek) into her apartment.  “To peek at (something)” means to look quickl y at something, especially if it is difficult to see or if you’re not suppo sed to see it.  So, “taking a peek” means taking a quick look.

Dan says, “Oh, okay.  I noticed that your name isn’t on your  mailbox,” the small box where the mail carrier (the person from the, usuall y, government agency that delivers mail to your house) puts your mail; the mailbox is the place where the mail is put.  Mina, however, does not have her name on her mailbox; Dan says, “I wasn’t sure I had the right apartment number.”  Mina says, “Do you think I would voluntarily give people that information?”  “Voluntari ly” means willingly, when you want to do something.  She’s saying “I would not volunt arily (of my own free will) give people my information,” such as her name.  She says, “ They are constantly trying to invade my privacy.”  They – we’re not sure who t hey are – are trying to invade her privacy.  “To invade (someone’s) privacy” is to lea rn something about another person that they want to be secret, that they d on’t want to tell you.  If someone sends you a personal letter and your friend open s the letter and reads it without telling you or without you giving them perm ission, that would be an “invasion of privacy,” he would be invading your privacy.  “I nvasion” is the noun from the verb “to invade.”  Normally, this verb “to inva de” refers to an army going into another country.  The ancient Roman army invaded Gr eece back in the second century B.C., I believe.

Well, Mina doesn’t want anyone to invade her privacy, she  says, “All I want is anonymity, but I have to be on guard all the time.”  “ Anonymity” is to be anonymous; that is, to be in a situation where no one knows who you are or what you are doing.  “Anonymity” is a noun coming from the i dea of “anonymous,” which is unknown, so nobody knows about you.  She says, howeve r, that she has to be on guard all the time.  “To be on guard” i s an expression meaning to be very careful or cautious, to prevent something from happe ning; to be alert, this means to be on guard.  “Guard” has a couple of differe nt meanings in English however, so take a look at that Learning Guide for some more explanations.

She says, “These days, I only give out personal informatio n on a need-to-know basis.”  The expression “need-to-know basis” is used to descri be a situation where people are only given information that they absol utely must have, and only that very necessary information is shared or given to them .  It’s an expression you would probably hear in the government or in the mi litary, talking about secrets that the military has or that a country has.  It’s not normally used in daily

 conversation, but of course, Mina, here, is what we would  call a little bit “paranoid.”  She’s very worried that other people are going to hurt her or that other people are trying to follow her.  To be parano id is considered a negative description; it’s to be too worried, to be worried wit hout any good reason.

In fact, Dan says, “No offense (meaning I don’t want to  hurt you by saying this, by insulting you), but isn’t that a little paranoid?”  Da n says, “You act as though everyone is out to get you.”  “To be out to get (someone )” means to be trying to do something to somebody, usually something bad.  If you  say your boss is out to get you, you’re saying your boss is trying to hurt you or harm you in some way. There are actually two expressions here: “To be out to do (something)” means to try to do something; “to get (someone)” means to attack,  hurt, or perhaps even kill someone.  So to say someone “is out to get you” means that someone is trying to harm you.

Mina says, “Aren’t they?  Haven’t you noticed?  We constan tly have to disclose our most personal information on forms and to anyone w ho comes to our door.  If I didn’t know you were coming today, I wouldn’t have op ened my door at all.”  “To disclose” means to share or to give some secret or private i nformation to someone else.  So, Mina thinks that everyone is trying to i nvade her privacy by asking her for all this personal information.

Dan then says to Mina, “You mean you live here in seclusio n, like a hermit?”  “To be in seclusion” means to be alone, without talking to o ther people or seeing other people.  A “hermit” is a person who lives alone and doesn’t speak to anyone else.  This was originally a religious idea among  the early Christians. They were men who would go out into the desert by the mselves, and live by themselves, and spend the whole day praying.  That was to  be a hermit, to be alone.  Women, also, sometimes were hermits, and there  are, even today, people who are hermits for religious purposes.  But Da n, here, is talking about Mina being by herself, and so he’s using the term “hermi t” almost as an insult.

Mina says, “Of course not (of course I don’t live like a he rmit)!  I have plenty of friends.  Come and meet them all.”  Dan says, “Wow, you must have 10 birds and 20 cats!”  Her friends are animals.  Mina says, “Yes,  that’s right.  But, rest assured, none of them will breathe a word of what you say here today!”  The phrase “rest assured” means don’t worry; there is no probl em, there is no reason to worry.  She says none of these animals will breathe a word of what you say. “To breathe a word” is an expression that means to say some thing, especially to tell someone something that is personal, private, or secr et.  Of course, the animals won’t breathe a word; in fact, they can’t tal k, so it’s a pretty safe environment.  Obviously, Mina needs some help!

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

I went to visit my old friend, Mina, whom I hadn’t see n in several years.  It was one of the strangest afternoons of my life!

Dan:  Hi, Mina, it’s really good to see you.

Mina:  Dan, come in.  Hurry!

Dan:  Uh, okay.  Why do you have four locks on your door, a nd why are all of the curtains drawn?

Mina:  I like my privacy.  And anyway, I think there’s a pee ping Tom around this apartment building and I don’t want him to get a pe ek into my apartment.

Dan:  Oh, okay.  I noticed that your name isn’t on your mailbox.  I wasn’t sure I had the right apartment number.

Mina:  Do you think I would voluntarily give people that  information?  They are constantly trying to invade my privacy.  All I want is anony mity, but I have to be on guard all of the time.  These days, I only give out p ersonal information on a need-to-know basis.

Dan:  No offense, but isn’t that a little paranoid?  You act as though everybody is out to get you.

Mina:  Aren’t they?  Haven’t you noticed?  We constantly have to disclose our most personal information on forms and to anyone who com es to our door.  If I didn’t know you were coming today, I wouldn’t have opene d my door at all.

Dan:  You mean you live here in seclusion, like a hermit ?

Mina:  Of course not!  I have plenty of friends.  Come a nd meet them all.

Dan:  Wow, you must have 10 birds and 20 cats!

Mina:  Yes, that’s right.  But, rest assured, none of t hem will breathe a word of what you say here today!

# Regretting Past Actions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 08: Regretting Past Actions.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 508.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Regretting Past Actions.”  It’s a d ialogue between Dennis and Nora using vocabulary about being sorry for things tha t you did.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Dennis:  Oh, why did I let my temper get the best of me ?  I never should have said those things to the new client!

Nora:  Don’t freak out.  I’m sure you didn’t do any da mage that can’t be rectified. It’s true that, in retrospect, you probably shouldn’t ha ve called Nathan, the head of the project, a twerp.

Dennis:  Don’t remind me of what I said!  Hindsight is 20/20.  Now they’re going to think we’re running a dog and pony show.

Nora:  No, they’re not.  Nathan was being unreasonable  and you tried to sugarcoat your objections the best you could.  Everybody could  see that you were trying to pull your punches, but that guy just would n’t give an inch.

Dennis:  Nevertheless, this is going to have repercussions.

Nora:  Oh, here comes the boss now.  I think she wants to  talk to you.

Dennis:  I’ve no doubt about that.

Nora:  What do you suppose she’s going to say?

 Dennis:  I know exactly what she’s going to say: “Don’t let  the door hit you on the way out!”

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Dennis saying, “Oh, why did I let my temper get the best of me?”  Your “temper” is your anger.  To say “you l et your temper get the best of you” means that you got very angry, you lost control , you started saying and doing things that you would not normally do.  When  something “gets the best of you,” it defeats you somehow.  In this case, it means that your anger has defeated you in some way and caused you some problems.

Dennis says, “I never should have said those things to the ne w client!” the new customer, obviously talking about something at his job.  No ra says, “Don’t freak out.”  The verb “to freak (freak) out” is an informal t wo-word verb meaning to lose control of yourself, to panic, to get very worried.  “Fr eak” actually has a couple of different meanings in English; you can find more in thi s episode’s Learning Guide.

Nora says, “I’m sure you didn’t do any damage that can’t b e rectified.”  “To rectify (something)” is to fix something that is broken, to correct  something that is wrong, to repair something.  We often use this verb in  talking about problems that we’ve caused: “I’m going to rectify the situation,” I’m g oing to fix it; I’m going to make it better.  Nora says, “It’s true that, in retrospect , you probably shouldn’t have called Nathan, the head of the project, a twerp.”   “In retrospect” is an expression meaning looking back on something that has alre ady happened; looking at the past, especially when you wish that you woul d have done something differently.  Normally, when someone says “in re trospect,” they’re usually expressing some sort of regret, something they wish they did not do or wish they hadn’t done.

So, Nora is saying it was not a good idea for Dennis to call Nathan, who’s the leader of this project at his work, a twerp.  A “twerp”  (twerp) is an informal insulting word meaning someone who’s stupid, someone wh o you don’t like because they’re annoying or bothering you.  It’s a pretty strong insult; you certainly wouldn’t want to call anyone a twerp at your w ork.  Sometimes the word is used to imply that someone is too young to have sufficien t experience.

Dennis says, “Don’t remind me of what I said!  Hindsight is 20/20.”  “Hind” is “behind,” so “hindsight” means looking back.  When we say your vision – your sight (how well you can see) is “20/20,” that means that it’s perfect.  “Hindsight is 20/20” is an old expression meaning it’s always easy to see  what you did wrong

 or did right when you are looking at the past; it’s much  more difficult to know what to do in the future.  Dennis says, “Now they’re going to  think we’re running a dog and pony show.”  The expression “a dog and pony show” ref ers to a meeting or an event that is organized to impress other people but i sn’t really very important, doesn’t have a lot of depth.  “A dog and pony show” is o ften a somewhat negative way of describing someone going in and giving a presentation, for example, at another company.  A “pony” is a small type of horse that you might see, for example, in the circus.  It’s a small type of hors e that a child might ride, for example.

So Nora says, “No, they’re not (they’re not going to thi nk we are running a dog and pony show).  Nathan was being unreasonable and you  tried to sugarcoat your objections as best you could.”  Remember, Nathan is the guy that Dennis called a twerp.  “Nathan was being unreasonable and you  (Dennis) tried to sugarcoat your objections.”  “To sugarcoat (something)” mea ns to make something seem nicer than it really is, especially somethi ng that’s, perhaps, critical or negative.  “Sugar” is, of course, something t hat is sweet.  If you put sugar on top of something it may make it taste better – unless, of course, that something is, say, a steak or your eggs.  You shouldn’t put sugar on those – usually!  Dennis was trying to sugarcoat his objections.  You r “objections” are your differences of opinion, things that you have against  what someone else is saying.  “To sugarcoat your objections,” then, means to tr y to give your disagreements but do it in a nice way.

“Everybody could see,” Nora goes on, “that you were trying to pull your punches, but that guy just wouldn’t give an inch.”  “To pull your  punches” means not to use all of your abilities, not to do everything that you possi bly could.  The word “punch” has several different meanings: one meaning come s from boxing, where you take your fist  (your hand – your closed hand) and you t ry to hit the other person.  That’s called a “punch.”  “To pull your punches”  means not to hit the person as hard as you could.  In general, however, it m eans not to use all of your strength and ability.  For more meanings of the word “ punch,” take a look at today’s Learning Guide.  Nora says that Nathan, however, just wouldn’t give an inch.  The expression “to give an inch” is to compromise; t o change your idea, even a little bit.  You say one thing; I say something di fferent.  When one of us changes our opinion so that we can agree, we would give an inch – an inch, of course, being a very small amount.  But this guy wouldn’t give an inch; he wouldn’t compromise.

Dennis says, “Nevertheless, this is going to have repercussion s.”  Nevertheless (regardless; even though what you say what is true), this action (what he did by calling him a twerp) will have repercussions.  “Repercussion s” is just another

 word for consequences, usually negative consequences, somethi ng bad that happens because of something else.

Nora says, “Oh, here comes the boss now (meaning the boss is walking towards them).  I think she wants to talk to you.”  Dennis says, “I ’ve no doubt about that,” meaning I’m sure that’s true, she will want to talk to  me.  Nora says, “What do you suppose she’s going to say?” meaning what do you guess, what do you think she’s going to say.  “What do you suppose she’s going to sa y?”  Dennis says, “I know exactly what she’s going to say: ‘Don’t let the door hit you on the way out!’” This is an old expression; don’t let the door hit you on the way out while you’re leaving, in other words.  It’s a phrase used to mean tha t you want someone to leave immediately, usually because they have said something o r done something wrong.  It could mean because they’re fired – they’re lo sing their job, or that they just want that person to leave.  “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out!”  That’s what all my old girlfriends used to say to me!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Dennis:  Oh, why did I let my temper get the best of me ?  I never should have said those things to the new client!

Nora:  Don’t freak out.  I’m sure you didn’t do any da mage that can’t be rectified. It’s true that, in retrospect, you probably shouldn’t ha ve called Nathan, the head of the project, a twerp.

Dennis:  Don’t remind me of what I said!  Hindsight is 20/20.  Now they’re going to think we’re running a dog and pony show.

# Going on a Cruise

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 09: Going on a Cruise.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 509.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  The Learning Guide will help you improve your  English even faster, and make you just a little bit younger than you really are – try it, it works!

This episode is called “Going on a Cruise.”  It’s an epi sode that has a dialogue between Connie and Robert using vocabulary you would u se if you went on a big ship going on a vacation, which is what a cruise is.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Connie:  I’m so excited!  We’re finally taking a cruise.  Are you sure this is the embarkation area?

Robert:  Yes, I’m sure.  We go on board right here, se e?  Come on, let’s find our cabin.

Connie:  Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as possi ble and look around the entire ship.  Do you think they’ll let us go on the  bridge and meet the captain?

Robert:  I don’t think so.  You know, I think we’re go ing the wrong way.  I can’t find our cabin number.

Connie:  Let’s see if we can find the purser or a stewa rd to help us.  Oh, never mind, here it is!  Wow, this cabin is really small.

Robert:  No worries.  We won’t be spending much time i n the cabin.  When do we eat?

Connie:  We can go down to the buffet right now for lunch, and I put us down for the main seating at 7:00 for dinner.

Robert:  Whoa, what’s that?!

 Connie:  That’s the ship setting sail.  You’re not goin g to be seasick, are you?

Robert:  I don’t think so, but I’m really looking forwa rd to our first port of call!

[end of dialogue]

Connie begins our dialogue by saying, “I’m so excited!  We ’re finally taking a cruise,” a vacation where you eat, sleep and are enterta ined in a very large ship. Here in Los Angeles, you can take a cruise down to Mexico,  you can take a cruise up to Alaska, you can take a cruise to South America or to Hawaii; all of these are places where you can go on a cruise.  I’ve been on a cruise once, it was the worst experience of my life as a vacation.  But, he y, doesn’t mean you will have a bad time!  Connie says, “Are you sure this is the embarkation area?” “Embarkation” is when you get on the ship; it’s the pro cess of getting on the ship when you first get to the ship.  You park your car, or you get out of your taxi, and then you walk onto the ship; that’s the embarkation.

Robert says, “Yes, I’m sure.  We go on board right here , see?”  “To go on board” means to be on the ship, or it could mean on a boat, but here it means the big cruise ship.  Robert says, “Come on, let’s find our cabin. ”  Your “cabin” is your little room (and I do mean little room – small, very small) where you sleep.

Connie says, “Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as po ssible.”  “To go on deck” means to be on top of the ship.  It’s a large, fla t top of the ship.  There’s nothing above you in other words – there’s no roof, no  ceiling.  By the way, “cabin” has a couple of different meanings in English; t ake a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that word a nd our next word, which is “bridge.”  Connie says she wants to look around the entir e ship and asks, “Do you think they’ll let us go on the bridge and meet the captain?”  On a large ship, the “bridge” is the highest part of the ship, usually, w here people are, and these are the people who control the ship; they control its spe ed and direction.  That’s where you would find the captain.  So, the captain is o n the bridge; notice we don’t say “in the bridge,” we say “on the bridge.”  The  “captain” is, of course, the leader of the people who work on the ship – the person  who is in charge, who’s the boss.

Robert says, “I don’t think so,” I don’t think we can meet  the captain.  “You know,” he says, “I think we’re going the wrong way.  I can’t fin d our cabin number.” Connie says, “Let’s see if we can find the purser or a ste ward to help us.”  On a ship – on a cruise ship, the “purser” (purser) is the per son who works on the ship and whose job it is to help you have a good time and to  make you more comfortable.  Usually, the purser is assigned a certain num ber of cabins.  In other

 words, they’re responsible for everyone in, say, these 20 ca bins.  The “steward” is the person who brings food and drink to people in t heir cabins.  On American cruise ships, you usually can eat as much as you want; they have buffet lunches, dinners, and breakfast.  On many cruise ships you can also o rder food; you can have food delivered to your little room (your cabin) for free.  It’s not good food, but they definitely deliver it!

So Connie says, “Oh, never mind, here it is!” meaning s he’s found their cabin. “Never mind” means what I said before isn’t important o r is no longer important, don’t worry about it.  She doesn’t need to find the p urser and the steward in other words, because she found her cabin.  And what does she say when she sees her cabin?  “Wow, this cabin is really small.”  She should have  asked me, I could have told her!

Robert says, “No worries.”  The expression “no worries” ha s become popular a lot in the last 10-15 years in the United States.  It means no problem, there is nothing to worry about, or simply don’t worry about it.   Robert says, “We won’t be spending much time in the cabin (we won’t be here very much).  When do we eat?”  That’s a good question, because that’s pretty much  all you do on a cruise ship.  You eat and eat and eat, and watch other peopl e eat!

Connie says, “We can go down to the buffet right now for lunch.”  The “buffet” is, you may know, a style of eating where you have a long tab le and you put all the food on the table, and everyone comes and takes as much foo d as they want typically.  Connie says, “I put us down for the main seatin g at 7:00 for dinner.” Because there are so many people on a cruise ship, they assi gn you (or give you) a time when you can come and eat, if you are goin g to eat in the dinning room, in the main area where people eat.

Connie says she put her and her husband down for the mai n seating at 7:00 for dinner.  “To put them down” means to sign them up, od dly enough it means the same.  “To put us down” means to write our name down o r to say that’s when we want to do something.  Or if you’re volunteering for something, you would put your name on a list for example.  The expression “put me  down” can also used when, for example, someone is selling something to you an d you need to order it, and then they’ll go and get it.  You might use this exp ression, for example, if my niece is selling cookies for her Girl Scout troop (group of girls that get together and – I don’t know what they do).  Anyway, you would say p erhaps, “Put me down for three boxes of mints,” a type of chocolate cookie .  But here, Connie means that she simply signed them up, or wrote their nam e down, for the main seating.  “Seating,” here, means the time that you go into a restaurant and sit down to eat.  As I said before, on a cruise ship they have  different times –

 different seatings for each meal because there are too  many people on the ship for everyone to fit; there’s no room in the dining ro om for everyone at the same time.

Robert says, “Whoa, what’s that?!”  “Whoa” means I’m surp rised; I’m, perhaps, scared.  Connie says, “That’s the ship setting sail.”  “To set sail” is for a boat to leave the land and go out into the water.  Connie says,  “You’re not going to be seasick, are you?”  “To be seasick” is a type of motion sickness when you are on the water in a ship; you feel nauseous, your stomach doesn ’t feel good, you feel dizzy, and so forth.  Some people take special pills to pr event them from being seasick.  I got seasick when I went on a cruise, even though I took the pills.  So, doesn’t help me – but I’m sure you’ll have a good time !

Robert says, “I don’t think so (I don’t think I’m getting  seasick), but,” he says, “I’m really looking forward to our first port of call!”  You r “port of call” is a place where the cruise ship stops, usually for a short period, but it could be overnight or more. It allows you to get off the ship and to visit the place where it is stopped, and then you go back on the ship, and then you go somewhere else.  If you take a cruise ship around the Mediterranean, the sea between Africa and Europe, you could go to many different ports of call – many different pla ces you could stop and visit.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Connie:  I’m so excited!  We’re finally taking a cruise.  Are you sure this is the embarkation area?

Robert:  Yes, I’m sure.  We go on board right here, se e?  Come on, let’s find our cabin.

Connie:  Okay, but I want to go up on deck as soon as possi ble and look around the entire ship.  Do you think they’ll let us go up on the bridge and meet the captain?

Robert:  I don’t think so.  You know, I think we’re go ing the wrong way.  I can’t find our cabin number.

Connie:  Let’s see if we can find the purser or a stewa rd to help us.  Oh, never mind, here it is!  Wow, this cabin is really small.

 Robert:  No worries.  We won’t be spending much time i n the cabin.  When do we eat?

Connie:  We can go down to the buffet right now for lunch, and I put us down for the main seating at 7:00 for dinner.

Robert:  Whoa, what’s that?!

Connie:  That’s the ship setting sail.  You’re not goin g to be seasick, are you?

Robert:  I don’t think so, but I’m really looking forwa rd to our first port of call!

# Taking a Shower or Bath

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 10: Taking a Shower or Bath.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 510.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a story about someone taking a shower or a bath.  When your body is dirty, you have to clean it, and that’s what we’r e going to do in this episode.  Let’s get started. > I spent the day helping my friend, Babbit, on his farm.   When I got home, my wife said, “You stink!”  I headed straight for the shower.
> I ran the water, closed the shower curtain, and adjusted  the showerhead.  I worked the soap into a lather and scrubbed from head to  toe.  I rinsed off the soap and toweled off.
> When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Yo u still stink!  You need to soak in a bath!”
> I went back into the bathroom, put the stopper in the bathtub, and turned on the faucet.  I didn’t want to take any chances.  I took some of  my wife’s bubble bath and poured it into the bathtub.  When the bath was r eady, I got in.  I soaked for a half hour and I washed every nook and cranny.
> When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Wo w, you smell as pretty as a flower!”  That wasn’t exactly what I was going for, but I’d rather smell like flowers than pigs!

 Our story begins with me saying that I spent the day help ing my friend, Babbit, on his farm.  A “farm” is a place where you may have animals,  you may be growing food in the ground; it’s a place outside of the city, u sually.  When I got home, my wife said, “You stink!”  The verb “to stink” is an inform al way of saying that someone smells bad, they have an unpleasant smell or an unpleasant odor. “Odor” (odor) is the same as smell.  So, when someone d oesn’t smell very good because they’re dirty, you could say, “You stink.”  However, it’s a very strong thing to say; it’s a very negative thing to say, so you woul d not want to say that to anyone that you didn’t know very well.  We also use the v erb “to stink” to mean to be poor at something, to not be very good at something .  I could say, “I stink at chess,” meaning I’m not a very good chess player.

But in this case, when my wife says that I stink, she means I  smell bad, so I headed straight for the shower.  “To head for (somethi ng)” is to go in the direction of.  When I say I headed straight for the shower, I me an I went directly to the shower; I didn’t do anything else first.  That’s the mea ning of the word “straight” here.  A “shower” is the part of the bathroom where you stand under water to get clean; you stand up and the water goes over you to clean you.  I say that I ran the water.  “To run the water” means to turn the wa ter on and, usually, wait until the water gets warm enough.  So, “to run the water” means to turn the water on. I ran the water, and then I closed the shower curtain.   The “shower curtain” is a large piece of plastic that hangs around the shower, sepa rates the shower from the rest of the bathroom to prevent the water from g oing outside.  Some showers have doors, and you slide the door back and forth, often  made of glass.  Other showers have a shower curtain.  A curtain is also a word w e use to describe things that you put over your windows to keep the light  out; those are also curtains, when they’re made of some kind of material – so me kind of fabric.  I also adjusted the showerhead.  The “showerhead” is the piece of metal that the water comes out of in a shower.  It’s attached to a pipe  in the wall where the water comes from, and it’s what sprays the water over you –  that is, it distributes the water over you.  That’s the showerhead.

I said that I worked the soap into a lather.  “To work the soap” means I did something to the soap; in this case, I put the soap on my skin and I moved it back and forth – I rubbed it until it was in the form of lather.  “Lather” (lather) is when you have a lot of soap bubbles on your skin so that i t looks white.  Or for example, you could put soap on your hands, and if you move them together very quickly you will work the soap into a lather.

I “scrubbed” (meaning I rubbed very hard in order to ge t clean) from head to toe. The expression “from head to toe” means from the top of  your body where your head is to the bottom of your body where your foot and toe are.  Your toes, of

 course, are the five little digits that come out of your  foot.  Then, I rinsed off the soap and toweled off.  “To rinse (something)” means to pour water on it to, usually, get rid of the soap that you are using to clean something.  “To rinse off” means the same; we use “off” here for emphasis.  It’s very common in English to add a preposition like “off” after a verb to give it the idea of motion – of action.  In this case, to rinse off means to put the water on me so t hat the soap (that solid or liquid substance that you use to clean something) goes of f of my body.  So, I rinsed off the soap and I toweled off.  “To towel off ” means to take something to dry your body, what we call a “towel,” which is a big pi ece of fabric – of material that you use to dry something with.  “To towel off” is the same as “to dry off,” to take something and remove water from something else; in this case, from my body.

When I went back into the living room after showering, my wife said, “You still stink!”  In other words, I did not get rid of all of t he bad smell.  She says, “You need to soak in a bath!”  “To soak” (soak), here, mean s to be covered in water for a long period of time, usually we do that to make some thing easier to clean.  So if you are cooking and you have a pan that is very dirty, you m ay put water on it – or water in it and let the pan soak – use the water to  help make the pan easier to clean.  So maybe an hour later, you would come back and t hen clean the pan. Well here, we’re talking about soaking your body because it’s so dirty, and so you get into what we call a “bathtub,” which is a larg e, usually rectangular container in the bathroom that you can sit in or lie d own in and put water over you.

I went back into the bathroom then and put the stopper  in the bathtub.  The “stopper” is a small piece of metal or plastic that you p ut in the hole that is at the bottom of the bathtub or of a sink so that water can’t flow out; the water stays in the bathtub or the sink.  If you want to take a bath, yo u have to put a stopper there so that you have water inside the bathtub.  I tur ned on the faucet after that. The “faucet” (faucet) is a long, metal piece that is a bove the sink or bathtub that the water comes out of.  So, “to turn on the faucet” means to allow the water to come out and fill up the bathtub.  I said, “I didn’t want to take any chances,” I wanted to be sure I was going to be clean.  So, I took some of my wife’s bubble bath and poured it into the bathtub.  “Bubble bath”  is a liquid that smells nice that women sometimes, or children, put in their bath to make  them smell nice.  It’s not something that a man would normally do, but because I w as so dirty I wanted to make sure I smelled good.

When the bath was ready, then I got in.  I soaked for a  half hour and I washed every nook and cranny.  The expression “nook (nook) and cra nny (cranny)” means small places, but here, when we say “I washed every no ok and cranny,”

 we mean you did a hundred percent of everything; you clea ned everything.  You might say, “I was looking for my car keys, because I lost them .  I looked in every nook and cranny of my house,” meaning I looked everywhere.   So here, we’re saying that I cleaned every part of my body.

When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Wo w, you smell as pretty as a flower!”  I say that that wasn’t exactly what I was go ing for.  “To go for,” in this case, means what I wanted, what I intended, what I  was trying to make happen.  I wasn’t trying to smell pretty, I was just trying not to smell bad.  “To go” plus a preposition is a very common expression in English; ta ke a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations of that, as w ell as the verb – or the word “soak.”  I said, “I’d rather smell like flowers tha n pigs!”  Remember, I was working on a farm, and so one of the animals that you h ave on a farm is a pig, which people think tends to smell badly.

Now that I’m all clean and smelling like a flower, let ’s listen to the dialogue again at a normal speed. > I spent the day helping my friend, Babbit, on his farm.   When I got home, my wife said, “You stink!”  I headed straight for the shower.
> I ran the water, closed the shower curtain, and adjusted  the showerhead.  I worked the soap into a lather and scrubbed from head to  toe.  I rinsed off the soap and toweled off.
> When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Yo u still stink!  You need to soak in a bath!”
> I went back into the bathroom, put the stopper in the bathtub, and turned on the faucet.  I didn’t want to take any chances.  I took some of  my wife’s bubble bath and poured it into the bathtub.  When the bath was r eady, I got in.  I soaked for a half hour and I washed every nook and cranny.
> When I went back into the living room, my wife said, “Wo w, you smell as pretty as a flower!”  That wasn’t exactly what I was going for, but I’d rather smell like flowers than pigs!

# Getting Plastic Surgery

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 11: Getting Plastic Surgery.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 511.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

If you go to our website, eslpod.com, you can download a  Learning Guide for this episode, an to 8- to 10-page guide that contains our vo cabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes,  comprehension questions, and, most importantly, a complete transcript of  everything we say on this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between George and Joan abou t “plastic surgery,” when people have medical procedures (surgeries) on their  body to change the way it looks.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

George:  What are you doing?

Joan:  I’m looking through these magazines to try and deci de which plastic surgery procedures I should have next year.

George:  You’re not thinking of going under the knife .

Joan:  Yes, I am.  I’ve always wanted to improve on the w ay I look, and I’m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.  I want to look 25 ag ain!

George:  That’s ridiculous.  Nobody who is 45 can look 25.   People who get Botox, have facelifts, or tummy tucks look weird.

Joan:  That’s because they didn’t go to the best plastic sur geons.  I won’t make that mistake.  Help me decide.  Should I get liposuction  and a nose job, or should I go all out and get breast implants, too?

George:  I think you’ve gone off the deep end.  We’ve b een friends for over 20 years and you don’t need any cosmetic surgery.  You’re perf ect the way you are.

Joan:  You can’t be serious!

 George:  I’m dead serious, and if you get all of that plastic surgery, you’ll look like an over-the-hill Barbie doll, and I’m not going to b e seen in public with you.

Joan:  What’s wrong with a little plastic surgery?  I ju st want to feel better about myself.

George:  You don’t need plastic surgery to do that.  Yo u just need to spend more time with me and your other friends who like you just t he way you are!

Joan:  Sagging skin and all?

George:  What sagging skin?

Joan:  I feel younger already.

[end of dialogue]

The dialogue begins with George saying to Joan, “What  are you doing?”  Joan says, “I’m looking through these magazines to try and decid e which plastic surgery procedures I should have next year.”  “Plastic surger y,” sometimes called “cosmetic surgery,” is one of many different medical procedu res that involve cutting into your skin, usually to make you more attractive or more beautiful.  If you think your nose is too big, you may have plastic surgery to  make your nose smaller.  My wife thinks my mouth is too big, so she wants me to have plastic surgery to make it smaller!

Joan is interested in plastic surgery, which is very popular especially in cities like Los Angeles where everyone is trying to look beautiful, es pecially those who are on television or the movies.  I, of course, am on a podcas t, so you can guess how ugly I am!

George says, “You’re not going under the knife.”  The expression “to go under the knife” means to have surgery; not plastic surgery exclu sively, it could be any kind of surgery.  If you had a car accident you might have t o have surgery, where the doctor cuts open your body.  That’s going under the kn ife.  Plastic surgery is just one type of surgery.

Joan says, “Yes, I am.  I’ve always wanted to improve on the  way I look (to make myself look better), and I’m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.”  “Wrinkles” are small lines (or folds, we might call them) in your skin, usually caused by age. As you get older, you have more wrinkles.  They may also be caused by sun

 damage.  People who like to go out into the sun and get a tan so they look younger, well, the problem is later in life then you h ave even more wrinkles and you look even older.  “Sagging skin” is skin that hangs down ; it is not as tight as it used to be.  It would be, for example, loose skin on you r face, rather than having your skin that was tight, as you would see among younger pe ople.  Not me, people who are really young!  The word “sag” (sag) has se veral different meanings in English; take a look at that Learning Guide  for some additional explanations.

Joan says, “I want to look 25 again.”  George says, “That’s ridiculous.  Nobody who is 45 can look 25.”  That’s true; I’m 45 and I will  never look 25.  In fact, even when I was 25, I didn’t look 25!  George says, “People w ho get Botox, have facelifts, or tummy tucks look weird (look strange).”  “Boto x” (Botox) is a chemical substance that is injected or put into your skin on your face  so that you have fewer wrinkles.  It makes your skin smoother.  It also make s your skin unable to move so that when you smile or try to have some expression  on your face, your skin just stays the way it is; it doesn’t move.  It looks very str ange.  It’s very popular among a lot of people here in Hollywood; the y get Botox, especially women, but not just women.  “To have a facelift” (one word) is to remove lose skin on your face, making it tighter.  The idea is to try to make you look younger. A “tummy tuck” is a surgical procedure that cuts away fat an d skin from your abdomen – from what we call your tummy, which is in the middle part of your body.  The idea of a tummy tuck is to make you look thinner .

Joan says that people who get Botox, have facelifts, or tu mmy tucks look weird because they don’t go to the best plastic surgeons.  A “surg eon” is someone who does surgery.  A “plastic surgeon” is a medical doctor who d oes surgeries that make people look better or younger.  Joan says, “I won’t make that mistake (I won’t go to any thing but the best plastic surgeons).”  I f you ever are in Los Angeles and you pick up one of the weekly entertainment m agazines or newspapers, which are often distributed for free at cof fee shops and restaurants, you can open up the newspaper or magazine and you can see advertisements from doctors who are plastic surgeons.  It’s sort of funny;  they’re so popular here in Los Angeles that they advertise in the newspaper.  Us ually, the advertisement has a beautiful woman in a bikini who has a very – how should we say – large top of her body and a very small bottom of her body, o bviously the result of plastic surgery.

Joan says, “Help me decide (meaning help me make a decision  George). Should I get liposuction and a nose job, or should I g o all out and get breast implants?”  “Liposuction” is a type of plastic surgery tha t removes unwanted fat from your belly – your abdomen, your tummy.  It pulls the  fat out of your body so

 that you look less fat.  The “nose job” is when you get su rgery to make your nose smaller or to make it have a different shape.  The exp ression “to go all out” means to do 100 percent of something, to do everything  possible, to go to the extreme, to try very hard to do something.  These are al l meanings of “to go all out.”  “They’re going to go all out on their wedding ,” they’re going to invite 500 people and spend 50,000 dollars – they’re going to go all out.  “To go out” has several different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that phrasal verb.

So, Joan is wondering if she should go all out and get  breast implants.  “To implant (something)” is to put something underneath y our skin or in your body. “Breast implants,” for women usually, are when the woma n’s breasts (her chest; the top front of her body) are changed, usually made  bigger by putting in little bags of a type of plastic – of silicone.  When I was talkin g about the advertisements for the plastic surgeons in the newspapers i n Los Angeles, well, usually those are of women in bikinis who have breast imp lants.

George says to Joan, “I think you’ve gone off the deep en d.”  “To go off the deep end” means to go crazy, to stop being realistic.  George says, “We’ve been friends for over 20 years and you don’t need any cosmetic sur gery.”  Remember, cosmetics surgery is the same as plastic surgery.  “You’re perf ect the way you are.”  Joan says, “You can’t be serious (meaning you’re kid ding, right?)!”

George says, “I’m dead serious.”  When someone says they’r e “dead serious,” they’re saying they’re very serious, they’re extremely serious, they’re not joking at all.  George says, “if you get all of that plastic surg ery, you’ll look like an over- the-hill Barbie doll.”  There’s two expressions there: f irst, “over the hill” means old; it’s an informal expression, somewhat of a negative expression.  If somebody says, “You’re over the hill,” they mean that you have alre ady gotten to the top of your life, and now you’re on the second part of your lif e.  You’re old, in other words.  That’s what my nieces and nephews tell me, I’m ov er the hill: “You’re over the hill Uncle Jeff!”  A “Barbie doll” is a child’ s toy, usually a young girl’s toy. It’s a small doll that has, usually, blonde hair.  It’s b een around for several years, since probably the middle part of the 20th century.  They’re very popular.  Usually they are dolls that are very beautiful women with larg e breasts and a small waist – a small bottom.  George says, “I’m not going to be see n in public with you.”

Joan says, “What’s wrong with a little plastic surgery?  I just want to feel better about myself.”  And, of course, that’s one unfortunate reason why some women have plastic surgery, I think.  George says, “You don’t need  plastic surgery to (feel better about yourself).  You just need to spend m ore time with me and your other friends who like you just the way you are!”  Joan sa ys, “Sagging skin and

 all?”  The phrase “and all” is used to emphasize that som ething is included in the discussion.  It would be another way of “even my sagging skin .”  George says, “What sagging skin?”  Joan says, “I feel younger already,” meaning telling me that makes me feel younger.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

George:  What are you doing?

Joan:  I’m looking through these magazines to try and deci de which plastic surgery procedures I should have next year.

George:  You’re not thinking of going under the knife .

Joan:  Yes, I am.  I’ve always wanted to improve on the w ay I look, and I’m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.  I want to look 25 ag ain!

George:  That’s ridiculous.  Nobody who is 45 can look 25.   People who get Botox, have facelifts, or tummy tucks look weird.

Joan:  That’s because they didn’t go to the best plastic sur geons.  I won’t make that mistake.  Help me decide.  Should I get liposuction  and a nose job, or should I go all out and get breast implants, too?

# Changing the Subject in Conversation

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 12: Changing the Subject in Conversation.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 512.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Laura and Gaius talki ng about common expressions and phrases we use to change the subject (the to pic) of our conversations.  A very useful episode, I think you will find .  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Laura:  I think that’s all we need to talk about regar ding last month’s report.  Let’s turn to this month’s report, shall we?  I didn’t get a copy of it.  Could someone hand me one?

Gaius:  By the way, I have just one last comment before we shift our focus to this month’s report.  It seems to me that we need more info rmation on how the Duluth office is doing.  Could we ask for more info to be inclu ded in next month’s report?

Laura:  I’m sure we can.  Incidentally, Dee is quitting and Kara will be taking her place.  This is off the record, of course.  Okay, now back t o this month’s report…

Gaius:  Speaking of personnel changes, did you know that  Lee is being promoted to V.P. next month?

Laura:  I hadn’t heard that, but I’m not surprised.   She’s been in line for that job for years.  Okay, we need to get back to this month’s repo rt…

Gaius:  Something just occurred to me.  If Lee is being  promoted, what will happen to the Baseship project?

Laura:  I think it’s being put on the back burner for n ow.  All right, could someone hand me a copy of this month’s report?

 Gaius:  I don’t mean to change the subject but…

Laura:  I think that’s precisely what you’re trying to do.   What’s the matter with this month’s report?

Gaius:  It’s not quite finished.  It’ll be on your de sk this afternoon.

Laura:  Is that what this tap dance has been about?  A ll right, we’ll talk about it at tomorrow’s meeting.  Next time, just give it to me strai ght, okay?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Laura saying that she thinks th at’s all they need to talk about regarding last month’s report.  We’re obviously he re in a business meeting, and Laura is the boss.  She’s telling Gaius that they don ’t need to talk about the report on what was done last month.  Instead, she wants to talk about this month’s report, so she says, “Let’s turn to this month’s re port, shall we?”  “To turn to (something)” is one of the many expressions we’ll discuss i n this dialogue used to change the subject of a conversation.  It means let ’s begin talking about something else, let’s begin to focus on something differ ent.  It’s somewhat of a formal expression that might be used by someone who is r unning a meeting, who is leading a group in a discussion.  Laura says, “Let’s tur n to this month’s report, shall we?”  “Shall we” is a formal phrase inviting some one to join you in doing what you are doing.  “Shall we dance?” means do you wan t to dance with me. No?  Okay.  Then you go to the next girl, you see.  That  was always my strategy!

Laura says that she didn’t get a copy of this month’s repo rt, and asks if someone could hand her one.  “To hand (someone) (something)” m eans to give something to someone.  It’s a polite way of saying “please could you  give me this thing,” or “pass me this thing.”  “Could you hand me that pen, ple ase?” means could you give me that pen, take it and put it into my hand.  “H and” has several different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Gaius says, “By the way, I have just one last comment before  we shift our focus to this month’s report.”  “By the way” is a phrase used to  say that you want to continue talking about something but add a slightly diff erent topic, so it’s not a completely new subject.  If you say, “Let’s turn to the Ba seship project,” well, you’re saying I want to talk about something completely n ew, usually.  But if you say “by the way,” you mean that you have something additio nal to say about the topic you’re talking about now, but slightly different t han what you were just

 talking about.  So, Gaius says, “By the way, I have just on e last comment before we shift our focus to this month’s report.”  “To shift (sh ift) your focus” means to begin discussing a new or different topic; it’s similar t o “to turn to.”  Gaius says, “It seems to me that we need more information on how the Duluth office is doing.” Duluth is a city in northern Minnesota.  Gaius says, “Could  we ask for more info (meaning information) to be included in next month’s r eport?”

Laura says, “I’m sure we can.  Incidentally, Dee is quitt ing and Kara will be taking her place.”  “Incidentally” (or, if it’s pronounced mo re carefully, “incidentally”) means that you want to add some additional information  about the topic that you were just discussing – usually that’s what it means.  Laura says that Dee is quitting and Kara will be taking her place.  Perhaps D ee and Kara both work in the Duluth office, so this is an additional piece of in formation related to the topic they were just discussing.  Then she says, “This is off the r ecord, of course.”  “Off the record” means unofficially.  It’s a phrase that you use  to tell people that the information you are giving them is secret.  It’s usually use d by government officials or other people who are being interviewed, f or example, by a newspaper reporter, and they don’t want something “on the record ,” meaning they don’t want something to be recorded – something to be written do wn.  That’s what “the record” is here; it’s an account of something; it’s a story or details about something.  So, “off the record” would mean I don’t want you to write this down or I don’t want you to tell anyone else I’m telling you.

Laura says, “Okay, now back to this month’s report…”  Gaius, however, says, “Speaking of personnel changes, did you know that Lee is b eing promoted to V.P. next month?”  “Speaking of” is a phrase used to show  that you want to add more information that is related to the topic just me ntioned.  Once again, it’s another way of changing the topic of the conversation, b ut what you’re really doing here is linking – connecting the information you’r e about to say with information that was just discussed.  So for example if I’m talking about going to New York City on a vacation and my friend has a relative,  someone who is part of his family that lives in New York, after I tell him my story, he may say to me, “Speaking of New York, I have an uncle who lives there, yo u know.”  So he’s connecting his topic to my topic.  Gaius says, “Speaking of p ersonnel changes (personnel refers to the people who work for a company) , did you know that Lee is being promoted to V.P. next month?”  “To be promot ed” means to get a better job, a job with more responsibility, a job that is hig her up in the company.

Laura then says, “I hadn’t heard that, but I’m not surp rised.  She (meaning Lee) has been in line for that job for years.  “To be in li ne for” means that you are the next person who will get something, you will be the ne xt person to receive something, or you are ready for something to happen.  Many people think

 California is in line for another major earthquake.  We’re in line for – we’re waiting for it to happen, it will happen.  We’re next, in ot her words.

Laura says, “Okay, we need to get back to this month’s repo rt…”  But Gaius doesn’t want to talk about this month’s report, He says, “ Something just occurred to me (meaning I just thought of something).  If Lee is being promoted, what will happen to the Baseship project (the name of a project they’re working on in their company)?”  Laura says, “I think it’s being put on the ba ck burner for now.”  “To put (something) on the back burner” means to delay someth ing or to stop focusing on something temporarily because it isn’t that important – it isn’t that urgent.  Laura is saying that that project will probabl y be delayed.  Then she says, “All right, could someone hand me a copy of this mont h’s report?” Remember, she asked for someone to give her a copy of the report at the beginning of the conversation.

Gaius says, “I don’t mean to change the subject but…”  “To  change the subject” means to changed topics, to stop discussing one thing and b egin discussing something else.  Laura interrupts him and says, “I think that’s precisely what you’re doing,” meaning you’re trying to change the subj ect so that we don’t talk about this month’s report.  “Precisely,” here, means exact ly – that’s exactly what you’re doing.  “What’s the matter with this month’s rep ort?” she finally asks. “What’s the matter with” means what’s wrong with.  It’ s something people use when something isn’t working correctly or isn’t behaving no rmally.  You could say it about a person: “What’s wrong with your brother?” –  he seems angry, why? Or, it could be something you use to talk about a machin e: “What’s wrong with my computer?  It stopped working.”  Oh, I poured water on it; well, okay, that’s why it stopped working!

Gaius says, “It’s not quite finished (meaning this month’ s report isn’t finished, he didn’t complete it).  It will be on your desk this after noon,” meaning I will give it to you this afternoon.  Laura then says, “Is that what this t ap dance has been all about?”  “Tap dance” normally is a kind of dance where so meone has special pieces of metal on their shoes – on the bottom of their  shoes that make noise. But the expression here means that someone is trying to av oid talking about or avoid doing something by talking about something else.  “I tap danced around the subject” – I didn’t want to talk about it so I talke d about other things.  It’s a negative expression in the sense that the person isn’t bei ng direct, they aren’t going right to the truth.  They’re trying to distract yo u by talking about other things, perhaps.  Laura says, “Next time, just give it to m e straight.”  This is the opposite of giving someone a tap dance.  “To give it to (someone) straight” means to tell the full truth, very directly, right away.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Laura:  I think that’s all we need to talk about regar ding last month’s report.  Let’s turn to this month’s report, shall we?  I didn’t get a copy of it.  Could someone hand me one?

Gaius:  By the way, I have just one last comment before we shift our focus to this month’s report.  It seems to me that we need more info rmation on how the Duluth office is doing.  Could we ask for more info to be inclu ded in next month’s report?

Laura:  I’m sure we can.  Incidentally, Dee is quitting and Kara will be taking her place.  This is off the record, of course.  Okay, now back t o this month’s report…

Gaius:  Speaking of personnel changes, did you know that  Lee is being promoted to V.P. next month?

Laura:  I hadn’t heard that, but I’m not surprised.   She’s been in line for that job for years.  Okay, we need to get back to this month’s repo rt…

Gaius:  Something just occurred to me.  If Lee is being  promoted, what will happen to the Baseship project?

Laura:  I think it’s being put on the back burner for n ow.  All right, could someone hand me a copy of this month’s report?

Gaius:  I don’t mean to change the subject but…

Laura:  I think that’s precisely what you’re trying to do.   What’s the matter with this month’s report?

Gaius:  It’s not quite finished.  It’ll be on your de sk this afternoon.

Laura:  Is that what this tap dance has been about?  A ll right, we’ll talk about it at tomorrow’s meeting.  Next time, just give it to me strai ght, okay?

# Snooping and Eavesdropping

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 13: Snooping and Eavesdropping.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 513.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes, and, would you believe it, a complete transcript of everything we say on this episode.

This episode is called “Snooping and Eavesdropping.”  The se are different ways of gathering or collecting information secretly, sometim es illegally.  We’ll listen to a conversation Enrique and Stella, who are trying to g et information about Stella’s boyfriend.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Enrique:  I don’t know how you talked me into coming wi th you to Dan’s apartment to rifle through his papers.  This snooping i s stupid!  If you have suspicions, you should just talk to him.

Stella:  Confront him without any evidence?  That woul d be the height of stupidity.

Enrique:  Instead, we’re holed up in this closet until he leaves.  I thought you said he wouldn’t be home until 6:00.

Stella:  That’s what I thought.  Just sit tight.  I thi nk he just came home to pick something up.  He’ll be gone in a minute.

Enrique:  I don’t like confined spaces.  If we don’t make  a break for it soon, I’m going to suffocate.

Stella:  Stop your kvetching.  Now that we’re here, ma ybe we can do better than looking through his papers.  We can eavesdrop on his conver sations.

Enrique:  Have you lost your mind?  Do you know what he  would do to us if he found us here?

 Stella:  No guts, no glory!

[end of dialogue]

Enrique and Stella are inside of Dan’s apartment.  In  fact, they’re inside one of the closets of Dan’s apartment, the small space you use usu ally to put clothing or other things.  Dan has come home unexpectedly while Enri que and Stella were there trying to find information about him.

Enrique says, “I don’t know how you talked me into coming  with you to Dan’s apartment.”  “To talk (someone) into (something)” is t o get another person to agree to do something that they don’t really want to d o, and usually we use this expression when you discover later that it was a mistake, th at you should have said no.  “I don’t know how you talked me into buying t his car, it’s too expensive” – I should not have listened to you.  The verb “to talk”  has several different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for this ep isode for some more explanations.

Enrique says that he doesn’t know how Stella talked him i nto coming with her to Dan’s apartment to rifle through his papers.  “To rifl e through (something)” means to look through something quickly, usually to steal it, usually for reasons that are not good.  Someone who’s looking for something who wan ts to steal something may rifle through your desk – the papers on your desk in o rder to find that something.  Enrique says, “This snooping is stupid!”  “To snoop” (snoop) means to spy, to look at things that you shouldn’t be looking a t or that don’t belong to you, usually things that contain some sort of secret infor mation.  Enrique says, “If you have suspicions, you should just talk to him.”  A “suspi cion” is a thought or a feeling that something is wrong.  You don’t have any pr oof, you don’t have any evidence, but you have a suspicion – you think that somethin g might be wrong.

Stella says, “Confront him without any evidence?”  “To con front (someone)” means to talk to someone or deal with something that is difficult or unpleasant, usually to talk to another person about a very difficult t opic.  Stella says, asking Enrique, “Confront him without any evidence?  That wou ld be the height of stupidity.”  “Stupidity” is a noun for things that are st upid or foolish.  The expression “the height of stupidity” means this would be  extremely stupid, very stupid.  We use this expression sometimes, “the height of”  followed by some noun, usually when we’re expressing something negative tha t has happened, something very bad.  For example: “That is the height of arrogance to tell the President of the United States that he should cut his ha ir.”  It’s the height of

 arrogance – it’s the very extreme example, the highest ex ample of that particular quality.

Enrique says, “Instead (instead of confronting Dan direct ly), we’re holed up in this closet until he leaves.”  “To be holed up (somewhere)” m eans to be trapped in a small space and you can’t get out.  You’re stuck; you can’t leave.  If you go skiing and suddenly there’s a lot of snow and you can’t leave you r hotel, you could be holed up in your hotel.  Sometimes we use this expression  when someone voluntarily goes somewhere that they don’t want to leave,  to be separated from other people.  But here, Enrique is using it to mean that they are in a small space, a closet, and they can’t leave.  They can’t leave bec ause they’re in Dan’s apartment, and Dan doesn’t know that they are there.

Stella tells Enrique to sit tight.  “To sit tight” mea ns to be patient and don’t move, don’t go anywhere else.  “I think Dan just came home to pick up something up (or to pick something up – it means the same).  He’ll be gon e (he’ll leave) in a minute.”  Enrique says, “I don’t like confined spaces.”  “Confined” means you don’t have a lot of room, you can’t move easily.  “Confin ed” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Enrique says that he doesn’t like confined spaces – confine d places.  “If we don’t make a break for it soon,” he says, “I’m going to suffocate .”  “To make a break for it” means to escape, to leave a place where you are tra pped or that you’re not supposed to leave.  A prisoner may try to make a break for  it, meaning try to escape from the prison.  Enrique says if they don’t make a break for it soon (if they don’t leave – escape out of this closet), he’s going to suffocate.  “To suffocate” means to die because you can’t breathe.  Someon e may be preventing you from breathing by covering your mouth, or  maybe there just isn’t enough oxygen in the air; that could also cause you to  suffocate – to die because you can’t breathe.

Stella says to Enrique, “Stop your kvetching.”  “To kvetch” is an informal expression meaning to complain loudly and repeatedly.  So meone who’s always complaining, “Oh, it’s so hot in here.  Oh, why can’t w e get a better air conditioner (etc., etc.),” this is someone who likes to kvetch .  The word “kvetch” is a Yiddish word, a language spoken by primarily Jewish imm igrants to the United States.  There are several Yiddish words that have become part of the general English language, at least American English.

Stella says to Enrique, “Stop your kvetching.  Now that we’re here, maybe we can do better than looking through his papers.  We can e avesdrop on his

 conversations.”  “To eavesdrop” means to listen to something  that you’re not supposed to hear, to secretly listen to someone else’s conversa tion.  If someone is in a restaurant sitting next to you in the next table , and you’re not supposed be listening to their conversation but you are, that would  be to eavesdrop.  Often people eavesdrop in order to get information – to ge t secret information.

Enrique says, “Have you lost your mind?”  “To lose your mind ” means to go crazy, to do something very strange or even illogical.  He sa ys, “Do you know what he would do to us if he found us here?”  “Do you know what he would do to us?” – do you know what sort of punishment he would give us, perhaps.  Stella, however, says, “No guts, no glory!”  “To have guts” means t o have courage; it’s an informal expression.  “No guts, no glory” means that if you don’t have courage – if you’re not willing to do something that’s difficul t, you’ll never be able to win. In order to get things that you want, things that are  difficult to obtain, you have to have guts, and if you don’t, you will never get those thi ngs.  “Glory” here refers to either being famous but more generally getting somethi ng desirable that you want.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Enrique:  I don’t know how you talked me into coming wi th you to Dan’s apartment to rifle through his papers.  This snooping i s stupid!  If you have suspicions, you should just talk to him.

Stella:  Confront him without any evidence?  That woul d be the height of stupidity.

This episode is a dialogue between Ellen and Hiro.  It ’s going to be using vocabulary that you would use to describe clothing, both old clothing and new clothing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ellen:  What are you wearing to the party?

Hiro:  Your guess is as good as mine.

Ellen:  Let’s look through your closet and I’ll help you pick something out.

Hiro:  Okay, but I have to warn you.  I have a pretty limited wardrobe.

Ellen:  Let’s see, these black pants are nice, but they’re  frayed on the bottom. How about these jeans?

Hiro:  You don’t think they’re too faded?  There’s also  a rip in the back.

Ellen:  No, I guess those jeans won’t work.  I like this shirt, though.

Hiro:  Did you see the stain on the front?  The zipper is also stuck, I think.

Ellen:  How about shoes?  Do you have any shoes that are presentable?

 Hiro:  Well, I always wear these, but they’re scuffed on the top and the sole is pretty worn.

Ellen:  Okay, desperate times call for desperate measures.   Come on!

Hiro:  Where are we going?

Ellen:  We’re going to a magical place with brand spa nking new clothes and where everything is flawless.

Hiro:  Where’s that?

Ellen:  The mall!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ellen asking Hiro, “What are you wearing to the party (what clothes are you going to wear to the party)?”  Hiro says, “Your guess is as good as mine.”  This phrase, “your guess is as good as mine, ” means I don’t know, meaning that you don’t know any more than the per son who is asking you the question.

Ellen says, “Let’s look through your closet (let’s look in you r closet) and I’ll help you pick something out.”  The “closet” is a small opening i n the wall, usually covered by a door where you could store or keep your clot hing.  “To pick something out,” or “to pick out something” is a two-word  phrasal verb meaning to select something from many different options.  Usually it’ s a physical thing; you go to a store and you pick out a dress to wear.  I do thi s at least once a month! That’s to pick out something or to pick something out – ei ther way.

Hiro says, “Okay, but I have to warn you.  I have a prett y limited wardrobe.”  “I have a pretty limited wardrobe” means I have a very limi ted (not very big) wardrobe.  “Wardrobe” here means all the clothing tha t you own, a collection of all of your shirts and pants and ties and dresses and u nderwear and socks – all of that is part of your wardrobe.

Ellen says, “Let’s see, these black pants are nice, but they’ re frayed on the bottom.”  When something is “frayed” (frayed) we mean it is worn out; it is falling apart.  When we talk about clothing, frayed clothing usu ally means that the clothing is beginning to come apart; you can see the ind ividual threads – the individual pieces of the clothing, especially at the edge  of the clothing, at the end of a sleeve on a shirt or on the bottom of your pants.

 Ellen says, “How about these jeans?” meaning what do you  think of these jeans. Hiro says, “You don’t think they’re too faded?”  When w e say something – a piece of clothing is “faded” (faded) we mean that the color isn’t as bright as it used to be.  This happens when you buy blue jeans.  When  you buy them and you put them on the first time the blue may be very blue  – very dark.  But later, as you wash them over and over again, they may become ligh ter – they may become faded, we would say.

Hiro says, “There’s also a rip (rip) in the back (of the j eans).”  A “rip” is the same as a tear; it’s a small hole when two things are separat ed from each other – or something, rather, is separated into two pieces we say tha t it has a rip.  That’s especially used when talking about clothing.  If you’re a man with big muscles, like me, and you put on a shirt that’s too small – tha t’s too tight and then you try to move your arms up and down, you might rip the shirt.  The shirt might get a rip in it (notice it can be a verb or a noun), a tear – i t will come apart.  I have this problem!

Ellen says, “No, I guess those jeans won’t work.  I like th is shirt, though (I like this shirt, however).”  Hiro says, “Did you see the stain (stain ) on the front?”  A “stain” is where there is a color on the fabric that shouldn’t be there.  For example, if you are drinking coffee and you have a white shirt on, and  some of the coffee drops fall onto your shirt, you spill it, then you will have a coffee stain – a brown stain on your white shirt.  Another word for this is a “discolo ration.”

Hiro says, “The zipper is also stuck, I think.”  The “zipper” is the long strip of metal, usually, that you use to keep something together,  but also allows you to open something up.  So on a pair of jeans, for example , there is a zipper in the front at the very top that goes down about, maybe – I d on’t know, one or two inches, and that allows you to take the pants off and pu t them on easily.  It also allows men to use the bathroom, with their pants, more  easily – in ways we shall not describe here!  Hiro complains that the zipper is st uck.  When something is “stuck,” we mean that it isn’t able to move.  It should m ove, it’s supposed to move, but something is wrong with it and it doesn’t move .  You could even get your hand stuck, for example, in a hole.  You put your ha nd into a small hole and then you can’t get it out – your hand is stuck.  Well her e, the zipper is stuck, meaning that it won’t move up and down the way it shou ld.

Ellen says, “How about shoes (meaning what shoes are you g oing to wear)?  Do you have any shoes that are presentable?”  The term “prese ntable” here means they are good enough for other people to see; they are  acceptable or appropriate for whatever occasion that you are going to or being a part of.  Hiro says, “Well, I

 always wear these, but they’re scuffed on the top and the  sole is pretty worn.” “Scuffed” means that there are marks, usually on, for e xample, a pair of shoes or perhaps a wooden floor.  Scuffs are usually caused by two things rubbing together hard.  It causes a discoloration of the shoe; t hat is, there’s a mark on the shoe – maybe not a discoloration, although the scuff is usu ally a different color. “Scuff” can be a verb or a noun.  Hiro says his shoes are scu ffed, which is very common when you wear your shoes a lot.  “The sole is prett y worn,” he says. The “sole” (sole) is the bottom of your shoe, in thi s case.  You can also refer to the bottom of your feet as your sole: “the soles of my fe et.”  “Sole” is also a type of fish – which usually tastes better than your feet, at least my feet!  He complains, Hiro does, that his sole is pretty (again, very ) worn (worn).  “Worn” damaged, old, used; in this case, too thin.  You could see, perhaps, a hole in the bottom of the shoe.  That would be a sole that was wor n.  “Worn,” like the word “stain” we discussed earlier, has a couple of different m eanings in English that are explained – you guessed it – in the Learning Guide.

Ellen says, “Okay, desperate times call for desperate measure s.”  “To be desperate” means that you don’t have any other options and you must do something that you might not otherwise do.  “Measures,”  here, means things that you do, tasks, methods; things that you try to do to, in this case, fix a situation. So this common expression, “desperate times call for despe rate measures,” means that when you have a very difficult situation someti mes you have to do some things that you would not normally do.  The verb h ere, “to call for,” means to require.

So Ellen says, “Come on!” to Hiro, meaning follow me.  Hiro says, “Where are we going?”  Ellen says, “We’re going to a magical place wi th brand spanking new clothes and where everything is flawless.”  Couple of term s here: a “magical place” would be a place with special powers, where impo ssible things can happen.  “Brand,” in the sense of “brand new,” means co mplete new, entirely new.  “Brand spanking new” is just a way of emphasizing it  even more – it’s very new; it’s completely new.  You could say, “this is brand new,” that would be the common way of describing something that you just bought  that no one else has used.  “Brand spanking new” is a little informal; it’s j ust giving more emphasis to this idea that it’s new.

Ellen says this place they’re going is a place where everythi ng is flawless.  A “flaw” (flaw) is a problem, a mistake, an error.  “Fla wless” (with a l-e-s-s at the end) means that it’s perfect, there are no flaws – no p roblems.  Hiro says, “Where’s that?”  Ellen says, “The mall!” meaning the sh opping mall.  So, Ellen is going to take Hiro to buy some new clothing.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ellen:  What are you wearing to the party?

Hiro:  Your guess is as good as mine.

Ellen:  Let’s look through your closet and I’ll help you pick something out.

Hiro:  Okay, but I have to warn you.  I have a pretty limited wardrobe.

Ellen:  Let’s see, these black pants are nice, but they’re  frayed on the bottom. How about these jeans?

Hiro:  You don’t think they’re too faded?  There’s also  a rip in the back.

Ellen:  No, I guess those jeans won’t work.  I like this shirt, though.

Ellen:  Okay, desperate times call for desperate measures.   Come on!

Hiro:  Where are we going?

Ellen:  We’re going to a magical place with brand spa nking new clothes and where everything is flawless.

Hiro:  Where’s that?

Ellen:  The mall!

# Starting a Blog

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 15: Starting a Blog.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 515.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This podcast has its own website.  You may know it, it’s e slpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Starting a Blog.”  It’s a story th at uses a lot of common vocabulary that we use when talking about weblogs or, as they’re commonly called, blogs.  Let’s get started. > I’ve been thinking about starting a blog for a long ti me now, and after talking to my friend Traver, a popular blogger, I’ve decided to take the leap.
> Traver got me started with a basic template, but I want ed to customize the blog to give it my own flavor before launching it.  I alrea dy have my first few posts ready to go, and I plan to update it a few times a we ek.
> Traver told me that it may take a little time for my bl og to catch on and become known in the blogosphere.  He suggested I do some basic se lf-promotion.  He told me to register my website with the major search eng ines and to swap links with other bloggers writing on similar topics.  He gave me some other advice to increase hits and I’m taking it all to heart.
> I can’t wait to get my first comments and to start talking  to other people about our common interest: Our love of cats!

Our story begins with me saying that I’m thinking about starting a “blog,” a special kind of website that has information that you can easily update – you can easily put on the website.  Blogs usually have content that  is added at least a

 couple times a week, or once week, sometimes several times a  day.  So, I’m thinking about starting a blog, and I talk to my friend  Traver, a popular blogger.  A “blogger” is someone who has a blog; it’s the person who  has the blog.

I say that I’ve decided to take the leap.  The expression “ to take the leap” (leap) means to begin to do something that’s new and perhaps u nfamiliar to you; you don’t have a lot of experience, but you’re just going to  start and do it anyway. You’re going to take the leap.  A “leap” is normally a  jump from one point to another, where you physically go up into the air.  But here, it just means to get started.

Traver got me started with a basic template.  A “templa te” (template) is a model for creating, in this case, other documents or other web pages.  A template, in general, is sort of like a model that you use to start something.  So for example, you might have a fax machine and you find on the web a f ax template.  It’s a form that has all of the information that you can then add  to – add your own personal information to.  That would be a template.  Websites,  especially blog sites, often give you some templates so you don’t have to create the sit e all by yourself.

I say that I wanted to customize my blog.  “To customize (so mething)” is to change something so that it’s different from everyone el se’s.  So, you may use a blog template, but you want to use your own pictures or you want to change the way that the writing appears – the font.  That would be to customize it, to make it your own.  I say I want to customize the blog to give it m y own flavor.  Here, “flavor” means my own style, my own characteristic, my own t aste.  Normally, we use the word “flavor” to talk about food, but here I just mean my own particular style.

I want to give the blog my own flavor before launching it.  For some reason, we use the verb “to launch” when we are talking about putt ing up a new website; we also use it in business to talk about starting a new proje ct: “We’re going to launch a new kind of deodorant.”  “Deodorant” is what you put  underneath your arms so that you don’t smell so bad.  Taking a shower also helps!   Anyway, to launch a new product or a new service means to start something, so here I’m talking about starting my blog by launching it.

I already have my first few posts ready to go.  A “post,” w hen we’re talking about a blog, is what we might also call an “entry” (entry).  It’s a small section of text that you add; it’s the new piece of information.  So I may type up a couple of paragraphs and then put it on my blog with today’s date .  That would be one post, and then tomorrow I may add a couple of paragrap hs about a different topic.  That would be another post.  So, a post is each section of your blog – it’s

 each entry of your blog.  “Post” actually has a couple of different meanings, so take a look at that Learning Guide for some more expla nations.

I say that I plan to update my blog a few times a week.   “To update” means to make it more current, bring it up to date, give inform ation that is new.

Traver told me that it may take a little time for my bl og to catch on.  “To catch on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become popular, so mething that is used by or done by many different people.  We often talk abo ut products – things that are sold that may catch on.  For example, cell phones.  Fi fteen years ago very few people had mobile phones (or cellular phones), but  when the price became lower and lower – when it became cheaper and cheaper to buy a cell phone, and the phones became smaller, then cell phones in many countr ies caught on.  They became popular.  Slang expressions is another example of so mething that would catch on – that would become popular

Traver said that it may take a little time for my blog to catch on and become known in the blogosphere.  The term “blogosphere” refe rs to all of the blogs on the Internet.  It is sort of related to another word,  “atmosphere,” which refers to everything around our planet – the air around the pla net.  Blogosphere refers to all the blogs throughout the world.

Traver suggested that I do some basic self-promotion.  “T o promote” means to publicize, to let other people know about your product o r service.  “To self- promote” means to promote yourself, to let other peopl e know about you.  “Self- promotion,” then, is letting other people know about something that you are doing; in this case, your blog.

Traver told me to register my website – to send in my we bsite information to the major or most important search engines.  A “search engin e” is something like Google, Yahoo, AltaVista; they’re websites that help you  find other information on the Internet.  He also suggested I swap (swap) links.  A “ link” on the website is something that you click on that takes you to another websi te or takes you to another file that is on the website.  To “swap” means t o exchange; I give you something and you give me something back.  This is a popul ar way of letting other people know about your website, is to swap to lin ks.  I’ll put your website’s link on my website, and you put mine on yours.

Traver also gave me other advice to increase hits.  A “hi t” on a website is when someone comes to your website – when something is visited o n your website. That’s not the complete technical definition, but it’s cl ose enough for our

 purposes.  “Hit” has several different meanings in English  that are not related to a website; take a look at the Learning Guide for some mor e explanations of those.

I say that I’m taking all of this advice to heart – I’m t aking it all to heart.  The expression “to take (something) to heart” means to listen  carefully to what someone is saying, to think about it seriously, to consider it seriously.

Finally I say that I can’t wait to get my first comments an d to start talking to other people.  Your “comments” are messages that other people  put on your website. So, they come to your website, and if the blog allows it , they put their own ideas and then they post them – they put them on your websit e.  They can comment on what you are saying; it’s a way of starting a conversation,  perhaps, with people who are reading your blog.  And what is my blog going to be about?  It’s going to be about my love of cats, so you know that this story is defin itely fiction!

# Naming and Appointing Officials

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 16: Naming and Appointing Officials.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 516.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

We have a website at eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  If you’re not a Learning Guide member, consider joining and supporting this podcast.  The Learning Guide is an addit ional help to improve your English even faster.

This episode is a dialogue between Goran and Anne.  It  is about when you have official appointments in a company or in a government.  When someone takes a new job – takes a new position, we have some particular vocabulary we use that will be discussed in dialogue.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Goran:  Who do you think will be appointed to succeed Ra mon on the board?

Anne:  I don’t know whom they’ll pick to fill the positi on, but I know who the candidates are.  The higher ups have been quietly vettin g three people to make sure they don’t have any skeletons in their closets.

Goran:  Really?  Who are they?

Anne:  I’m not at liberty to say, but I think at least t wo of the candidates are people outside of the inner circle.

Goran:  You mean we might actually get a new board me mber who’s not buddy- buddy with the higher ups?

Anne:  All I can say is that two outsiders are under consid eration.

Goran:  Wow, that’s huge.  Can you at least tell me if  the remaining candidate is the interim board member?  Everybody thinks he has the in side track.

Anne:  I can’t tell you that.  The selection is being kep t under wraps until next Thursday.  I’ve already let slip too much.

 Goran:  Don’t worry.  My lips are sealed.

Anne:  They’d better be.  You know what they say about l oose lips.

Goran:  Yeah, and I’m not sinking this ship.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Goran asking Anne, “Who do you  think will be appointed to succeed Ramon on the board?”  “To be appo inted” means to be name or chosen, usually for some leadership position.  “To  succeed” can mean to be successful, but here it means to follow, the person  who takes over a job or a position from another person.  We often use this in talking about, for example, the president; we have certain rules in our laws about w hat happens if the president were to die, there is what is called “presiden tial succession.”  It comes from this verb “to succeed” when it means to take the pla ce of.

So, Goran is asking Anne who she thinks will be appointed  (named) to succeed Ramon on the board, probably the board of directors of  a company.  Anne says, “I don’t know whom they’ll pick to fill the position, bu t I know who the candidates are.”  “To fill a position,” or “to fill a job,” mea ns to find someone to take that job, to put someone in that job.  “We need to fill the po sition of secretary,” we need to find someone to work in that position, and when we fil l it, that means we found a person.  Anne says, “I know who the candidates are.”  The “candidates,” here, mean the people who are being considered for a particu lar position.  We use that word also in government.  You have different presidenti al candidates, but you can also have candidates for a position.  When I worked at  the university, every year usually we would have a hiring committee, a group of people who would decide how to fill the open teaching positions we had, and we would have different candidates that we would interview.

Anne says, “The higher ups have been quietly vetting thre e people.”  The “higher ups” refers to someone who works in management, a decision -maker, a leader. The expression is sort of informal, but you will hear it  in business context sometimes.  “Vetting” means to talk to different people , look at their information, and decide who is really the perfect person for this job,  who has the qualifications for this job, and who is not qualified.  “To vet” is the verb (vet).  Once again, we use this sometimes in government.  When the president app oints important members of his government, there is someone who does the vetting – someone who looks into the background, usually to make sure that there isn’t anything bad in their past that would cause a problem.

 So, Anne says, “The higher ups have been quietly vetting t hree people to make sure they don’t have any skeletons in their closets.”  This i s what I was just talking about.  The expression “skeletons in their closets” refers to secrets about their past that might be damaging or embarrassing, thi ngs that would make them unqualified to take the job or position.  So for examp le, if you go and rob a bank and spend five years in prison and then you apply for a job, if they investigate your past – your background, they will find a skeleton in your closet, meaning they will find something that is negative about your backg round.  The word “skeleton” refers to a human being’s bones without anythi ng else on them, or not considering anything else.  If you had a skeleton in your closet, you probably killed someone and then hid them in your closet, which I  don’t recommend – you should bury them somewhere else!

Goran says, “Who are they?”  Anne says, “I’m not at libert y to say.”  When you say “I’m not at liberty to say,” you’re saying I can’t tel l you, I’m not able to tell you, I’m not free to tell you.  It’s a somewhat formal expre ssion.  Anne continues, “but I think at least two of the candidates are people outsi de of the inner circle.”  The expression “inner circle” refers to a small group of peop le who work together or who have the same information about something.  What Anne is saying here is that two of the people they are considering for the po sition aren’t people who are currently working at the company or currently at a leadersh ip position in the company, among those who are in the inner circle – the g roup of leaders, most probably.

Goran says, “You mean we might actually get a new board member who’s not buddy-buddy with the higher ups?”  “To be buddy-buddy” (buddy) means to be a close, personal friend of someone, to have a very close re lationship with someone.  It’s sometimes used in a negative way to say “Oh,  well.  He’s buddy- buddy with the boss, so the boss likes him a lot.”  That w ould mean he’s very friendly with the boss, but not in a way that I really l ike, or perhaps I’m a little jealous of him.  Goran obviously thinks that somebody who i s buddy-buddy with the higher ups is not the best person for the job.

Anne says, “All I can say is that two outsiders are under co nsideration,” meaning they’re being considered, they’re being discussed, they’re a possibility.  Goran says, “Wow, that’s huge.”  “That’s huge” is an informal e xpression meaning that it is very important, or it could be very important.  It’s an  expression that has become more popular in the last, probably, 10 or 15 yea rs.  “Wow, that’s huge.” Goran says, “Can you at least tell me if the remaining candidate is the interim board member?”  If you are “interim” (interim), you a re temporarily in a position; you are in a position, but you are not necessarily going to stay there.  So, if your

 president of your company resigns, they may appoint an int erim president until they have a chance to find the perfect person.  So, they w ill put someone there who they know won’t be there for very long, or at least has to apply for the job formally and be interviewed and vetted just like any oth er candidate.

Here, Goran is referring to an interim board member.   “Everybody thinks he has the inside track.”  “To have the inside track” is to have a n advantage in getting a job, usually because you know somebody in the company.  If I  was interviewing at the university and I was friends with one of the prof essors there, I might have an inside track, meaning I have an advantage over all the  other candidates because I have this relationship already with one of the  professors.

Anne says, “I can’t tell you that.  The selection is bein g kept under wraps until next Thursday.”  “To keep (something) under wraps” (wraps)  means to keep it secret, not to tell other people about it.  Anne says, “ I’ve already let slip too much.”  “To let (something) slip” (slip), or “to let sli p (something),” would mean to accidentally share a secret, to tell someone something th at you didn’t mean to tell them, something that is secret that you weren’t sup posed to tell them.  The word “slip” has a couple of different meanings in Engl ish, as does the word “fill” that we talked about earlier.  For both of those, take  a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Goran says, “Don’t worry.  My lips are sealed.”  Your “lip s” are the opening to your mouth; on the front of your face you have an upper lip and a lower lip.  “To seal (something)” means to close it, so when someone says, “my lips are sealed,” they mean I will not open my mouth, I will no t tell anyone.

Anne says, “They’d better be,” meaning you better not te ll anyone.  “You know what they say about loose lips.”  The expression “loose lips ” refers to people who talk too much, who tell people secrets.  There’s an old  expression: “Loose lips sink ships.”  “To sink” means to, in this case, take a ship or  a boat and make it go down into the water, which, of course, is not want you want your boat or ship to do.  I believe the expression comes from World War I.  W hen you said “loose lips sink ships” back then, the idea was that you shouldn’t tell  anyone, if you are working in the military for example, what the plans are or anything about military secrets, because there could be other people who are you r enemies (spies) listening, and that could hurt people who are on those  ships.  Of course, that would happen in a war.  The enemy would find out whe re your ship is because you were telling secrets, and that could give them the op portunity to sink the ship.

 So, Anne says, “You know what they say (you know the expressi on) about loose lips.”  Goran says, “Yeah, and I’m not sinking this ship,” I’m not going to damage anything or hurt anything by telling anyone anything tha t I know.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Goran:  Who do you think will be appointed to succeed Ra mon on the board?

Anne:  I don’t know whom they’ll pick to fill the positi on, but I know who the candidates are.  The higher ups have been quietly vettin g three people to make sure they don’t have any skeletons in their closets.

Goran:  Really?  Who are they?

Anne:  I’m not at liberty to say, but I think at least t wo of the candidates are people outside of the inner circle.

Goran:  You mean we might actually get a new board me mber who’s not buddy- buddy with the higher ups?

Anne:  All I can say is that two outsiders are under consid eration.

Goran:  Wow, that’s huge.  Can you at least tell me if  the remaining candidate is the interim board member?  Everybody thinks he has the in side track.

Anne:  I can’t tell you that.  The selection is being kep t under wraps until next Thursday.  I’ve already let slip too much.

Goran:  Don’t worry.  My lips are sealed.

Anne:  They’d better be.  You know what they say about l oose lips.

Goran:  Yeah, and I’m not sinking this ship.

I’m pretty sure our scriptwriter doesn’t have any skeleton s in her closet, that’s because it’s Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Watching Competitive Sports

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 17: Watching Competitive Sports.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 517.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

You can go to our website at eslpod.com and download a Learning Guide for this episode.  The Learning Guide is an 8- to 10-page guid e we provide for all of our current episodes that helps you improve your English even f aster.

This episode is a dialogue between Bruno and Tamara ab out watching sporting events that are “competitive,” meaning someone wins and s omeone loses. That’s a pretty broad category, but we’ll talk about some  vocabulary that you would use in a sporting event such as a football game or a baseball game.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bruno:  Hey, what are you doing?  Give me back that remo te!

Tamara:  The movie I want to watch is on right now.  D o you mind?

Bruno:  Of course I mind!  I’m watching the playoffs.  C an’t you see that?

Tamara:  The playoffs?  Oh, I’ll watch with you.

Bruno:  You?  You don’t know anything about sports.

Tamara:  It doesn’t matter.  I always root for the und erdog.  Our team will be victorious!  Go team!

Bruno:  Fine, but I’m rooting for the other team.  Let’s just watch the game, okay?

Tamara:  Your team is going to get pounded.  We will  be the champions!

Bruno:  Please, can I just watch this game in peace?  I’ve  been waiting for it all season.

 Tamara:  Oooh, somebody is a little testy.  I think it’s b ecause you know you’re backing a losing team.  You can’t stand being on the lo sing side.  Am I right? Your players are running scared already.  I can tell.

Bruno:  I’m just trying to follow the game.

Tamara:  Look at that!  Your best player just choked.  H ow could he have missed such an easy shot?

Bruno:  If you don’t be quiet, I’ll show you what it f eels like to get  choked!

[end of dialogue]

Bruno says to Tamara, “Hey, what are you doing?  Give me  back that remote.” “Hey” is used to get someone’s attention; sometimes it ju st means “hi.”  But if you say it with the right intonation like “hey!” then usuall y it’s because you’re angry or upset.  Bruno is upset with Tamara because she took away  his remote. “Remote,” here, stands for remote control; it’s a small device you use to control, for example, your television set or your cable or satelli te TV box.  That is what “remote” means here, but there are other meanings of this word in English, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explan ations.

Tamara says, “The movie I want to watch is on right now.”   “Is on” meaning is currently showing on the television.  “Do you mind?” mea ning is it okay; that’s an informal way of asking someone to stop what they are doi ng, usually because it is bothering you.  So for example, you may be eating at a restaurant and the person next to you is talking loudly on their cell phone, which I absolutely hate.  I could turn to them and say, “Excuse me, do you mind?  We’ re trying to eat here.” I probably wouldn’t do that, especially if they were big ger than I am, but that’s the idea.  You would probably only say it to someone you know;  it’s not something you would say to, say, your boss – unless you don’t mind losi ng your job!

Bruno says, “Of course I mind!” meaning no, I’m not goin g to stop what I’m doing; I am bothered by your request.  He says, “I’m watching the  playoffs.”  The “playoffs” are games that are played at the end of a sea son.  For example, in baseball the season begins in April and it ends in late September.  Then after, in October we have the playoffs; the best teams play against each other for the championship.

Tamara says, “The playoffs?  Oh, I’ll watch with you.  “B runo says, “You!”  He’s very surprised that Tamara wants to watch sports with him.  He says, “You don’t know anything about sports.”  Tamara says, “It doesn’t mat ter (it’s not important

 that I don’t know).  I always root for the underdog.”  “To root (root) for a team” means to cheer for them.  That is, to be in favor of them, want them to win: “I’m going to root for the University of Minnesota.”  That’ s my university, so when they play a football game, I am rooting for them.  In base ball, of course, I root for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Well, Tamara says that she always roots for the underdog.  By the way, “root” has a couple of different meanings in English as well.  Once again, take a look at that Learning Guide for some more explanations.  She’s rooting for the underdog. The “underdog” is the team that is not expected to win,  the team that you believe is the weakest.  So when the United States plays soccer in t he World Cup, they’re probably the underdog, meaning no one really e xpects them to win the championship.  She says, “Our team will be victorious!”  “T o be victorious” means to be the victor, the winner.  “Go team!” she says.  Oft en if you are at a game and you want to cheer, that is, you want to express your supp ort for your team out loud, you use the verb “go,” like “Go Dodgers,” means I want the Dodgers to win. You are telling them to play well, if you will.

Bruno then says, “Fine (okay), but I’m rooting for the o ther team.  Let’s just watch the game, okay?”  Tamara says, “Your team is going to get  pounded.”  “To get pounded” is an informal expression meaning to get beate n badly; they’re going to lose by many, many points.  Tamara is doing what a lot of sports fans do, she’s saying something negative about the other team.  “Your team is going to get pounded,” they’re going to be defeated by a large score .  Tamara says, “We will be the champions!”  The “champions” are the winners, the victors.

Bruno says, “Please, can I just watch this game in peace?”  “To do (something) in peace” means to do it quietly, calmly, without other people making noise or talking or shouting.  I was in the library – public libr ary this afternoon and there was a woman there sitting next to one of the computers,  and she starts talking very loudly on her cell phone.  Did I mention that I r eally hate people who talk loudly on their cell phones in public?  Well, I’m sure t hat the other people in the library wanted to read in peace, meaning without bein g disturbed by loud noises. Unhappily, that is almost impossible nowadays.  But now I ’m sounding like an old man, aren’t I?

Bruno says, “Please, can we just watch this game in peace.  I’ve been waiting for it all season.”  The “season” is the time – the months i n the year when the regular games are played; that’s called the “regular season.”  After that, when you have the playoffs, that’s called, at least in baseball, the “ post season,” after the regular season.

 Tamara says, “Oooh, somebody is a little testy.”  “To be te sty” (testy) means to be easily angered or frustrated.  We might use the wor d “irritable,” someone who gets irritated, who gets bothered by something.  Tamara  says, “I think it’s because you know you’re backing a losing team.”  “To back (som ething or someone)” is to support them.  It could mean here to r oot for them.  In business, if you are backing someone, you are giving them money for their business.  You are an investor; you would be called a “backer,” someone who backs a business. Here, Tamara means that Bruno is rooting a team that she says is going to lose. Tamara says, “You can’t stand (meaning are very bothered b y; you are unable to tolerate or put up with the fact that you are) on the  losing side.  Am I right?  Your players are running scared already.  I can tell (I can see) .”  “To run scared” means to be frightened or worried that something is go ing to happen – something bad is going to happen, especially with your job or perh aps in a competition like a sporting event.

Bruno says, “I’m just trying to follow the game.”  “To f ollow the game” means to pay attention to what is happening.  Tamara says, “Look at that!  Your best player just choked.”  In sports, or in any competition, whe n you say someone “chokes” (chokes), you mean they do not perform well, usual ly because they’re nervous or under too much pressure, and they are not abl e to do what they would normally do.  That’s to choke.  “To choke” also mea ns not to be able to breathe.  If you eat something and it gets stuck in your throat, you could choke; you would perhaps pass out, even die because you were not getting oxygen into your lungs – into your body.  But here, it’s simply means t hat someone is not performing very well.

Tamara says, “How could he have missed such an easy shot?”  Ho w was it possible?  Because it was so easy, the player should have made  this shot. “Shot,” here, would refer to, for example, in a basket ball game when you throw the ball up, that’s called a shot.

Bruno says, “If you don’t be quiet, I’ll show you what it  feels like to get  choked!” “To get choked” means that someone grabs you by the neck an d squeezes so that you are unable to breathe.  We can say that the p erson is “choking,” that’s usually because they eat something, for example, that gets stuck in their throat and they can’t breathe.  Or if you want to kill someone,  you may choke them: “The person was getting choked by his friend, because he wa s angry.”  Of course, that’s very dangerous; you should probably not choke anybody today! Bruno, of course, isn’t serious; he’s not actually going to choke Tamara.  We don’t approve of that on ESL Podcast!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

 [start of dialogue]

Bruno:  Hey, what are you doing?  Give me back that remo te!

Tamara:  The movie I want to watch is on right now.  D o you mind?

Bruno:  Of course I mind!  I’m watching the playoffs.  C an’t you see that?

Tamara:  The playoffs?  Oh, I’ll watch with you.

Bruno:  You?  You don’t know anything about sports.

Tamara:  It doesn’t matter.  I always root for the und erdog.  Our team will be victorious!  Go team!

Bruno:  Fine, but I’m rooting for the other team.  Let’s just watch the game, okay?

# Learning Self-Defense

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 18: Learning Self- Defense.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 518.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there today to download a  Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your looks and your  English even faster!

This episode is called “Learning Self-Defense.”  It’s a d ialogue between a teacher and a student.  The student is learning how she can defe nd herself against other people who may try to harm or hurt her, but she isn’t  a very good student.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Teacher:  Welcome, everybody, to this self-defense class.  To day, you’ll learn how to size up a situation and how to tell the differe nce between a harmless situation and a threatening one.  You’ll also begin t o learn some hand-to-hand combat moves to defend yourselves.

Amy:  Oh, good.  I can’t wait to learn some martial ar ts so I can beat up anyone who tries anything.

Teacher:  Well, the best thing we can do in a dangerou s situation is to avoid having to fight.  It’s not a good idea to confront some one pumped up on adrenaline.  If you can defuse the situation or run awa y, that would be the best strategy.

Amy:  All right, but if someone is harassing me, I want to be ready to do some damage.

Teacher:  I’m not sure if that’s the right mindset…

Amy:  I always trust my instincts.  If my intuition tells m e that someone may be dangerous, I want to get in the first punch.

Teacher:  Whoa, that’s not the purpose of this class.  You ’re here to learn defense, remember?

 Amy:  Yes, but you know what they say: The best defense is a  good offense!

[end of dialogue]

We begin with the teacher saying, “Welcome, everybody, to this self-defense class.”  “Self-defense” are the physical skills to protect your self when someone is attacking you or perhaps you are being attacked by an anim al, but usually it refers to being attacked by another person – another hum an being.  Self-defense allows you to protect yourself so that you don’t get hu rt.  The teachers says that today, you’ll learn how to size up a situation.  “To size up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to assess, to determine the characteristics of so mething including how important it is, or how big it is, or how serious i t is.  To size up a situation is to be able to look at the situation and decide what it s characteristics are: is this important, is this not important, is this person angry, a re they not angry, and so forth.  For more meanings of this word “size,” take a lo ok at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

The teacher says the students are also going to learn h ow to tell the difference (how to distinguish) between a harmless situation and a threatening one. “Harmless” is the opposite of “harm,” harm means to hur t someone or something. If you say something is “harmless,” you mean that it cannot hurt anything or anyone.  Here, we’re talking about a harmless situation , a situation that is not dangerous versus a threatening one.  “To threaten,” as  a verb, means to say or do something to another person so that they are scared or  frightened; usually you’re saying that you’re going to hurt them.  “If you d on’t be quiet, I’m going to punch you in the mouth (I’m going to hit you with my fi st),” that is to threaten someone.  So, “threatening” (with an “ing”) means a d angerous, scary, or frightening situation.

The teachers says, “You’ll also begin to learn some hand -to-hand combat moves to defend yourself.”  “Hand-to-hand combat” is when yo u have two people fighting without any weapons – two people fighting, t ypically, with just their hands.  Sometimes people use it to mean just two peopl e fighting, perhaps one might have a weapon, but the idea is that you have the se two people fighting each other, not with guns usually.  “Combat” is merely a nother word for fight. Here, the students are going to learn some hand-to-h and combat moves.  A “move” is a way that you would move your body; it’s a noun,  a “move.”  You’re doing something with your body, moving your arms and leg s in a certain way, perhaps.  “To defend yourself” means to protect yourself, to make sure that no one else hurts you.

 Amy, the students, says, “Oh, good.  I can’t wait to learn  some martial arts so I can beat up anyone who tries anything.”  Amy says she can’t wait; she is very eager to begin learning some martial arts.  “Martial arts” are the fighting styles, most of which come from Asia, where people learn to de fend themselves without weapons, using only their body.  Karate, Judo, Kung Fu –  these are all examples of martial arts – Tae Kwon Do, and others.  “To beat up (someone)” or “to beat (someone) up” is another one of those two-word phrasal verbs; this one means to hit someone, usually to hit them many times so that yo u have hurt them a great deal – cause them a lot of pain or even injury.  Amy wants to beat up somebody using the martial arts that she’s learning in cla ss.  She wants to be up anyone who “tries anything,” meaning anyone who tries, i n this case, to hurt her.

The teacher said, “Well, the best thing we can do in  a dangerous situation is to avoid having to fight,” you don’t want to have to figh t.  “It’s not a good idea,” he says, “to confront someone pumped up on adrenaline.  “To  confront” usually means to deal directly with someone, especially if that pe rson is dangerous.  To confront someone, in this case, may be to tell someone to  go away or to tell this person that you are going to fight them unless they lea ve, something like that; that would be to confront someone.  You can also confro nt someone in a non- fighting way; you may need to talk to one of your emplo yees or someone who works for you, and you need to talk to them about someth ing they did wrong. You will go up and confront them about the problem.  Maybe they lied, maybe they didn’t do their job, and so forth.  So that can also be confronting someone.

The teachers says, “It’s not a good idea to confront some one pumped up on adrenaline.”  “To be pumped up” means to be very excited , very interested, very eager to do something.  “Adrenaline” is a chemical the body makes when you are excited, frightened, or angry; it usually makes your heart beat faster (go faster) and your breathing faster.  To be pumped up on adren aline can be a dangerous thing because this person may be interested and eager t o fight you, so you don’t want to confront them.  “If you can defuse the situation ,” he says, “or run away, that would be the best strategy.”  “To defuse (defuse) a  situation” means to make it less dangerous, to make it safer.  Now, if you can’t de fuse a situation you can also “run away,” just leave the place where you are.

Amy says, “All right, but if someone is harassing me, I wan t to be ready to do some damage.”  “To harass” (harass) means to bother or an noy someone.  Here, it usually means to makes someone’s life difficult; maybe th ey’re yelling at you, they’re doing things that make you uncomfortable.  Amy wants to be able to do some damage to someone who is harassing her.  “To do some  damage” means to do something that will change a situation; in this ca se, to hurt someone.

 The teacher says, “I’m not sure if that’s the right min dset.”  A “mindset” (one word) is a way of thinking about something; another wor d for this is “perspective.” The teacher says I’m not sure that you, Amy, have the rig ht mindset.  Amy says, “I always trust my instincts.”  Your “instincts” are things that you know naturally, without having studied them or learned them.  It’s sor t of like knowledge you are born with.  Amy says, “If my intuition (which is another word for “instincts”) tells me that someone may be dangerous, I want to get in the first punch.”  A “punch” is an act of hitting a person or a thing very hard with your closed fist – with your closed hand.  “To get in the first punch” means you want  to be the first person to throw a punch; notice we use the verb “to throw a punch, ” to hit someone.  You don’t want to wait until somebody hits you first; you wan t to get in the first punch or you want to throw the first punch.

The teacher says, “Whoa (meaning calm down, wait a min ute), that’s not the purpose of this class.  You’re here to learn defense, rem ember?”  Amy says, “Yes, but you know what they say: The best defense is a good  offense!” “Offense” is the opposite of defense; offense would be t o attack another person or a thing, even though they have not attacked you.  Amy q uotes an old saying: “The best defense is a good offense,” meaning the best w ay to defend yourself is to attack the other person first.  The teacher, I am gu essing, does not agree with Amy’s mindset!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Teacher:  Welcome, everybody, to this self-defense class.  To day, you’ll learn how to size up a situation and how to tell the differe nce between a harmless situation and a threatening one.  You’ll also begin t o learn some hand-to-hand combat moves to defend yourselves.

Amy:  Oh, good.  I can’t wait to learn some martial ar ts so I can beat up anyone who tries anything.

Teacher:  Well, the best thing we can do in a dangerou s situation is to avoid having to fight.  It’s not a good idea to confront some one pumped up on adrenaline.  If you can defuse the situation or run awa y, that would be the best strategy.

Amy:  All right, but if someone is harassing me, I want to be ready to do some damage.

 Teacher:  I’m not sure if that’s the right mindset…

Amy:  I always trust my instincts.  If my intuition tells m e that someone may be dangerous, I want to get in the first punch.

Teacher:  Whoa, that’s not the purpose of this class.  You ’re here to learn defense, remember?

Amy:  Yes, but you know what they say: The best defense is a  good offense!

# Describing Family Relations

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 5 19: Describing Family Relations.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 519.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, in California.

This is dialogue about family relations.  It’s going to use a lot of vocabulary you might use in talking about the way members of your famil y get along, or don’t get along.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Eri:  What’s that?

James:  It’s an invitation to a family reunion.  Once ever y five years or so, someone in the family organizes one.

Eri:  Are you going?

James:  I’m not sure.  It’s always a little awkward seeing extended family.  Did you know that there used to be a big feud between my fa ther and his brother?

Eri:  No, what happened?

James:  I’m not sure, but it was something that happened  before they got married.  My father held a grudge for years.  Then, a bout eight years ago, they made up.  There’s still no love lost between their wives,  but at least there are no hard feelings between the two of them any longer.

Eri:  So you’ll go to the reunion?

James:  I’m not sure.  My mother’s side of the family has a lways looked down on my father’s.  She comes from old money and they didn’t ap prove of her marrying

 my father.  It was really hard on my mother.  She reall y looked up to her mother and they were really close before my father came along.

Eri:  But that’s ancient history, isn’t it?  Considering how things turned out, your grandmother can’t hold it against your mother for marr ying your father.

James:  You’ve never met my grandmother.  One thing everyo ne knows about her is this: She doesn’t know the words to forgive and f orget.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Eri saying, “What’s that?”  Jam es says, “It’s an invitation to a family reunion.”  A “reunion” is when people who used to be together come together again.  After you graduate fro m high school, usually 10 or 20 years after the year you graduate they have a high scho ol reunion, where everyone gets together again.  I’ve never gone to my hig h school reunion, probably never will.  “Family reunion” is when you get t ogether with members of your family, usually cousins, people who perhaps live in a different part of the country even, might travel to a family reunion.  When I was growing up, we had family reunions that we went to usually in the summertim e.  But, of course, just my own family, what we would call my “immediate family,”  had more than 40 people, so didn’t really need the cousins to have a big p arty.

James says, “Once every five years or so, someone in the famil y organizes a family reunion.”  So his friend asks, “Are you going?”  Ja mes says, “I’m not sure. It’s always a little awkward (a little strange) seeing e xtended family.”  “Extended family” are family that are not in your what we call – and what I just called – “immediate family.”  Your immediate family is your fath er, your mother, your brothers, your sisters, their husbands and wives, and prob ably their children – your nieces and nephews.  Your extended family could includ e your grandparents, your cousins, your aunts, your uncles, and so  forth.  Everybody has a slightly different definition of what is “immedi ate” and what is “extended” in terms of family.

James says, “Did you know that there used to be a big feud between my father and his brother?”  A “feud” (feud) is a long, serious a rgument between two people or two groups of people.  It usually is somethi ng that goes on for a very long time, and sometimes it can even be violent.  But he re, I don’t think we’re talking about any violence, just his father and his uncle don’t get along.

Eri said, “No, what happened?”  James says, “I’m not sure , but it was something that happened before they got married (the father an d the mother, presumably).

 My father held a grudge for years.”  “To hold a grudge ” (grudge) means to continue to be angry about something that happened a l ong time ago, especially in a situation where you don’t really have a good reaso n to be angry still.  James says, “about eight years ago, they (his father and uncle) made up.”  “To make up” means to end an argument and become friendly again.  A  husband and wife could be arguing and disagreeing about something and t hey both get mad at each other, but then they make up; they decide they’ll be  friendly again with each other.  The past tense of “make” is “made,” so James says, “ eight years ago, they made up.  There’s still no love lost between their wives,” however.  The expression “there’s no love lost” means there’s no of love or affection, respect or friendship between two people.  Someone says, “Well, t here’s no love lost between me and my neighbor,” that means that you don’t  get along with – you don’t like your neighbor; you certainly don’t love each ot her.  James says there’s no love lost between his mother and his aunt.  He says, “ at least there’s no hard feelings between the two of them any longer.”  “The t wo of them” meaning the father and the uncle.  “Hard feelings” is anger and r esentment, usually because of an argument you had many years ago; it’s very similar to  a “grudge.”  In fact, sometimes after people have an argument and they make u p, they may say, “No hard feelings,” meaning let’s not continue to be angr y at each other.

James’ friend asks him if he’s going to go to the reunion , “So you’ll go to the reunion?” Eri says.  James says, “I’m not sure.  My mother’ s side of the family has always looked down on my father’s.”  “To look down on (someone)” means not to like someone because you don’t think they’re as goo d as you; you think you’re better than them; you disapprove of them.  You sh ould never look down on people who have less money than you, because you’re not necessarily any better than they are.  But unfortunately, the mother of James – her “side of the family,” meaning her relatives, have always looked down on  James’ father’s side of the family.  “Look,” by the way, has many different d efinitions in English, as you probably know.  Take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

James says that his mother comes from old money.  The expressio n “old money” refers to a very rich family that has had a lot of money f or many years, maybe even many generations – 50, 60, 100 years.  The opposite of “old money” would be “new money”; usually we use the French expression “nouve au riche” to refer to people who have recently made money, but there’s a v ery negative connotation to that – a very negative idea.  When you say “nouveau riche” you’re usually looking down on those people, saying that they’re trying to be part of rich society; they’re trying too hard to be accepted by old mone y.  In any case, I don’t have either old money or new money, so it doesn’t reall y matter to me!

 James says that his mother comes from old money and her fami ly didn’t approve of her marrying his father.  “To approve of” means you t hink it’s a good idea; you support it.  So, James says that his mother had a very diffi cult time.  “It was really hard on my mother,” he says, “She really looked up to h er own mother and they were really close before my father came along.”  So he ’s saying that his mother looked up to his grandmother.  “To look up to” is the o pposite of “to look down on.”  “To look up to” means to admire, to respect, to think that someone is a very good person, someone that you want to be like.  So, h is mother and his grandmother got along very well, “they were really close, ” meaning they had a lot of affection, a lot of love for each other; they would talk to each other a lot.  They were really close before his father came along.  To say h e “came along” means that he became part of the situation, he came into the  life of James’ mother. “Close” is another word that has many meanings in Engli sh, so again take a look at our Learning Guide for some more information on t hat.

Eri says, “But that’s ancient history, isn’t it?”  “Ancient history,” when used in a conversation, means something that happened a long time ago, that most people don’t think is important or don’t even remember anymor e.  “Ancient history,” if you are talking about a subject in school, would refer to  ancient civilizations: the ancient Greeks, the ancient Romans in Western Europe, for  example.  But here, if someone says, “Oh, that’s ancient history,” they mean nob ody remembers that, that was a long time ago and is no longer important.  She says, “Considering how things turned out, your grandmother can’t hold it agai nst your mother for marrying your father.”  The expression “to turn out,” or the verb  “to turn out” means to happen or to end in a somewhat unexpected way, especiall y after a long period of time.  It isn’t always, however, unexpected.  You may be watching a football game or a baseball game and then you have to leave be fore it’s over; later, you may ask your friend, “How did the game turn out?”  What  was the result?  So here, she’s saying that considering the result – considerin g how things turned out, your grandmother can’t hold it against your mother .  “To hold (something) against (someone)” means to blame someone for something,  to think that something bad that happened is some particular person’s fault.  In this case, the grandmother is angry at James’ father for marrying James’ mother.

James says, “You’ve never met my grandmother (you don’t know  my grandmother).  One thing everyone knows about her is thi s: She doesn’t know the words to forgive and forget.”  This is an old expressi on, “to forgive and forget.”  The idea is that you should not blame people  or be angry with people for things that happened in the past – bad things.  Instead , you should forgive them; say, “Oh, that’s okay,” and then forget about it, not th ink about it anymore.  When James says “she doesn’t know the words,” he means she has never  heard – or

 more importantly here, she doesn’t believe in the expressi on “to forgive and forget.”  She will never forget.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Eri:  What’s that?

James:  It’s an invitation to a family reunion.  Once ever y five years or so, someone in the family organizes one.

Eri:  Are you going?

James:  I’m not sure.  It’s always a little awkward seeing extended family.  Did you know that there used to be a big feud between my fa ther and his brother?

James:  I’m not sure, but it was something that happened  before they got married.  My father held a grudge for years.  Then, a bout eight years ago, they made up.  There’s still no love lost between their wives,  but at least there are no hard feelings between the two of them any longer.

# Getting Directions and Parking Instructions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 20: Getting Directions and Parking Instructions.

This podcast is a dialogue between a “receptionist” (som ebody who answers the phone at a business) and Asha.  It’s about giving someone “directions” (how to arrive at a certain place), as well as instructions on par king.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Receptionist:  So the meeting is set for 2:00 on Thursda y.  Do you know how to get to our offices?

Asha:  No, I don’t.  Could you give me directions?

Receptionist:  Certainly.  We’re located on Main Street .  The cross street is Udall. If you’re taking the freeway, the best exit to take is Uda ll East.  Once you’re on Udall, head east for about two miles and when you reach  the bend, veer right.  If you veer left, you’ll run into a dead end.  After you ve er right, you’ll be on Monroe Avenue and it’s a one-way street.  Our building is on the right-hand side, past the light.  If you pass Elm Street, you’ve gone too far.

Asha:  Okay, I think I’ve got all that.  Is there parking available?

Receptionist:  Unfortunately, there’s only street parking.   There is valet parking for the building next door, but they charge $12 and we  don’t validate.  There are meters on the street and on the side streets, but you ma y need to circle the block a few times to find an available meter.

Asha:  All right, and thanks for the information.  I g uess I need to leave early to have plenty of time to find the building and to find parking.

 Receptionist:  I tell everybody to count on getting lost  and having to hunt for parking.

Asha:  Thanks for the heads up!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the “receptionist,” the perso n who answers the telephone at a business, saying to Asha, “The meeting is s et for 2:00 on Thursday.”  To say it is “set for” means it is planned for  2:00.  “Do you know how to get to our offices?”  Asha says, “No, I don’t.  Could you give me directions (can you give me instructions on how to get there)?”  “Directi ons” can mean instructions on how to do something, but when we’re tal king about location it’s instructions on how to arrive at a certain place.

Asha doesn’t know how to get to the building, so she asks f or directions.  The receptionist says, “Certainly (meaning yes, of course).  We’ re located on Main Street.  The cross street is Udall.”  A “cross street” is the closest street that intersects with the street that your home or office is on.   So, if you have your offices on Main Street and the street that runs perpen dicular – that crosses that street that is closest to you is Udall, that would be the cross street.  Udall is the cross street.  “If you’re taking the freeway, the best exit to take is Udall East.”  An “exit” on a freeway is where the cars can get off of the  freeway; it’s sometimes called the “off ramp.”  The “on ramp” is how you get o nto the freeway.

So the nearest or best exit is Udall East.  “Once you’re o n Udall, head east for about two miles.”  “Head,” here, is used as a verb: “to  head (somewhere).”  “To head (somewhere)” means to go in a particular direction , to travel in a specific direction, usually north, south, east, or west.  So, the receptionist tells her to “head east,” that means drive toward the east on Udall for about two miles and when you reach the bend, veer right.  “Bend” (bend) he re means a curve in the road.  When you have a road that suddenly starts to go in  a different direction, that’s called a “bend.”  Not necessarily 90 degrees, in fa ct, a bend is usually less than 90 degrees.  The word “bend” has a couple of diff erent meanings in English however, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some m ore explanations.

So, the receptionist tells her that when she reaches the bend she should veer (veer) right.  “To veer” means to change directions with out stopping, usually to go either right or left on the main road.  So in this ca se, the road has a bend in it, but it may also have a continuation – it may be continuing go ing straight and then part of the road, really another road, goes off in an other direction.  So, he’s telling

 her to veer right – go toward the right when she reach es the bend, not left.  If she veers left – if she goes left, in the opposite direction,  she’ll run into a dead end. “To run into (something)” means to encounter something,  to arrive somewhere where you weren’t expecting – something that you didn’t expect perhaps, or something that is a negative influence or an obstacle, som ething that prevents you from doing what you want to do.  In this case, you’l l run into a dead end.  A “dead end” is a street that ends with no connecting stree ts, so you would have to turn around and go out.

So the receptionist continues, “After you veer right, you’ ll be on Monroe Avenue and it’s a one-way street.”  A “one-way street” is a stree t where cars can only move in one direction, not in two directions like most st reets.  He says, “Our building is on the right-hand side, past the light.”  “Past” means beyond.  The “light,” here, means the traffic light; the “traffic l ight” is the box that has three lights: red, yellow, and green.  At least in the Unit ed States red means stop, green means go, and yellow means caution, usually between  the red and the green, when the light is “changing,” we would say.  So , when someone says it’s “past the light,” they mean you have to go past the tra ffic light and it is beyond it, it is farther than that.  He says, “If you pass Elm Street  (if you go past Elm Street), you’ve gone too far.”

Asha says, “Okay, I think I’ve got all that (I think I under stand all of that).  Is there parking available?”  The receptionist says, “Unfortunatel y, there’s only street parking.”  “Street parking” is when you have to park on t he street, not in a parking lot or in a parking garage.  He says, “There is valet par king for the building next door.”  “Valet parking” is when you have somebody who pa rks your car for you. So you drive up to the front of the building, you get out, you give your keys to someone (who we call a “valet”), and that person drives your car and parks it somewhere else so you don’t have to park it.  This is very popular here in Los Angeles; there are lots of restaurants that have valet p arking.  In fact, there’s even a grocery store here that has valet parking!  Of course , valet parking isn’t free normally, and you have to pay extra money.  In this ca se, the valet parking charge is 12 dollars, which is not unusual if it were a business, like a business building.

The receptionist says that we don’t validate.  Often wh en you go to a business that has valet parking you don’t have to pay because the b usiness will say that you are there for their purposes, and therefore they w ill pay your parking.  So you bring in your parking ticket – little piece of paper th ey give you with the time that you entered, and they’ll put a little stamp on it, the y’ll put a mark on the ticket to show that they will pay for it.  That’s to “validate.”  But unfortunately, the receptionist says they don’t validate for the valet parking  for the building next

 door – the building next to theirs.  The receptionist says, “There are meters on the street and on the side streets.”  A “meter” is a mach ine that you put money into, usually coins, to buy a certain amount of time so yo u can park there.  So, “parking meters” are very common, especially in busy places.  You have to pay usually a dollar, maybe two dollars an hour to park in a  particular place.  Parking meters are usually on the street, but you can also find so me public parking meters in “parking lots,” in separate areas just for par king cars.  The receptionist says that there are meters on the street – the street wh ere the building is located, and on the side streets.  A “side street” is a street that  is connected to a main or larger street.  So you may have a big street, and then yo u have small streets that are near it; those smaller streets are called “side street s.”  Often side streets are places where houses are located, but not always.

The receptionist says that you may need to circle the blo ck a few times to find an available meter.  “To circle (something)” means to go ar ound something.  “To circle the block” means to go around the streets that are  surrounding a certain building.  You have to turn right and then go down t he street, and then turn right again and go down that street, and then turn right a gain, go down that street, and turn right again and go down that street – you’re circl ing the block.  The “block” is the space that is like a square; the streets go on all four sides.

Asha says, “All right, and thanks for the information.  I  guess I need to leave early to have plenty of time (to have enough time) to find t he building and to find parking.”  The receptionist says, “I tell everybody to count on getting lost.”  “To count on” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to assume o r believe that something will happen, to depend on or rely on somethi ng.  “Count” has several different meanings in English however, so take a look a t our Learning Guide for some more explanations of that word.

The receptionist says that he tells everybody to count on getting lost, meaning you’re probably going to get lost, so you should give your self extra time.  You should also count on having to hunt for parking.  “To hu nt” means to search, or to look for in this case.  “To hunt for parking” means to ha ve to look for a place to park your car, because it’s so crowded in that area.  Asha s ays, “Thanks for the heads up!” meaning thanks for the warning.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Receptionist:  So the meeting is set for 2:00 on Thursda y.  Do you know how to get to our offices?

 Asha:  No, I don’t.  Could you give me directions?

# Describing Speech and Language Ability

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 21: Describing Speech and Language Ability.

This episode is called “Describing Speech and Language Abi lity.”  It’s a dialogue between Blaire and Antonio.  They are talking to someo ne who speaks a different language and they are having difficulty communicating wit h that person, something I’m sure we all have an experience with.  W e’re going to look at some vocabulary that we use to describe someone’s language abi lity and the way they speak.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Blaire:  Do you have any idea what he’s saying?

Antonio:  It’s Greek to me.  You’re supposed to be the one who’s fluent.  Can’t you make out what he’s saying?

Blaire:  I never said I was fluent.  I said I could ge t by in the language.  There’s a big difference.

Antonio:  Why don’t you try saying something to him?

Blaire:  What should I say?

Antonio:  How about, “I don’t have a good command of the language.  Could you please speak more slowly?”

Blaire:  I don’t think speaking more slowing will help my comprehension. Besides, I only know a few stock phrases, and even those I can  only say haltingly, if I don’t freeze up altogether.

 Antonio:  Give me the phrase book.  I’ll see if I can ge t through to him.

Blaire:  What are you going to say?

Antonio:  I don’t know, but we’re two fairly articulat e people.  We should be able to cobble together a few sentences to get our point acr oss, don’t you think?

Blaire:  Okay, I’ll follow your lead, but, um, just don ’t say anything insulting…like last time.

Antonio:  Are you bringing that up again?!  It’s not  my fault that the entire town misinterpreted what I said!  I was trying to compliment  the women, not insult them.

Blaire:  Tell that to the men who ran you out of tow n!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue between Blaire and Antonio begins with Blaire asking, “Do you have any idea what he’s saying?”  Do you know what this per son is saying?  She doesn’t understand him.  Antonio says, “It’s Greek to me.”   This is an old expression that means I don’t understand anything that I ’m hearing or anything that I’m reading, usually because it’s too difficult or  it’s too technical.  “It’s Greek to me,” Greek being the language of Greece, of course.  The idea is that that would be very difficult for someone to understand.  I’m not sure the exact origin of that expression, but that is the expression we use when  something is very difficult to understand, and you don’t understand any of  it.

Antonio says, “You’re supposed to be the one who’s fluent .”  “To be fluent” means that you can listen to, understand, and speak a lang uage very well.  So, Antonio is saying to Blaire well, you said you were flue nt – you are supposed be fluent in this language; we don’t know what language it is.  Antonio says, “Can’t you make out what he’s saying?”  The verb “to make out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to be able to understand or see something that is difficult to understand or see.  So in this case, the language is diff icult; to make out what he’s saying would be to understand, even though it is dif ficult.  “To make out” also has an informal meaning – very different.  It woul d mean, usually, for a romantic couple to express their physical affection – their  physical liking of each other some way, by kissing for example.  It’s a word that you would probably hear high school students use more than anything.  Althou gh since I didn’t have a girlfriend in high school, I never used the word mysel f that much.

 Anyway, back to our dialogue, not my personal history!  Ant onio says, “Can’t you make out what he’s saying,” and Blaire says, “I never said  I was fluent.  I said I could get by in the language.”  “To get by” means that  you are able to survive; you are able to do something, but not very well.  In th is case, to get by in a language means you could survive in a country that spoke tha t language, but you would not do very well in speaking it.  “Get” is one of  those verbs that has dozens of meanings, for a few of them, take a look at our Lea rning Guide for some explanations.

Blaire says there’s a big difference between getting by a nd being fluent.  Antonio says, “Why don’t you try saying something to him?”  Blaire asks, “What should I say?”  Antonio says, “How about, ‘I don’t have a good com mand of the language.’”  “To have a good command of (something)” means to understand something very well, to be an expert in something, to h ave a lot of knowledge about something.  It could be anything, not just lang uages; you could have a good command of computer programming, you could have a g ood command of podcasting.  Here, it’s being used to refer to how goo d you are – how fluent you are in a language.

Antonio says that Blaire should say to the man, “I don’t have a good command of the language.  Could you please speak more slowly?”  Blai re says, “I don’t think speaking more slowing will help my comprehension.”  Actual ly, it probably will, but…  “Comprehension” means an understanding of what you  are reading or what you are hearing.  Blaire says, “Besides (in addition ), I only know a few stock phrases.”  A “stock (stock) phrase” is a group of words that you have memorized when you are speaking another language, especially if you  can’t think of something on your own.  Stock phrases would be things like : “Hello.”  “How are you?”  “Nice to meet you.”  “Can you tell me where the bathroom is?”  That last one is very important in every language!

Blaire says that she only knows a few stock phrases, “and even  those I can only say haltingly.”  “To speak haltingly” (haltingly) means ver y slowly and with hesitation, or periods of silence between the words.  Th is is very common if you are a beginner in a language, you will speak haltingl y.  You’ll say something and then you’ll stop and you’ll think and you’ll say something else; that’s to speak haltingly.  Blaire says she only speaks haltingly “if I don ’t freeze up altogether.” “To freeze up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to be  unable to do or say anything, usually because you’re very nervous or frightened : “I saw a beautiful woman and I went up to her to ask her name.  And then , when I opened my mouth, I froze up.”  “Froze” being the past tense of “f reeze.”  I wasn’t able to do anything, I was too nervous; I froze up.  That’s why I d idn’t have any girlfriends in high school!

 Blaire is saying that she is too nervous and she doesn’t kno w very much of the language to speak.  So, Antonio says, “Give me the phra se book.  A “phrase book” is a small book that has different expressions in a foreign language. People often have them when they travel to a country whe re they don’t speak the language, so it helps them find the words they need to say what they mean. Phrase books are almost always bilingual by definition, so you have the phrase in your language and then in the language you’re trying t o speak.  Antonio says, “Give me the phrase book.  I’ll see if I can get through  to him.”  “To get through to (someone)” means to help someone understand what you are saying, to communicate your ideas to someone.

Antonio is going to try to use the phrase book to get th rough to this man.  Blaire says, “What are you going to say?”  Antonio says, “I don’t know, but we’re two fairly articulate people.”  “Articulate” means to be ab le to speak clearly and to be understood, to communicate your ideas in a way that othe r people can understand.  Antonio says, “We should be able to cobble t ogether a few sentences to get our point across, don’t you think?”  “To cobble (cobble) together” is a two-word verb meaning to use different  pieces of information to create something useful, especially if you don’t have a clea r plan about what you’re doing.  If you have a situation that you didn’t expect, you may need to cobble together a solution; take a little information from here, take some help from over here, and put them together so that you can su rvive – you can get through the situation.

Antonio is saying that he and Blaire should be able to  cobble together a few sentences – put together a few sentences – to get their  point across.  “To get your point across” means to be able to communicate your id eas so that someone else understands them.  It’s similar to the expression “to get through to,” although “to get through to” can often mean the person is someho w not very bright or has some difficulty understanding you.  “To get your point a cross” is something that we would probably use more in a debate or a discussion or  a formal presentation to someone.

Blaire says, “Okay, I’ll follow your lead.”  “To follow ( someone’s) lead” (lead) means to do what another person is doing, to imitate so meone else’s behavior, to copy what they’re doing, or to let them be the person t hat guides the conversation and you’re going to listen to what they’re saying and then try to say things that would be supportive of that.  Blaire says, “ just don’t say anything insulting…like last time.”  Antonio says, “Are you bringin g that up again?!”  “To bring (something) up,” or “to bring up (something)” i s another two-word phrasal verb meaning to talk about something from the past, to introduce a new topic.  It

 could mean either of those things.  “Don’t bring that up again” means don’t talk about that negative or bad situation from the past.  You can also use “bring up” to mean introduce a new topic of conversation: “I’d like to bring up something we haven’t discussed yet.”  So, it can mean both things.

Well, obviously Antonio did something in the past that B laire is referring to – that Blaire is talking about.  He says, “It’s not my fault tha t the entire town misinterpreted what I said!”  Obviously, Antonio had ano ther problem in using a foreign language, some negative thing that happened that Blaire is bringing up again.  He says, “It’s not my fault that the entire tow n misinterpreted what I said!” “To misinterpret” means to misunderstand, to think that someone is saying something different than what they really are.  Antoni o says, “I was trying to compliment the women, not insult them.”  So apparentl y, we can only guess, Antonio said something about some women.  He was trying  to say something nice about them – something complimentary, but he proba bly didn’t know the language very well and so he, instead, insulted them, s aid something negative about the women, wherever they were.

Blaire says, “Tell that to the men who ran you out of town!”  “To run (someone) out of town” means to make someone leave your city or your  town, usually because they have done something wrong and no one wants t hem there anymore.  Blaire is saying that Antonio thinks that he wa s misinterpreted, but she says that the people who misinterpreted him would have a  different opinion.  So, “Tell that to the men who ran you out of town” means tell that to the men who were angry at what he had said about the women in thi s particular place.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Blaire:  Do you have any idea what he’s saying?

Antonio:  It’s Greek to me.  You’re supposed to be the one who’s fluent.  Can’t you make out what he’s saying?

Blaire:  I never said I was fluent.  I said I could ge t by in the language.  There’s a big difference.

Antonio:  Why don’t you try saying something to him?

Blaire:  What should I say?

 Antonio:  How about, “I don’t have a good command of the language.  Could you please speak more slowly?”

Blaire:  I don’t think speaking more slowing will help my comprehension. Besides, I only know a few stock phrases, and even those I can  only say haltingly, if I don’t freeze up altogether.

Antonio:  Give me the phrase book.  I’ll see if I can ge t through to him.

Blaire:  What are you going to say?

Antonio:  I don’t know, but we’re two fairly articulat e people.  We should be able to cobble together a few sentences to get our point acr oss, don’t you think?

Blaire:  Okay, I’ll follow your lead, but, um, just don ’t say anything insulting…like last time.

Antonio:  Are you bringing that up again?!  It’s not  my fault that the entire town misinterpreted what I said!  I was trying to compliment  the women, not insult them.

Blaire:  Tell that to the men who ran you out of tow n!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 22: Developing a Healthy Mind.

This episode is called “Developing a Healthy Mind.”  It’s a conversation between Luke and Lorelai, giving their views on what it means to  have a healthy mind. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lorelai:  I just finished reading a book about how to get the most out of life. Starting today, I’m going to live life to its fullest.

Luke:  Oh no, not another one of your fads.  Weren’t yo u eating only blue- and red-colored foods a couple of months ago?

Lorelai:  This is not a fad!  I’m changing my lifestyle so  I’ll be able to live a happier and more fulfilling life.

Luke:  And didn’t you go through a phase where you spoke only to animals?

Lorelai:  I’m not listening to you, and I’m not dwel ling on the past.  I’m living in the moment and enjoying everything around me.  I’m ignorin g your negativity and concentrating on appreciating the moment.

Luke:  What are you doing now?

Lorelai:  I’m practicing mindfulness.  I’m repeating m y mantra and calming my mind.  You should try meditation.  It may help you with  your problems.

Luke:  What problems?

 Lorelai:  We could start with your judgmental attitud e and your close- mindedness.  How’s that?

Luke:  Forget it!  Nothing can get me to buy your late st hocus pocus!

[end of dialogue]

This episode is called “Developing a Healthy Mind.”  “Hea lthy” is the opposite of “sickly” or “ill.”  We usually use this term to talk about your physical body.  But here, it’s being used a little differently, it’s being used to talk about your mind, the way you think and whether that is healthy or not – the w ay you think, perhaps. People have different ideas about this, of course.

Lorelai begins our conversation by saying that she just fini shed reading a book about how to get the most out of life.  The expression  “to get the most out of life” means to enjoy life as much as possible, to experience lif e in its fullness – in its completeness.  Usually people talk about this when they are  referring to success or enjoying life somehow.  So, Lorelai’s reading a boo k which is very common at least in the United States, what we call “self-help” bo oks, books that people read to try to make them happier or better or healthier.  Lorelai says that she’s going to live, starting today, life to its fullest.  “To live life to the fullest” means something similar to “getting the most out of life,” t o enjoy life as much as possible.

Luke says, “Oh no, not another one of your fads.”  A “fad ” (fad) is something that becomes popular very quickly and remains popular for a short  period of time, and then everybody forgets about it.  This happens with songs, this happens with television shows, it happens with dances.  In particular,  I remember a few years ago there was a dance fad called the Macarena, and it h ad these moves that you would…oh well, forget it.  It was a fad, and everyone’ s forgotten it already. That’s what a fad is, something you forget that is very po pular but then is no longer popular.  In the 1970s a fad was pet rocks.  Peop le sold these rocks like they were pets; it was amazing!

So anyway, getting back to our story Luke says, “Weren’t yo u eating only blue- and red-colored foods a couple of months ago?”  Obviously Lorelai likes to try new and different, perhaps strange things, like eating food that is blue and red. Lorelai says that this is not a fad.  “I’m changing my lif estyle so I’ll be able to live a happier and more fulfilling life.”  Your “lifestyl e” is the way that you live, the way you spend your time for example.  “Fulfilling” means sat isfying, giving you a sense of happiness and completion.  So, a fulfilling lif e would be a life that was satisfying, that was happy, that was complete.

 Luke says, “And didn’t you go through a phase where you o nly spoke to animals?”  Luke is reminding Lorelai of all of the some what crazy fads that she was part of in the past.  He says, “didn’t you go throug h a phase?”  “To go through a phase” (phase) to means to experience a certai n period in your life when you become very interested in a certain thing; it’s sort of like a fad, but it’s something that you personally get involved in.  It could be for months or even years.  The expression is often used to talk about people who are going through some sort of change in their life that perhaps isn’t ne cessarily positive or is experiencing some sort of difficulty.  We might talk abou t a teenager going through a phase.  They’re going through a part of th eir life where they’re angry at everyone or they don’t like to talk to their parents.  Th is is usually a somewhat temporary situation; it doesn’t go on forever, we hope.   That would be going through a phase.

Lorelai says, “I’m not listening to you, and I’m not dwe lling on the past.”  “To dwell (dwell) on (something)” means to spend a lot of time thinking about something, especially something that makes you sad or makes you angry. People may say, “Don’t dwell on it” if something bad ha ppens to you – don’t keep thinking about it over and over again.  “Dwell” has a co uple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Lorelai says, “I’m living in the moment and enjoying ever ything around me.”  This is a popular self-help idea: to live in the moment – t o focus on what you are doing right now; don’t worry about the past, don’t worry abo ut the future.  Live in the moment – live in the now.  Lorelai says, “I’m ignoring  your negativity and concentrating on appreciating the moment.”  “Negativity”  is when someone always sees the bad side of things, one only thinks about the negative things. The noun is “negativity.”  “To appreciate” means to recog nize the goodness in something, to value something.  So, Lorelai says she’s going to ignore Luke’s negativity and concentrate on appreciating the moment – appreciating what’s happening right now.

Luke says, “What are you doing now?”  Lorelai says, “I’m pr acticing mindfulness.” “To practice” means to follow some rules or guidelines a bout how to live your life, in this case.  But “practice” has a couple of different meanings, so take a look at that Learning Guide, once again, for some more expla nations.  Lorelai is practicing mindfulness.  “Mindfulness” is a notion – an i dea that you are aware of what is going on around you; you are paying attention t o what you are doing. There’s an old expression: “to be mindful of (something )” means to be paying attention, to be concentrating on, to know what was g oing on.  More recently, people have talked about mindfulness as being a way that  you are always aware

 of what is around you, and this is supposed to somehow he lp you be calmer, help you appreciate life.

Lorelai goes on to say that she’s repeating her mantra a nd calming her mind. She says to Luke, “You should try meditation.  It may hel p you with your problems.”  So, Lorelai is doing “meditation,” which i s the practice in many different traditions, both religious and nonreligiou s, of focusing on something, controlling your thoughts.  In some types of meditation, it’s focusing only on one thing.  In other types of meditation it could be trying  to focus on nothing – emptying your mind, if you will.  Those are kinds of medi tation.  One way of meditating in some traditions is to use what’s called a “mantra” (mantra).  This is a word or a phrase that you repeat many times to yourself  quietly as a part of concentrating – focusing on a certain thing, and not havi ng other thoughts.  The idea is that it makes you calmer physically – physiologically.  “To calm your mind” means to give you a sense of relaxation, of peace.

Lorelai says that Luke should try meditation to help him  with his problems.  Luke says, “What problems?”  Lorelai says, “We could start with your judgmental attitude and your close-mindedness.”  “We could start” mea ns well, there are many things that we could talk about, but here’s one.  “We could start with you judgmental attitude.”  To be “judgmental” means to a lways be giving someone your opinion, whether you like something or don’t like so mething.  Usually, it’s a negative way of talking about someone.  If you say someone is judgmental, that’s a criticism.  You’re saying they’re always telling people t hings they don’t like – they’re always judging other people, criticizing other p eople.  So, you’re criticizing them, which I guess would make you judgmental, I’m not sure.  “Close- mindedness” means not willing to listen to other peopl e’s opinions or ideas, only having your own ideas and not even paying attention to what other people are saying, not being willing to listen to other people.  Lorelai is saying that Luke is judgmental and close-minded.

Luke says, “Forget it!  Nothing can get me to buy your lat est hocus pocus!” When Luke uses the expression “to buy,” he doesn’t mean gi ve money to someone in order to that something back.  He means to be lieve or accept something.  Someone may say to you, “I’m not buying it.  He says that he didn’t go to work today, but I’m not buying it.”  That means “ I don’t believe it; I don’t accept it.”  Well Luke doesn’t believe the ideas that Lo relai has about meditation and mantras and mindfulness; he says “I’m not going to bu y your latest hocus pocus!”  “Hocus pocus” is something that, in this case, is imp ossible or false.  It’s a set of ideas that you think are silly – that you think a re nonsense, and that’s what Luke thinks about Lorelai’s ideas.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lorelai:  I just finished reading a book about how to get the most out of life. Starting today, I’m going to live life to its fullest.

Luke:  Oh no, not another one of your fads.  Weren’t yo u eating only blue- and red-colored foods a couple of months ago?

Lorelai:  This is not a fad!  I’m changing my lifestyle so  I’ll be able to live a happier and more fulfilling life.

Luke:  And didn’t you go through a phase where you spoke only to animals?

Lorelai:  I’m not listening to you, and I’m not dwel ling on the past.  I’m living in the moment and enjoying everything around me.  I’m ignorin g your negativity and concentrating on appreciating the moment.

Lorelai:  I’m practicing mindfulness.  I’m repeating m y mantra and calming my mind.  You should try meditation.  It may help you with  your problems.

Luke:  What problems?

Lorelai:  We could start with your judgmental attitud e and your close- mindedness.  How’s that?

Luke:  Forget it!  Nothing can get me to buy your late st hocus pocus!

# Having Trouble Making a Decision

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 23: Having Trouble Making a Decision.

This episode is called “Having Trouble Making a Decision.”  It’s a dialogue between Lorenzo and Katia; they’re talking about buying  a new television and all of the things that they need to think about.  We’ll be  hearing a lot of expressions that you might use when you are talking about making a d ifficult decision.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lorenzo:  Have you bought a new television yet?

Katia:  No, I’m still looking at consumer reviews and wei ghing my options.  I’m not sure yet what size I want or what features I need.  I’m keeping my options open for now.

Lorenzo:  I thought your old TV stopped working three w eeks ago.  You still haven’t made up your mind about buying a new one?

Katia:  Oh, I’ve decided to buy a new one.  It’s which one I’m going to buy that’s making me hesitate.  There are so many options to choose from.  I want to approach this logically and decide only after I’ve done t he proper analysis.

Lorenzo:  It’s only a TV.  It’s not like it’s a house or e ven a car.

Katia:  I know, but I’m the one who has to live with t he decision.  I’ll look at it every day, and if I don’t make the right decision, it’ll haunt me for years.

Lorenzo:  You know what I think?

Katia:  What?

 Lorenzo:  I think you’re crippled by indecision, and you’ re stalling.  The sooner you make a decision and buy a new TV, the better.

Katia:  Hey, what are you doing?  Where are you taking  me?

Lorenzo:  We’re going to the electronics store this minut e, and you’re buying a TV – today!

Katia:  What if I regret my decision?

Lorenzo:  Then I’ll buy you a new one.

Katia:  Fine, but I’m holding you to that!

[end of dialogue]

Lorenzo begins our dialogue asking Katia, “Have you bough t a new television yet?”  Katia says, “No, I’m still looking at consumer revi ews and weighing my options.”  What a lot of people do now, especially with  the Internet, before they buy something they look to see what other people think about it – what their opinion is.  If you buy a book on Amazon.com, there are all sorts of reviews – customer or consumer reviews.  “Customer” and “consumer” mea n the same thing, the person who buys something.  So you can look at  their opinion, that’s what their “review” is, their opinion about this produ ct or service.

Katia says she’s still looking at consumer reviews and weighin g her options.  “To weigh (weigh) your options” means to carefully consider a ll of your choices to determine which one is best.  That’s weighing your optio ns.  Sometimes, of course, you don’t have very many options, so you don’t have m uch to weigh! Katia says, “I’m not sure what size I want or what featur es I need.”  “Features” are things that a product offers you.  It might be a co lor television, that could be a feature.  Or, it might be a television that has a digi tal video recorder, that would be a feature.  Katia says, “I’m keeping my options open f or now.”  To keep your options (your choices) open” means not to make a decision ye t; wait until you have looked at all the possibilities – all of the option s.  So, “to keep your options open” means think about it some more, wait until you ha ve more information.

Lorenzo says, “I thought your old TV stopped working thre e weeks ago.  You still haven’t made up your mind about buying a new one?”  L orenzo’s a little surprised since Katia has not had a television for three weeks.  He says, “You still haven’t made up your mind.”  “To make up your mind ” means to make a

 decision.  Sometimes we use that expression when someone i s having difficulty making a decision and you are getting impatient, you wan t them to hurry up.  You may say, “Oh, make up your mind.”  Make a decision – make up your mind.

Katia says, “Oh, I’ve decided to buy a new one,” that’s he r decision, “It’s which one I’m going to buy that’s making me hesitate.”  “To h esitate” means to delay, not to do something right away.  She says, “There are so many options (so many possibilities – choices) to choose from.  I want to approa ch this logically and decide only after I’ve done the proper analysis.”  To do  something “logically” means to do it rationally, following clear thinking.  “ Analysis” is when you do careful research and examination of something to underst and it better.  A scientist would do analysis on the results of his or her stud y.  That’s analysis; analysis just means to think about it, to look at all the information, to make careful judgments about it.

Lorenzo thinks that Katia is being too careful.  He says, “ It’s only a TV,” meaning it’s not that important, “It’s not like it’s a house or  even a car.”  A house and a car are much bigger purchases – much more expensive, so you migh t think about them more.  A television is less important, and so you pro bably don’t need to think about it all that much, but Katia does.  She says, “I know, but I’m the one who has to live with the decision.”  “To live with the d ecision” means to accept the consequences – the results of what you decided.  If you  buy a small car, and then you want to take all of your friends to the beach,  well, that’s not going to be possible.  You have to live with your decision.  In this case, it could mean a good thing; it could mean a bad thing.

Katia says, “I’ll look at it every day, and if I don’t ma ke the right decision, it’ll haunt me for years.”  “To haunt (haunt) (someone)” me ans that someone is bothered, worried, or concerned about something bad t hat happened in the past, or about a bad decision that you’ve made and you continu e to think about it.  It haunts you – you’re reminded of it every day or very freque ntly.  Katia’s worried about making the wrong decision because she doesn’t want i t to haunt her for years.

Lorenzo says, “You know what I think?”  Katia says, “What? ”  Lorenzo says, “I think you’re crippled by indecision, and you’re stalling. ”  “To be crippled” (crippled) means, in this case, to be unable to do somet hing, to be unable to work properly or correctly.  The word “cripple” has a coup le of different meanings in English however, so take a look at the Learning Guide  for some more explanations.  “Indecision” is the inability to make a deci sion, the inability to decide, when you can’t decide because, for whatever reason,  you are unable to. So, Lorenzo is saying that Katia is crippled by indecision; she can’t do anything

 because she can’t decide, and so she’s stalling.  “To stall”  (stall) means to delay in doing something, usually to do other, less important things because you don’t want to do the thing you’re supposed to do.  You’re d elaying it; you’re waiting longer and longer to do it.  “Stall,” like “cripple, ” has a couple of different meanings, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some  explanations of that.

Lorenzo says, “The sooner you make a decision and buy a ne w TV, the better.” Katia says, “Hey, what are you doing?  Where are you takin g me?”  Lorenzo says, “We’re going to the electronics store this minute, a nd you’re buying a TV – today!”  Lorenzo is taking her to the electronics store, a story that sells televisions, radios, telephones, computers perhaps – thing s that are electronic in nature.  They’re going to the electronics store this minu te, meaning immediately, right now, and you’re going to buy a TV today, he says.

Katia says, “What if I regret my decision?”  “To regret” is to wish that you hadn’t done something, to wish that something had not happene d.  When someone thinks you’re making the wrong decision they may say to you, “you’re going to regret that decision,” you’ll regret it.  They might e ven say “you’ll live to regret it,” meaning you may not regret it immediately, but in the future you’ll look back and say “I made a mistake.”  So “to regret” something is to r ealize that you’ve made a mistake, to wish that you had made a different decision.

Katia says, “What if I regret my decision?”  Lorenzo says, “T hen I’ll buy you a new one,” meaning a new television.  Katia says, “Fine ( meaning okay), but I’m holding you to that!”  “To hold (someone) to (somethi ng)” means to make someone keep a promise, to make sure that the person is g oing to do what they say they are going to do.  If you tell your children you’r e going to take them to a movie this weekend your children are probably going to h old you to it, meaning on Friday or Saturday you can’t say, “Oh, you know what ki ds?  We’re not going to go to a movie.”  Well, your children will not be ver y happy, I don’t think!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lorenzo:  Have you bought a new television yet?

Katia:  No, I’m still looking at consumer reviews and wei ghing my options.  I’m not sure yet what size I want or what features I need.  I’m keeping my options open for now.

 Lorenzo:  I thought your old TV stopped working three w eeks ago.  You still haven’t made up your mind about buying a new one?

Katia:  Oh, I’ve decided to buy a new one.  It’s which one I’m going to buy that’s making me hesitate.  There are so many options to choose from.  I want to approach this logically and decide only after I’ve done t he proper analysis.

Lorenzo:  It’s only a TV.  It’s not like it’s a house or e ven a car.

Katia:  I know, but I’m the one who has to live with t he decision.  I’ll look at it every day, and if I don’t make the right decision, it’ll haunt me for years.

Lorenzo:  You know what I think?

Katia:  What?

Lorenzo:  I think you’re crippled by indecision, and you’ re stalling.  The sooner you make a decision and buy a new TV, the better.

Katia:  Hey, what are you doing?  Where are you taking  me?

Lorenzo:  We’re going to the electronics store this minut e, and you’re buying a TV – today!

Katia:  What if I regret my decision?

Lorenzo:  Then I’ll buy you a new one.

Katia:  Fine, but I’m holding you to that!

This episode is called “Talking About Failure.”  It’s a d ialogue between Akiko and Gerry using vocabulary that we would employ – that we wou ld use when talking about things that go wrong – things that fail.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Akiko:  How did your presentation go over this morning a t the meeting?

Gerry:  It was a complete flop!

Akiko:  I don’t believe it.  You spent weeks working on t hat presentation.

Gerry:  It wasn’t the presentation that bombed.  It w as my big idea.  Leona called it a retread of what I presented last year, and she wa s not in the least impressed.

Akiko:  Ouch, that’s pretty harsh.  What did the others sa y?

Gerry:  Overall, the response was dismal.  Everyone else  was trying to be tactful, but it boiled down to the fact that they thought it w as pathetic.

Akiko:  I’m sure that’s not true.  And if they didn’t ju mp up and down about the idea right away, they’re bound to come around after y ou give them more details.

Gerry:  I don’t know…

Akiko:  Come on, aren’t you the same guy who told me th at you didn’t know the meaning of the word “quit”?

 Gerry:  That was before this morning’s presentation.

Akiko:  Are you giving up on your great idea?

Gerry:  No, I guess not, but it’ll take some reworking…

Akiko:  Good, then you won’t give up?

Gerry:  I guess not.  What the heck?  I’m only risking more  humiliation and failure, right?

Akiko:  That’s the spirit!

[end of dialogue]

Akiko begins by asking Gerry, “How did your presentation go over this morning at the meeting?”  The phrasal verb “to go over” here mea ns how did people like it, how was it received – did people think it was good or b ad?  Something that “goes over well” is something that is good.  Something that “ goes over poorly,” obviously, is something that is bad.  So, we use this expre ssion “to go over” when we’re talking about a presentation, perhaps a per formance; it might also be used in asking someone about something that they told some body that might have been difficult for them to accept: “I told my boss I  was leaving in two weeks. That didn’t go over very well.”  He didn’t like it; he  didn’t receive the news very well.

Gerry says his presentation was a complete flop (flop).  “ Flop” is a slightly informal way of saying “failure,” something that didn’t  work as you planned, something that didn’t work correctly.  Again, usually use d to describe a performance of some sort or a presentation.  We might sa y, “The movie was a flop,” we mean the movie was a failure, nobody liked it , it wasn’t popular, it didn’t make any money.

Akiko says, “I don’t believe it.  You spent weeks working on that presentation.” Akiko doesn’t think it was a flop.  Gerry, however, insists,  “It wasn’t the presentation that bombed.”  “To bomb” in this context m eans to fail, when some event or project doesn’t work as well as you had hoped.  O nce again, we can use the example of a movie: “The movie bombed.”  It means it wasn’t very successful.  A television show, a performance, a comedy rou tine (somebody telling jokes) – those are all things that can bomb.  Bo th the word “bomb” and

 “flop” have different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations of those two terms.

Gerry says that the presentation didn’t bomb, it was his big idea.  In other words, it wasn’t the way he presented it, it was what he was sayi ng – the content, the idea behind his presentation.  “Leona called it a ret read of what I presented last year.”  A “retread,” here, means something that is repe ated from a previous project or a previous idea; it’s usually an insulting term  – a negative term saying that it wasn’t original.  Gerry says that Leona was not in the least impressed. “Not in the least” means not at all, not even a littl e bit: “Are you enjoying your new job?” and you say, “Not in the least.  It’s horrible, an d I want to quit.”  That’s usually what I say when I start a new job!

Akiko says, “Ouch, that’s pretty harsh.”  When someone says “ouch ” in a situation like this they mean oh, that must hurt.  “Ouch”  is a word we use to express pain.  Somebody punches you or you hit your arm on t he door, you might say “Ouch!”  It’s when something hurts.  Well, this comment of Leona’s certainly hurt Gerry.  Akiko says, “Ouch, that’s pretty harsh. ”  “Harsh,” in this case, means very negative, perhaps rude, something that is ve ry direct.  If you go up to a man and say, “Excuse me, you’re really ugly,” w ell, that’s pretty harsh!

Gerry says that the response, overall, from the other peop le at the presentation was dismal.  “Dismal” (dismal) means not good, very bad, depressing, negative. You might describe the weather as dismal, or you might describe a book as dismal.  Gerry says that everyone else was trying to be tactf ul.  “To be tactful” (tactful) means to be very polite, to tell someone some thing with a lot of respect, but usually it’s bad news.  You’re criticizing someone; you ’re saying something bad about them, but you’re trying to be nice about it  – you’re trying to say it in a nice way.  That’s being tactful.  Gerry says that it boiled  down to the fact that they thought his idea was pathetic.  “To boil down to (somet hing)” means to be the same as something else, to give a summary of something, to get down to the very necessary – the important details of something.  You m ay have lots of different reasons for buying a new car, but you probabl y have one or two reasons that are most important.  So if you take away all the other ideas – all the other things you could consider, these are the things that are t he most important.  So, that’s what it means to boil down to: “I like the color  of the car, I like the seats, but it boils down to the price; that’s the most important t hing.”  It’s the most essential element.

Gerry said that it boiled down to the fact that they th ought his idea was pathetic (pathetic).  Something that is “pathetic” make you feel  sad because it is such a sad, useless thing.  It’s something that deserves your sympat hy.  Something that

 is pathetic is so bad that you feel sorry for the person wh o’s doing it or who’s experiencing it.  That was how bad Gerry’s idea was, I gu ess.  We’re not told what his idea was.

Akiko says, “I’m sure that’s not true.  And if they didn’t jump up and down about the idea right away, they’re bound to come around afte r you give them more details.”  When you say somebody “jumps up and down about  (something),” you mean they’re very excited about something.  “To be bound  to” means to be certain to happen, something that is very likely going to happen.  What Akiko is saying here is that even though the other people at Ger ry’s presentation weren’t excited about it, they didn’t jump up and down right away, they’re bound to come around after you give them more details.  They’re very li kely to come around. “To come around,” here, means to finally agree with som eone even if you had a different opinion originally: My wife asked me to wear a green shirt because she thinks it looks good on me; I’ll don’t like the idea, bu t finally I come around to it.  I decide okay, I’ll wear the green shirt.  I’ll wear anyth ing my wife tells me to wear, that’s the way it works!  So here, Akiko is saying that the  people are going to eventually like this idea once they get more details – mo re specific information about it.

Gerry says, “I don’t know,” he’s doubtful.  Akiko tries to cheer him up – tries to make him happy by saying, “Come on, aren’t you the same g uy (the same man) who told me that you didn’t know the meaning of the word ‘quit’?”  The expression “he didn’t know the meaning of the word…” and  then you put in the word, is a common one to say that a person is the opposit e of whatever that word is.  So if Gerry doesn’t know the meaning of the word “quit,” that means he’s never going to quit; he’s going to continue on, the o pposite of quitting.

Gerry says that that was before this morning’s presentatio n, meaning that’s what he said before he made the presentation but he no lon ger thinks that.  Akiko says, “Are you giving up on your great idea?”  “To give up ” means to abandon, to say okay, I’m not going to do that anymore.  Gerry says, “No , I guess not, but it’ll take some reworking.”  “To rework (something)” means to i mprove it, to revise it because it’s not good enough yet.  Akiko says, “Good, then you won’t give up?” and Gerry says, “I guess not.  What the heck?”  The expression  “what the heck” is a phrase used to show that you plan on doing something  even though it might not be successful: I’m not a very good bowler – I don’t kn ow how to bowl, but what the heck, I’m going to play a game with my friend because it’s fun, even though I’m going to do a bad job at it – what the h eck.

So, Gerry says, “What the heck?  I’m only risking more hum iliation and failure, right?”  “Humiliation” is when you are very embarrassed b y something or

 someone.  So, Gerry is saying well, I’m probably not goin g to succeed – I’m probably going to fail, but I’m going to try anyway.  Of course, it’s not a good thing to think about being humiliated, so Gerry is kind  of joking here.  Akiko says, “That’s the spirit!”  “That’s the spirit” is normally an expression we use to encourage someone else, to make them have the right at titude.  But here, and often now, it’s used sarcastically; that is, Akiko’s making a j oke.  Gerry doesn’t seem to be very enthusiastic about his plan; he thinks it’s g oing to cause him to fail, and Akiko is making fun of his negative view, saying, “Oh, that’s the spirit,” when, of course, she means the opposite.  That’s not the spirit – that’s not the attitude that he should have.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Akiko:  How did your presentation go over this morning a t the meeting?

Gerry:  It was a complete flop!

Akiko:  I don’t believe it.  You spent weeks working on t hat presentation.

Gerry:  It wasn’t the presentation that bombed.  It w as my big idea.  Leona called it a retread of what I presented last year, and she wa s not in the least impressed.

Akiko:  Ouch, that’s pretty harsh.  What did the others sa y?

Gerry:  Overall, the response was dismal.  Everyone else  was trying to be tactful, but it boiled down to the fact that they thought it w as pathetic.

Akiko:  I’m sure that’s not true.  And if they didn’t ju mp up and down about the idea right away, they’re bound to come around after y ou give them more details.

Akiko:  Come on, aren’t you the same guy who told me th at you didn’t know the meaning of the word “quit”?

Akiko:  Are you giving up on your great idea?

# Falling in Love

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 25: Falling in Love.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 525.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Falling in Love.”  It is a dialog ue between Maya and Jorge about that old story, a boy and a girl.  Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Maya:  What are those?

Jorge:  They’re pictures from our ski trip last weekend.

Maya:  Is there any reason you’re staring at the ones with  Jessica in them?  I think you’ve got a crush on her.

Jorge:  I’m not 10 years old.  I don’t get crushes.

Maya:  Then, I think you’re falling head over heels for her.

Jorge:  Don’t be ridiculous.  I’ve only just met her.

Maya:  I knew it was love at first sight when I introduced  you at Yannick’s party.  I could see the sparks fly.  I couldn’t miss her blush or your silly grin.  There was certainly a lot of chemistry between the two of you, that ’s for sure.

Jorge:  I hardly talked to her at the party.

Maya:  Yes, but I could see her stealing glances at you al l night.

Jorge:  That must have been a figment of your imaginati on.

 Maya:  Oh, really?

Jorge:  Okay, I won’t deny that I’m attracted to Jessica, b ut I can’t speak for her.

Maya:  Yes, but I can.

Jorge:  What?

Maya:  She asked me about you.

Jorge:  When?

Maya:  Yesterday, at lunch.

Jorge:  What did she say?  What did you  say?

Maya:  That’s for me to know and for you to find out!

[end of dialogue]

Maya asks Jorge, “What are those?”  Jorge is looking at som e pictures; he says, “They’re pictures from our ski trip last weekend.”  Appare ntly, he and some friends went skiing.  Maya says, “Is there any reason you’re staring at the ones with Jessica in them?”  “To stare” (stare) means to look at  something for a long time, without looking at anything else.  Normally, it’s considered impolite or rude to stare at someone, even if you find that person attra ctive.  Jorge is staring at the picture, however, not at an actual person.  In part icular, he’s staring at a woman by the name of Jessica.

Maya says, “I think you’ve got a crush on her.”  A “crush” (cr ush) is a feeling of liking someone romantically.  Usually we use this word in t alking about children or teenagers; when they say they like someone, we say they h ave a crush on them – someone they’re interested in romantically to the  extent that children have actual romantic feelings, that is the word we woul d use, a crush.  So, Maya’s using it sort of as a joke here, because Jorge is o bviously not a child. Jorge says, “I’m not 10 years old.  I don’t get crushes.”  The word “crush” actually has a couple of different meanings, so take a look at the  Learning Guide – you know, for some additional explanations.

Maya says, “Then, I think you’re falling head over heels f or her.”  This expression, “to fall head over heels” (heels), is one to d escribe someone falling in love with another person, to have very strong feelings of love and affection,

 especially at the very beginning when you first start to li ke someone.  Someone who falls head over heels is someone who falls in love some what quickly.  Your “heels” are the bottom of your feet, so to fall head over heels would mean sort of like falling down because you’re so much in love with this person.  Which can be kind of painful, both the falling down and the love p art!

Jorge says, “Don’t be ridiculous.  I’ve only just met her.”  Maya says, “I knew it was love at first sight when I introduced you at Yannick’s p arty.”  The expression “love at first sight” (sight) means you fall in love with  someone the first time you see them.  You see a beautiful woman on the other side  of the room and you fall in love with her, that’s love at first sight.  That’s wh at happened with me and my wife actually.  It was love at first sight – well, for m e.  She didn’t even notice I was in the room, but from my perspective, it was love at fir st sight!

Well, Maya introduced Jorge and Jessica at a party recent ly.  Maya says that she could see the sparks fly.  The expression “sparks (sparks) fly” me ans that there was an obvious romantic connection between the two.  A “sp ark,” technically, is what happens, for example, if you were to take a match and strike it against a stone; it might create a spark.  You’ll see a small part icle flying off, usually with a bright light.  That’s a spark.  A spark can also mean, as i n this case, a connection between two people – a romantic connection.

So, Maya says she could see sparks fly, she could see that they w ere falling in love with each other.  Maya says, “I couldn’t miss her blu sh or your silly grin.” “To miss” means not to notice, not to see.  So when Maya  says, “I couldn’t miss,” she means it was obvious to me that she was blushing and you had a silly grin. “To blush” means that your cheeks change color, usually to  pink or red, either because you’re embarrassed or perhaps because you’re angry.  A woman might blush if you give her a compliment, if she’s embarrassed b y it.  Perhaps she thinks it’s too much; perhaps she knows you’re trying to exp ress your romantic interest.  A “grin” (grin) is a small smile of happine ss, usually without showing your teeth.

So, Jorge was happy and Jessica was blushing because, perhaps,  of something that Jorge said.  Maya insists that there was certainly a lot of chemistry between the two of you.  “Chemistry,” in this context, means a r omantic attraction between two people, where each person is interested in the othe r.  He likes her, and she likes him.  Sometimes if you’re watching a movie, and you see that there’s a couple in a movie who are supposed to be in love with ea ch other, but it doesn’t really seem by their acting that they’re in love with ea ch other, we might say they don’t have any chemistry.  There’s no obvious romantic conn ection with their characters – with their acting, in this case.

 Jorge says, “I hardly talked to her at the party.”  “I har dly” means very little; I didn’t talk to her very much.  Maya says, “Yes, but I could  see her stealing glances at you all night.”  A “glance” (glance) is a quick look at someone.  We use the expression, “to steal a glance,” meaning that you look at someone quickly without them noticing that you are looking at t hem.  This usually indicates that perhaps they’re interested in you.  “To steal,” her e, means to do it without the other person noticing.

Jorge says, “That must have been a figment of your imagin ation.”  The expression “to be a figment (figment) of your imaginat ion” means that it’s something that you made up, something that you invented,  something you imagined that’s not real – not true.  Maya says, “Oh, r eally?”  Jorge says, “Okay (now he confesses), I won’t deny that I’m attracted to Je ssica, but I can’t speak for her.”  He says, “I won’t deny,” meaning I will tel l you the truth – I won’t say it isn’t true; I am attracted to Jessica.  “Attracted to” mea ns that you like someone, you think you’re interested in them in a romantic way.  You haven’t necessarily fallen in love with them yet, but you’re attracted to  them.  You can be attracted to someone who isn’t your romantic interest, someone you see i n the movie or someone you see walking down the street.  Many times you’l l feel some sort of physical attraction for that person, and if you’re single , you may then go up and talk to that person – probably not, if you’re like me.  But I’m not single so it’s not a concern for me, is it?

Jorge says that he can’t speak for her, meaning for Jessica.  “To speak for (someone)” means to speak on behalf of another person, to give the other person’s ideas or opinions.  This is often necessary if the p erson isn’t there; you may talk to them and you agree on some things, and then you go to a meeting and you say, “Well, I’m going to speak for Billy,” “I’m g oing to speak for Laura,” these are her ideas – her opinions.  Hopefully, she’s give n you permission to speak for her.  Of course, you don’t want to speak for some one who didn’t give you permission to do so.

Well, Jorge says he can’t speak for Jessica, meaning he doesn ’t know if Jessica is attracted to him.  Maya says, “Yes, but I can,” meaning I can speak for Jessica, and Jorge, surprised, says, “What?”  Maya says, “Jessica asked me about you.” Jorge asks, “When?”  Maya says, “Yesterday, at lunch.”  Perha ps Jessica works in the same office.  Jorge says, “What did she say?”  He, of  course, is now very interested.  He also asks, “What did you  say (Maya)?”  Maya says, somewhat jokingly, “That’s for me to know and for you to find out !”  This phrase is used when you have some secret information, but you don’t wa nt to share it – you don’t want to give it to another person.  You want to  sort of tease that person.

 That is, make them uncomfortable by telling them that  you’re not going to tell them the information.  “That’s for me to know and for  you to find out,” meaning I’m not going to tell you, and you’re sort of making no t exactly fun of the other person, but you are exercising a certain control – a certai n power over the situation because you have this secret information.

So that’s the story of Jorge and Jessica.  Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Maya:  What are those?

Jorge:  They’re pictures from our ski trip last weekend.

Maya:  Is there any reason you’re staring at the ones with  Jessica in them?  I think you’ve got a crush on her.

Jorge:  I’m not 10 years old.  I don’t get crushes.

Maya:  Then, I think you’re falling head over heels for her.

Jorge:  Don’t be ridiculous.  I’ve only just met her.

Maya:  I knew it was love at first sight when I introduced  you at Yannick’s party.  I could see the sparks fly.  I couldn’t miss her blush or your silly grin.  There was certainly a lot of chemistry between the two of you, that ’s for sure.

Jorge:  I hardly talked to her at the party.

Maya:  Yes, but I could see her stealing glances at you al l night.

Jorge:  That must have been a figment of your imaginati on.

Maya:  Oh, really?

Jorge:  Okay, I won’t deny that I’m attracted to Jessica, b ut I can’t speak for her.

Maya:  Yes, but I can.

Jorge:  What?

 Maya:  She asked me about you.

Jorge:  When?

Maya:  Yesterday, at lunch.

Jorge:  What did she say?  What did you  say?

Maya:  That’s for me to know and for you to find out!

# Talking About Age

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 26: Talking About Age.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 526.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Talking About Age.”  It’s dialogu e between Gabby and Cherif.  It’s going to be using a lot of vocabulary that  we use to describe how old someone is.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Gabby:  Another birthday!  I’m going to stop celebrati ng.  What’s there to celebrate – getting old and decrepit?

Cherif:  Are you kidding me?  We’re in the prime of o ur lives.  Who’s decrepit? I’m not.

Gabby:  If I’m in my prime, then why do I feel so middl e age?

Cherif:  It’s a matter of perspective.  It’s true that we’re not spring chickens anymore, but who wants all of the angst of youth?  Not me.  I like living these mature years without the insecurity and uncertainty of you th.

Gabby:  It’s not that.  I don’t miss the awkwardness of my teenage years, and I definitely don’t miss the struggles I had to go through  in my 20s.  What I miss is the excitement of seeing and experiencing things for the  first time.  If I’m nostalgic, then I’m nostalgic for the innocence of youth.

Cherif:  Come on.  There’s nothing stopping you from seeing and trying new things now.  Don’t tell me that you’ve seen and done ev erything.

Gabby:  No, I haven’t.

 Cherif:  Then you’ll come with me next Saturday, and I guarantee you a new experience.

Gabby:  What new experience?

Cherif:  Have you ever tried skydiving?

Gabby:  No, I haven’t and I don’t plan to now.  I may be old, but I’m not ready to kick the bucket yet!

[end of dialogue]

Gabby begins by saying to Cherif, “Another birthday!  I’ m going to stop celebrating.  What’s there to celebrate – getting old and decrepit?”  Gabby is obviously not too happy because it’s her birthday.  She doe sn’t want to celebrate – she doesn’t want to have a party or be happy because t here’s nothing to be happy about.  She says, “What’s there to celebrate – get ting old and decrepit?” “Decrepit” (decrepit) means when someone is getting ver y old, or something is getting very old and it stops working or it is falling ap art, we would say that it’s decrepit.  This old bookcase I have that holds all of my b ooks, it’s old and decrepit, it’s starting to fall down.

Cherif says, “Are you kidding me?  We’re in the prime of  our lives.”  “To be in the prime (prime) of your life” means to be living in the best period of your life, when you’re happy and healthy and having fun.  To be in the prime of your life means to be in the best years of your life.  Gabby says, “If I’ m in my prime, then why do I feel so middle age?”  “Middle age” depends on the cou ntry and the period of history you’re in.  Nowadays, middle age is someone who’s not young but not old, maybe between 45 and 55 or 40 and 60.  It depen ds on how old you are, whether you think you’re middle age.  I think I’m defin itely middle age!

Cherif says, “It’s a matter of perspective.”  “Perspective,” here, means it’s a matter of the way you look at things, your point of view .  This is a common expression: “it’s a matter of perspective,” meaning it’s an  issue of perspective. Cherif says, “It’s true that we’re not spring chickens anymor e.”  A “spring chicken” is an informal term, sort of an old-fashioned term for  a young person.  Cherif is probably using it here to be sort of funny, because we d on’t hear that expression very often.  But a spring chicken would be a young chicken –  a young person. He says, “who wants all of the angst of youth?  Not me.”  “Angst” (angst) is when you’re worried, when you’re uncertain.  You don’t know what’s going to happen next, so you feel uncomfortable; that’s angst.  He says he doesn’t want the angst of youth, “I like living these mature years without the insecurity and uncertainty of

 youth.”  If we’re describing someone as “mature,” here i t means someone who is an adult, someone is grown up and no longer a child.  “Maturity” has a couple of different meanings – the word “mature.”  Take a look a t the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Cherif says that living in these mature years, he doesn’t have insecurity and uncertainty.  “To be insecure” means to be not secure.  In English, sometimes we put the word “in” in front of a word to mean “not,”  sometimes we put the letters “un” – technically, the prefix “un” in front of a word to mean “not,” it depends on the word.  This word is “insecurity,” it means not feeli ng secure; in this case, not knowing how to act, not having confidence.  “Uncertaint y” means not certain, meaning you don’t know what’s going to happen next.  Yo u don’t know what you should do, how you should live your life; this would be u ncertainty.  So, being mature means not being insecure and not being uncertai n, or secure and certain.

Gabby says, “It’s not that,” meaning that’s not why she fee ls sad.  She says, “I don’t miss the awkwardness of my teenage years.”  “Awkwardne ss” is a feeling of being uncomfortable, of not knowing what to say, per haps not knowing what to do with your body.  People who are teenagers, someone between the ages of 13 and 19, often are sometimes awkward; they’re uncomfortab le, their body is growing, they may not feel comfortable in the way they talk or the way they look. This is not uncommon for teenagers.  Gabby says she doesn’t  miss the awkwardness of her teenage years – notice we use it as an a djective to mean the time I was a teenager.  She says, “I definitely don’ t miss the struggles I had to go through in my 20s.  What I miss is the excitement of see ing and experiencing things for the first time.”  She says, “If I’m nostalgic,  then I’m nostalgic for the innocence of youth.”  “To be nostalgic” (nostalgic) means  to remember things from your past and wishing, perhaps, that you could do th ose things again or experience those things again.  I’m sometimes nostalgic for  the years that I was in graduate school, when I was studying for my degree aft er I finished my bachelor’s degree.  It seemed to be, now, a wonderful time, although when I was there, at that time, hmm, not so much.  But now that I’m older, I think, “Oh, those were wonderful years.”  Actually, I think these are wonde rful years, too, so I’m not that nostalgic.  Well, Gabby says she’s nostalgic for the innocence of youth. “Innocence” is a state where you may not know very much abo ut the real world – about the bad things that happen in the world.  We o ften think of young children as being in an “age of innocence.”  “Innocent” has many d ifferent meanings, and you know where to go to find out those meanings.  The L earning Guide, that’s right!

Cherif says, “Come on.  There’s nothing stopping you fro m seeing and trying new things now.  “Come on” is here used to mean don’t be si lly or that’s not the right

 view.  He says, “Don’t tell me that you’ve seen and done e verything.”  Cherif is saying there’s lots of new things in life to experience.  Gabby says, “No, I haven’t.”  Cherif then says, “Then you’ll come with me ne xt Saturday, and I guarantee you a new experience.”  Cherif is going to show Gabby something she has not experienced before.  Gabby says, “What new experi ence?”  Cherif says, “Have you ever tried skydiving?”  “Skydiving” is when you jump  out of an airplane with a “parachute,” which is a large piece of fabric – of material that helps you slow down your fall.  To parachute out of a plane mean s to jump out of a plane as it’s high above the ground, and then you have your pa rachute that helps you come down to the ground slowly.  We also call that skydivin g.

Gabby says, “No, I haven’t and I don’t plan to now,” me aning I don’t plan to skydive now.  “I may be old,” she says, “but I’m not ready to  kick the bucket yet!” The expression “to kick the bucket” means to die, to pass away,  to no longer be living.  She’s making a joke here, saying that if she trie d skydiving she could kill herself, and she’s not ready to die – she’s not ready to ki ck the bucket.  It’s an informal expression.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Gabby:  Another birthday!  I’m going to stop celebrati ng.  What’s there to celebrate – getting old and decrepit?

Cherif:  Are you kidding me?  We’re in the prime of o ur lives.  Who’s decrepit? I’m not.

Gabby:  If I’m in my prime, then why do I feel so middl e age?

Cherif:  It’s a matter of perspective.  It’s true that we’re not spring chickens anymore, but who wants all of the angst of youth?  Not me.  I like living these mature years without the insecurity and uncertainty of you th.

Gabby:  It’s not that.  I don’t miss the awkwardness of my teenage years, and I definitely don’t miss the struggles I had to go through  in my 20s.  What I miss is the excitement of seeing and experiencing things for the  first time.  If I’m nostalgic, then I’m nostalgic for the innocence of youth.

Cherif:  Come on.  There’s nothing stopping you from seeing and trying new things now.  Don’t tell me that you’ve seen and done ev erything.

 Gabby:  No, I haven’t.

Cherif:  Then you’ll come with me next Saturday, and I guarantee you a new experience.

Gabby:  What new experience?

Cherif:  Have you ever tried skydiving?

Gabby:  No, I haven’t and I don’t plan to now.  I may be old, but I’m not ready to kick the bucket yet!

# Describing Men¡¦s Bodies

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 27: Describing Men’s Bodies.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 527.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Lea rning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural  notes, and a complete transcript of this episode.

This episode is called “Describing Men’s Bodies.”  It’s a di alogue between Justin and Katrina talking about the way that men and women look at their bodies. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Justin:  What are you ogling at?

Katrina:  I’m watching those guys working across the street .

Justin:  Those construction workers?

Katrina:  Yeah, those prime examples of manhood.  The re’s not a flabby gut in the bunch.

Justin:  I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t appreciate you watch ing them as though they were pieces of meat.  Hasn’t anyone ever told you no t to objectify the opposite sex?

Katrina:  What?  I’m not objectifying anybody.  I’m just  admiring their six-packs and guns.  Look at those long, lean bodies.

Justin:  Stop it!  It’s demeaning, and on behalf of a ll men out there, I’m really offended.  It’s disgusting.

Katrina:  Is it disgusting to have a picture of Megan F ox on the wall in your office?

Justin:  That’s different!

Justin:  It’s her personality I admire.

Katrina:  You could’ve fooled me.

[end of dialogue]

Justin begins by saying to Katrina, “What are you ogling a t?”  “To ogle (ogle) (someone),” or “to ogle at (someone)” means to look a t someone in a way that shows that you are interested in them, possibly even sexuall y interested in them. It’s usually something that someone doesn’t want you to do .  Often it’s done with someone you don’t know, but it could be someone you know  as well.  You don’t want your college professor ogling at his female student s, for example.

Katrina say s, “I’m watching those guys working across the street.”  So, Katrina is looking at some men, presumably attractive men, who are w orking across the street from where she is.  Justin says, “Those construction wo rkers?”  A “construction worker” is a person whose job it is to hel p build new buildings or roads or bridges, someone who works outdoors, someone who does physical labor – physical work, building or constructing something.  “To construct” means to build, so we have “construction workers.”

Katrina says , “Yeah, those prime examples of manhood.”  Something  that is “prime” is something that is the best.  So, a “prime exa mple” would be a perfect or very good example of something.  During the 1980s, I  was a prime example of what my father used to call a “professional student.”  That’s sort of a joking term; someone who’s a professional student is someone who stays in school, usually college, for a very long time.  I was in school for almost  eight years finishing my bachelor’s degree, which is normally finishe d in four.  I’m not too smart, you see! So, I became a professional student.  It’s a long story; I ’ll tell you some other time.

Getting back to our dialogue, Katrina says those men – th ose construction workers are “prime examples of manhood.”  “Manhood” is the characteristics of a man, usually someone who is strong, someone who’s responsibl e.  “Manhood” can refer also to the physical attractiveness, perhaps, of a man.  Katrina seems more interested in the physical features, or physical aspect s of these men.  She says, “There’s not a flabby (flabby) gut (gut) in the bun ch.”  “To be flabby” means to have too much fat.  If your arms are flabby, they have a lot of fat on them, and if you move them quickly you may see the fat move.  That’s to  be flabby.  A “gut”

These materials are copyrighted by the Center for Ed ucational Development (2009).  Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited. 7 is another word for your stomach, the middle part of your body in front of your body – or rather, in the front part of your body.  You r stomach, what we would sometimes call your “tummy,” this is the gut, this is the middle part of your body. The word “ gut” has a couple of different meanings in English; ta ke a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  To s ay someone has a “flabby gut” means that perhaps they’ve been drinking too much b eer, they’ve been eating too many doughnuts or McDonalds hamburgers, and t hey have a lot of fat in front in their stomach area.  A “bunch” means a gro up of people or a group of things.  So, Katrina says, “There’s not a flabby gut in the bunch.”  She means that none of the men have a flabby gut, meaning they’r e in good physical condition.

Justin says, “I’m pretty sure that they wouldn’t appreciate you watching them as though they were pieces of meat.”  Justin is saying that t hese men, if they knew that Katrina was looking at them just for their physical aspect – just for their physical appearance, would not appreciate it; they would not want that to happen.  That’s what Justin says!  “Pieces of meat” is an exp ression here to mean only for the physical aspect – only for the physical beauty of someone.  It’s a negative way of describing this.  We don’t want to l ook at people as though they were pieces of meat; they’re human beings with perso nalities, and minds, and so forth.  But, Justin is saying that that’s the way K atrina is looking at these men.  Justin says, “Hasn’t anyone ever told you not to obje ctify the opposite sex?”  “To objectify” (objectify) means to treat a person – a human being as though they were an object; as though they were just a p hysical thing, and not referring or not being concerned about their personal ity – who they were inside, and so forth.

Now, there’s a little bit of a switch – a little bit of a reversal happening here; things are a little backwards than they would normally be .  Normally, we think about men objectifying women, looking at women just for  their physical beauty. Here, we have Katrina looking at the men and objectif ying them, making them as though they were just physical objects.  The “opposite sex” would be whatever you’re not, so if you’re a man, the opposite sex would be  a woman; if you’re a woman, the opposite sex would be a man.

So, Justin says, “Hasn’t anyone ever told you not to objecti fy the opposite sex?” – not to do that.  Katrina says, “What?  I’m not object ifying anybody.  I’m just admiring their six-packs and guns.  Look at those long, lean bodies.”  Katrina uses a couple of different informal expressions in describin g a man’s body: The first one is a “six-pack.”  A “six-pack” normally refers to a  way of buying beer, where you buy six cans of beer and they’re held together b y a plastic strap.  This is called a “six-pack.”  But here, the word – or expression  “six-pack” refers to the

These materials are copyrighted by the Center for Ed ucational Development (2009).  Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited. 8 abdominal muscles of a man who is very healthy, very athleti c, very strong. “Abdominal” refers, once again, to the stomach – the stomach area, and if you have a very strong man who exercises his abdominal muscles you ca n see the six muscles under the skin, which is considered to be very healt hy, very athletic looking.  So, a man’s six-pack would be his abdominal muscl es that were in good shape – good condition.  Even though we normally use the  word “six-pack” to refer to beer, if you drink a lot of six-packs you probabl y won’t have a six-pack. That is, if you drink a lot of beer, you won’t have tho se abdominal muscles showing.  “Guns,” here, means the biceps, which are the large muscles in your upper arm.  They’re between your elbow and your shoulde r, and if you take your arm and you put it at a 90-degree angle – at a right  angle – and you stress your muscles, you will see your biceps.  And of course, for a man  to have big biceps is to be considered, usually, more attractive.  Arnold Schwar zenegger, our government, has big biceps – although I’m not sure he’s a ttractive!  “Lean” means with very little fat.  Someone who doesn’t have a  lot of fat on their body is lean.  We also talk about pieces of meat, such as beef, be ing lean, not having a lot of fat on them.  So, Katrina says that she’s admirin g the men’s six-packs and guns.  “Guns” has a couple of different meanings however;  take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  “Gun s” is also a pretty informal expression; it would probably be used more as a joke than anything else.

Katrina says, “Look at those long, lean bodies.”  Justin sa ys, “Stop it!  It’s demeaning, and on behalf of all men out there, I’m really offended.  It’s disgusting.”  Something that is “demeaning” is somethin g that is embarrassing or shameful, something that is showing less respect to the ot her person than they should.  To be “demeaning” to  someone means not to treat them with respect. Justin says it’s demeaning to look at men that way, “and on  behalf of all men out there, I’m really offended.”  “On behalf of” means spe aking for a larger group of people, representing, in this case, all men.  That’s wh at Justin is trying to do here.  He says, “I’m really offended,” meaning he’s insu lted; he’s angered by something that someone has said or done.  Of course, most men would not be offended if a woman looked at him and thought that h e was attractive, but again, there’s a little bit of a reversal going on here.  Justi n says, “It’s disgusting.” Something that’s “disgusting” is something that is unatt ractive, unpleasant, makes you feel uncomfortable or dirty, something that is g ross.  All of these would be ways of describing “disgusting.”  It’s a very negat ive way of describing something.  If you go to a restaurant and you say, “Oh, the soup was disgusting,” that means it was absolutely terrible, it was horrible;  the worst you’ve ever had, perhaps.

Katrina says, “Is it disgusting to have a picture of Megan Fox on the wall in your office?”  She’s talking to Justin, who has a picture of a  famous actress, someone

These materials are copyrighted by the Center for Ed ucational Development (2009).  Posting of these materials on another website or distributing them in any way is prohibited. 9 who’s very – considered by some men, not me – sexually attract ive, a woman by the name of Megan Fox.  Well, Justin has a picture of t his woman on the wall in his office.  Katrina is saying that, well, Justin does exact ly what he says Katrina should not do.

Justin says, “That’s different!”  Katrina says, “How (how is it different)?”  Justin says, “It’s her personality I admire.”  “Personality” is one ’s character, the way one treats other people, the way one talks to other people,  the way you think about things; all of these are part of your personality.  Of course, Justin here is really making a joke, because he doesn’t have a picture of her if he admires her personality, he has a picture of her because he thinks tha t she’s attractive.

Katrina says, “You could’ve fooled me.”  “The expression “yo u could’ve fooled me” is a sarcastic phrase used when you don’t really believe  what someone else says.  Someone says, “I really love going to the dentist,” w hen you know that person hates going to the dentist, you could say, “Oh we ll, you could’ve fooled me.  It looks like you had a horrible time at the dent ist last year.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Justin:  What are you ogling at?

Katrina:  I’m watching those guys working across the street.

Justin:  Those construction workers?

# Negotiating Salary

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 28: Negotiating Salary.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 528.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Negotiating Salary.”  It’s a dial ogue between Renaldo and Simone.  They’re going to be talking about someone who  may be interested in taking a job, but they first want to get a good salary (“salary” being the money that you’re paid for your job).  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Renaldo:  Hello, may I speak to Simone Otto?

Simone:  This is Simone.  May I ask who’s calling?

Renaldo:  This is Renaldo Garcia at Cinetect.  You int erviewed for a position with me last week.

Simone:  Oh, yes, of course.  How are you?

Renaldo:  I’m doing well.  The reason I’m calling is t hat I was very impressed with you last week, and I’d like to offer you the job.

Simone:  Thank you very much.  I’m delighted to hear it .  I really appreciate the job offer.

Renaldo:  I think we now need to talk about salary.  What are your salary requirements?

Simone:  Well, for this type of position, I would be l ooking for a salary range between $60,000 and $65,000.

 Renaldo:  Hmm, that’s a bit higher than I was thinkin g, given our budget constraints.  Perhaps we can give you an attractive compensat ion package if the salary isn’t quite what you’re looking for.

Simone:  I’m certainly open to negotiations, though I think that the salary range I named is comparable to that of similar positions in the field.

Renaldo:  All right.  Why don’t you consider this:  I can  give you a salary of $50,000 and I’ll increase your annual vacation time from  two weeks to three weeks.

Simone:  Hmm, I’ll need to think about that…

Renaldo:  In this economy, it’s a salary that many people  would jump at.

Simone:  I understand that, but I also know that I have  a lot to offer your company.

Renaldo:  That’s certainly true, and I don’t you to wal k away from this job if there’s any way we can close the gap in salary.

Simone:  If you’re willing to up the offer to $60,00 0, then I think it may be doable.

Renaldo:  Well, $60,000 is really the ceiling for that  position.  I’ll have to give it some thought and call you back.

Simone:  Please do, and again, thank you very much for the offer.  It would be an honor to work with you and to work at Cinetect.

[end of dialogue]

Our phone conversation begins with Renaldo saying, “Hello , may I speak to Simone Otto?”  Simone says, “This is Simone.  May I ask wh o’s calling?”  That’s a somewhat formal way when someone calls you but doesn’t i dentify themselves first; you’re asking them to tell you who they are. Renal do says, “This is Renaldo Garcia at Cinetect,” the name of his company or the compa ny where he works. He says, “You interviewed for a position with me last wee k.”  So, Simone wants to get a job at Cinetect and Renaldo is calling her a fter the interview.  “To interview” means to have a meeting with that person, wh ere they ask questions and you give answers about your qualifications for the jo b.

 Simone says, “Oh, yes, of course.  How are you?”  Renaldo  says, “I’m doing well. The reason I’m calling is that I was very impressed with you  last week, and I’d like to offer you the job (I would like to say this job is yours if you want it).” Simone says, “Thank you very much.  I’m delighted to hear it.”  This is a somewhat formal way of saying I’m very happy hear that new s; I’m very happy to find out that you are offering me, in this case, a job.   Simone says, “I really appreciate the job offer.”  The “job offer” is when t hey say either by telling you or by writing you that we are offering you a job; we are saying you can have this job if you want it.

Renaldo says, “I think we now need to talk about salary,” the amount of money that you’re paid.  “Salary” is the amount of money that  you’re paid in a year, regardless of how many hours you work.  There are two wa ys of being paid.  One is with a salary, where you get paid a certain amount of money even if you work 10 hours a day.  The other way of getting paid is a wa ge (wage).  A “wage” is when you are paid usually by the hour; so the more hours you work the more you’re paid.  In the United States, most professional positions (administrative positions) are by salary, not by the hour.  Hourly wages are usually for jobs that perhaps don’t require the same level of education as a professional job does, but that’s not always the case.

Renaldo asks Simone, “What are your salary requirements ( what is the amount of money that you need and expect from this job)?”  Sim one says, “Well, for this type of position (for this kind of job), I would be loo king for a salary range between $60,000 and $65,000.”  “I would be looking” is just a slightly more formal way of saying I am looking for a salary range.  A “range ” is the highest and lowest amount of something.  In this case, the salary rang e is the lowest amount that she would accept to the highest amount that you coul d expect.  She, of course, would take a higher salary, we guess.  But the sala ry range would be the average salary, the salary that would be typical for a job like this.

Renaldo says, “Hmm, that’s a bit higher than I was thinki ng,” meaning it’s more money than he thought the new employee, Simone, shoul d be paid.  He says, “given our budget constraints.”  “Given” means taking into  consideration “our budget (or financial) constraints.  A “constraint” is somet hing that limits what you can do.  Renaldo is saying here, basically, we don’t have e nough money in our budget (in the plan that we have for the money we’re going to spend) to pay the salary that you want.  He says, “Perhaps we can give you a n attractive compensation package if the salary isn’t quite what you’re looking for.”  A “compensation package” would be a combination of all the things that you get in exchange for working at your job.  So this would include health insurance, vacation days, retirement money (money for when you stop w orking); those

 would all be part of a compensation package.  The word “compensation” is just another word for what you received by doing something; by working there, you receive money plus all these other things.

Simone says, “I’m certainly open to negotiations.”  “To b e open to (something)” means that you are willing to do something.  “Negotiat ions” is when you sit down with someone and you talk about a difference that you h ave, and to try to come to some common agreement.  Perhaps one person gives up som ething, you give up something; you compromise, you negotiate.  “Negotiat ions” is the noun from the verb “to negotiate.”  Simone says she’s open to negot iations, “though I think that the salary range I named is comparable to that of  similar positions in the field.”  “To be comparable” means to be similar, someth ing that you can compare, with the same characteristics.  She’s saying that t he salary range she gave Renaldo, 60 to $65,000, is similar to other jobs ( similar jobs) in that field (in that type of work, whatever it is).

Renaldo says, “All right.  Why don’t you consider (why don’ t you think about) this: I can give you a salary of $50,000 and I’ll increase your a nnual vacation time from two weeks to three weeks.”  “To increase” means to g ive more vacation days.  “Annual” is every year.  Typically in the U.S., in jo bs you get between maybe two to four weeks of vacation every year, it depends o n the job.  Typical is two weeks, not like in other countries where you may get four or five weeks. Typically it’s less here in the U.S. than in some other co untries.

So, Simone says, “Hmm, I’ll need to think about that.”  Renaldo says, “In this economy, it’s a salary that many people would jump at.”  “To jump at,” here, means to decide to do something immediately, without t hinking before making your decision because it’s so good, it’s so attractive.  Rena ldo is saying that with difficult economic times, this is a good salary and other p eople would take it immediately.  This, of course, is a kind of psychological pr essure that he’s trying to put on Simone, trying to force her, maybe make her f eel even a little guilty that she’s asking for a higher salary.  This is, of course, part of the negotiation process.  The word “jump” has a couple of different mean ings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.

Simone says, “I understand that (meaning I understand it  is a good salary), but I also know that I have a lot to offer your company.”  Ren aldo says, “That’s certainly true, and I don’t you to walk away from this jo b if there’s any way we can close the gap in salary.”  “To walk away,” here, mean s to say no to something.  It doesn’t mean literally to walk in the op posite direction, although it could mean that.  But in this context, it means to say no,  to say, “No, thank you.  I don’t want this position,” and that’s the end of it.  Renaldo is trying to close the

 gap.  “To close the gap” means to somehow compromise, ne gotiate so that we can find something we both agree on.  Maybe not 50,000 , maybe not 60,000, perhaps 55,000; where one person goes up and the other  person goes down, and they can agree on something.  A “gap” is a space in b etween two things.  In this case it’s the distance, if you will, the difference in  the amount of money that Simone wants and Renaldo is offering her.

Simone says, “If you’re willing to up the offer to $60, 000, then I think it may be doable.”  “To up,” here, means to increase.  “Up” is u sed as a verb, to make something bigger or louder; in this case, to increase the salary.  “If you’re willing to up the offer (meaning what you are offering me) t o $60,000, then I think,” she says, “it may be doable,” meaning I can do it.  Renaldo says, “Well, $60,000 is really the ceiling for that position.”  The “ceiling” i s the maximum or highest amount that you, in this case, will pay somebody.  “Ceili ng” has other meanings in English; the Learning Guide will give you some more  explanations about those.

Renaldo says, “I’ll have to give it some thought and call you back,” meaning I’ll have to think about it.  “To give (something) some tho ught” means to think about it.  Simone says, “Please do, and again, thank you very mu ch for the offer.  It would be an honor to work with you and to work at Cine tect.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Renaldo:  Hello, may I speak to Simone Otto?

Simone:  This is Simone.  May I ask who’s calling?

Renaldo:  This is Renaldo Garcia at Cinetect.  You int erviewed for a position with me last week.

Simone:  Oh, yes, of course.  How are you?

Renaldo:  I’m doing well.  The reason I’m calling is t hat I was very impressed with you last week, and I’d like to offer you the job.

Renaldo:  That’s certainly true, and I don’t you to wal k away from this job if there’s any way we can close the gap in salary.

Simone:  If you’re willing to up the offer to $60,00 0, then I think it may be doable.

Renaldo:  Well, $60,000 is really the ceiling for that  position.  I’ll have to give it some thought and call you back.

Simone:  Please do, and again, thank you very much for the offer.  It would be an honor to work with you and to work at Cinetect.

This episode is called “Insulting Other People.”  It’s a dialogue between Lourdes and Nick, and we’re going to be using a lot of vocabular y of related to…well…insulting people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lourdes:  Do you see those teenagers over there?  They’r e making trouble again.

Nick:  Those kids are just messing around.  When they get bored, they’ll pipe down and go home.

Lourdes:  They’re really getting on my nerves, playing lo ud music and making all that noise.  They’re a disgrace.

Nick:  Get away from that window before they see you.  If  they see that they can’t get a rise out of us, they’ll move along.  What are you doing?  What are you planning to do with that broom?

Lourdes:  I’m going to use it to wave them off.

Nick:  I wouldn’t do that if I were you.  Teenagers can  be unpredictable.  You don’t know if a small slight might set them off.  Insult  them and you’re asking for trouble.

Lourdes:  I don’t care.  I’m doing it anyway.

Nick:  Great!  Now you have their attention.  They’re f lipping us off!

 Lourdes:  Yeah, well, two can play that game.  Take tha t!

Nick:  Are you crazy?!

Lourdes:  No, I’m just giving as good as I get.  Look wh at they’re doing now!

Nick:  They’re mooning us!

Lourdes:  Well, two can play that game, too!

Nick:  What?!  Are you nuts?!  You can’t moon them back.

Lourdes:  Oh, no?  Watch me!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Lourdes saying, “Do you see tho se teenagers over there?  They’re making trouble again.”  They’re causing trouble; they’re causing problems.  Nick says, “Those kids are just messing around.”  “T o mess (mess) around” means to do unimportant things, perhaps to ha ve fun because you have nothing else to do, to be wasting your time doing silly things; this is messing around.  Sometimes people will say, “Stop messing around ,” meaning stop wasting your time or stop making jokes perhaps.  Messing ar ound is usually considered harmless; that is, it isn’t necessarily bothering or hurting anyone, or at least you don’t intend (you don’t try) to do that.  Nick says, “When the teenagers get bored, they’ll pipe down and go home.”  “To pipe  (pipe) down” is another two- word phrasal verb meaning to be quiet, to stop making n oise.  This is something I’m sure my father often said to those of us in the backyar d of our house, playing. There were many of us, of course.  He would perhaps say,  “Pipe down out there!”  The word “pipe” has a couple of different me anings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lourdes says that these teenagers are really getting on h er nerves.  “To get on (someone’s) nerves” means to annoy or bother someone, to d o something that will make someone angry or mad.  Lourdes says playing loud music and making all that noise is getting on her nerves.  “They’re a disg race.”  A “disgrace” (disgrace) is something that is very bad, something that i s unacceptable, something that you cannot approve of; we might even use t he word “shameful.” That’s a disgrace.  She’s saying these teenagers are a disg race.  It’s a rather strong word to criticize someone.

 Nick says, “Get away from that window before they see you.”   Lourdes is obviously looking out the window of their house at these  teenagers playing outside.  Nick says, “If they see that they can’t get a rise out of us, they’ll move along.”  “To get a rise out of (someone)” means to ge t an angry reaction from someone, to make someone respond in a certain way.  Usual ly, someone is trying to make you angry; they’re trying to get a rise out  of you – they’re trying to get a response from you.  Nick says if the teenagers see th at they are not bothering us – that they can’t get a rise out of us – t hen they’ll leave.  They’ll move along; go somewhere else.  Nick then says, “What are you doing?  What are you planning to do with that broom?”  A “broom” is what you use to clean the floors.  It has a long, usually wooden handle (a stick), a nd on the bottom are the things that you use to clean the floor; we would say “to  sweep the floor.”

Apparently, Lourdes has a broom in her hand, and Nick is asking what she’s going to do with it.  Lourdes says, “I’m going to use it  to wave them off.”  “To wave (someone) off” means to usually move your hand in the air to show that you want that person to leave (to go away).  She’s goin g to use the broom to get the children to leave (to go somewhere else).

Nick says, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” meaning if  I were in your position I would not do that, it’s not a good idea.  “Teenagers, ” he says, “can be unpredictable.”  They may act in ways that you don’t expect.   “You don’t know if a small slight might set them off.”  A “slight” is a rude or disrespectful criticism, something that you say really to make the other person an gry.  “Slight” has a couple of different meanings however; that’s just one of them.  The rest of them are found in our Learning Guide, where you can get so me more explanations.

So, Nick is telling her that you don’t want to insult or  anger these teenagers because that might set them off.  “To set (someone) off”  is another two-word verb meaning to make someone very angry, to cause someone to do something out of anger.  He says, “Insult them and you’re asking for troubl e.”  “To insult (someone)” is to offend someone; that is, to do or say som ething that makes the other person angry and shows that you don’t have respect for them.  So it’s a very severe, often personal criticism.  The verb is “to in sult,” the noun is “ insult,” a difference in the way that we stress the different sylla bles.  She is going to insult these teenagers, Nick believes, and he says that Lourdes is a sking for trouble. “To ask for trouble” means to do something even though you know it’s going to create problems or make another person angry.  Usually we  try to avoid causing problems.

He’s saying that Lourdes is asking for trouble, she can expect  there to be more problems if she does this.  Lourdes says, “I don’t care.  I’ m doing it anyway.”

 Nick says, “Great!  Now you have their attention,” meaning  now they’re paying attention to you.  “They’re flipping us off!”  “To fli p (someone) off” is, in an American context, to use your middle finger to insult some one.  It’s a very vulgar, very insulting gesture, a way of using your hands to insult someone.  That’s to flip someone off.

Lourdes says, “well, two can play at that game.”  “Two can play at that game” is an expression that we use to show that if someone does som ething mean or bad to you, you’re going to do something mean or bad to th em.  This, of course, is not usually a good idea, but some people when they get angr y, they do that, and they use this expression: “Two can play that game.”  And, of course, what does she do?  Well, she flips the teenagers off.  She says, “T ake that!”  The expression “take that” is a phrase we use to emphasize what  you are doing to another person, especially if you’re hurting them or hi tting them or doing something to beat them in a competition.  “Take that!”   Sometimes it’s used playfully, but I don’t think that’s the meaning here.

Nick says, “Are you crazy?!”  Lourdes says, “No, I’m just giving  as good as I get.” “To give as good as you get” means that you do the same a mount that someone does to you back to them.  Usually it’s a negative behavior;  you’re insulting them or you’re doing something bad to them.  “To give as go od as you get.”  It’s similar to the phrase “two can play that game.”

“Look what they’re doing now,” Lourdes says.  Nick says, “They’ re mooning us!” “To moon (moon) (someone)” is an informal expression tha t means to pull your pants down and bend over and show someone your behind.  For some reason, this became popular in the 1970s, briefly.  I’m not sur e why.  I’m not sure what was in the water at that time!  But, to moon someone is a very insulting, physical action – a gesture, if you will, using your body to insult  them by showing them your behind.  I will not moon you in this podcast – well , if I did, you couldn’t see me anyway!

Lourdes says, “Well, two can play that game, too (also)!”   Nick says, “What?!  Are you nuts?!  You can’t moon them back.”  Lourdes says, “Oh, n o?  Watch me!” “To be nuts” means to be crazy.  Nick says, “Are you nuts (are  you crazy)?!  You cannot moon them back,” do the same thing that they did  to her, and Lourdes says, “Watch me!”  We use the expression “watch me” when you are going to do something that the other person doesn’t believe that you ’re going to do.  They can’t believe you’re going to that.  Somebody says, “I’m g oing to go to the beach with my jacket on,” and the other person says, “Well, rea lly?  That’s crazy.  I don’t believe you,” and the crazy person says, “Watch me,” meanin g I’m going to do it even though you don’t believe me.  So, Lourdes is a lit tle – a little crazy here,

 letting the teenagers take control of her anger.  Per haps she just needs to step away from the window and relax!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lourdes:  Do you see those teenagers over there?  They’r e making trouble again.

Nick:  Those kids are just messing around.  When they get bored, they’ll pipe down and go home.

Lourdes:  They’re really getting on my nerves, playing lo ud music and making all that noise.  They’re a disgrace.

Nick:  Get away from that window before they see you.  If  they see that they can’t get a rise out of us, they’ll move along.  What are you doing?  What are you planning to do with that broom?

Lourdes:  I’m going to use it to wave them off.

Nick:  I wouldn’t do that if I were you.  Teenagers can  be unpredictable.  You don’t know if a small slight might set them off.  Insult  them and you’re asking for trouble.

Lourdes:  I don’t care.  I’m doing it anyway.

Nick:  Great!  Now you have their attention.  They’re f lipping us off!

Lourdes:  Yeah, well, two can play that game.  Take tha t!

Nick:  Are you crazy?!

Lourdes:  No, I’m just giving as good as I get.  Look wh at they’re doing now!

Nick:  They’re mooning us!

Lourdes:  Well, two can play that game, too!

Nick:  What?!  Are you nuts?!  You can’t moon them back.

 Lourdes:  Oh, no?  Watch me!

# Exterior Parts of a Car

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 30: Exterior Parts of a Car.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 530.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at eslpod.com.  Check out our Learning  Guides, our 8- to 10- page guides for our current episodes that help you impr ove your English even faster.

This episode is called “Exterior Parts of a Car.”  It’s a dialogue between Ethan and Marie, and it will review a lot of basic vocabular y related to what you find on a car.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ethan:  You missed a spot.

Marie:  Hold on.  When we made our bet for the loser  to wash the winner’s car, it didn’t include the other person being there and being  a pain in the neck.

Ethan:  I’m just here to make sure everything gets washed  properly, from the hood to the taillights.

Marie:  Don’t you worry.  See how carefully I’m washing the windshield, side mirrors, and headlights?  I bet they’ve never been clea ner.

Ethan:  When are you going to get to the tires and the hubcaps?  And I think you forgot the tailpipe.

Marie:  Will you get lost?  I’ll do a better job with out you looking over my shoulder.

Ethan:  I doubt that.  If I weren’t here, who would  remind you to clean the roof rack and the windshield wipers?  I bet you would have fo rgotten those, for sure.

Marie:  I’m going to forget about this whole thing i f you don’t shut up.

 Ethan:  Nah uh.  That’s not an option.  When you lose a bet, you have to pay the price.

Marie:  Well, I’m willing to be a graceful loser if yo u’ll stop gloating.

Ethan:  Not a chance!  Don’t forget the grills!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Ethan saying to Marie, “You missed a spot.”  A “spot” is a small area of something.  In this case, Marie is washing  Ethan’s car, and Ethan is telling her that there is a part of the car that she  didn’t wash properly.  We sometimes use this expression as a joke; when someone is washi ng their car or cleaning something, we may say, “Oh, you missed a spot,” sayi ng that they’re not doing a very good job.  Of course, it’s probably not our  business to be telling them, and certainly that’s the way Marie feels about Eth an!

Marie says, “Hold on (meaning stop).  When we made our bet for the loser to wash the winner’s car, it didn’t include the other pers on being there and being a pain in the neck.”  So Ethan and Marie had made some b et that Marie lost, and so Marie has to wash Ethan’s car.  But, she says, the bet (their agreement over something that if it happened one way would result in Marie winning, if it happened the other way, would result in Ethan winning ) didn’t include the other person being a pain in the neck.  The expression “a pain in the neck” is a person who is very annoying, a person who makes things difficult o r frustrating.  My older brother is a pain in the neck.  I won’t say which older brother; since I have eight, they can guess which one it is!

Ethan says, “I’m just here to make sure everything gets wa shed properly (gets washed correctly), from the hood to the taillights.”  the “hood” is a large, flat piece of metal in the front of the car that, in an Am erican car, covers the engine (the motor).  So the hood is something that is in the  front that lifts up like a door. The “taillights” are two red lights in the back of the  car that indicate when you are going to stop.  The lights turn on when you step on the brake, which slows down or stops your car.

Marie said, “Don’t you worry (meaning don’t worry).  S ee how carefully I’m washing the windshield, side mirrors, and headlights?  I bet they’ve never been cleaner.”  She’s saying that she’s washing the “windshield, ” which is the large window in the front of the car that you look out thr ough; the “side mirrors,” which are the two mirrors, one on each side of the car that allows you to see if someone is behind you or next to you; and the “headligh ts,” which are the two

 lights on the front of the car that help you see at nig ht.  Marie says, “I bet they’ve never been cleaner,” meaning this is the cleanest that th ey have ever been because I am washing them, so Ethan shouldn’t complain.  That’s what she’s saying here.

Ethan says, “When are you going to get to the tires and the hubcaps?”  “When are you going to get to” here means when are you going  to start working on the hubcaps and the tires.  The “tire” is the thick piece of r ubber that goes around the four wheels of your car.  A “hubcap” is a flat, round p iece of metal that covers the side of the tire; it’s used mostly for decoration.  Som e people like to buy very expensive, fancy hubcaps; some people, like me, don’t care.  Then Ethan says, we think jokingly, “And I think you forgot the tailpipe .”  The “tailpipe” is a long, round metal tube that comes out of the back of the car, where the hot gases from the engine go out.  We don’t ever wash the tailpipe.  No one ever sees it for the most part, so most people would never wash the tailpipe.   We think, then, that Ethan here is just trying to make a joke.

Marie then says, “Will you get lost?”  Normally, if you get lost you don’t know where you are.  But if someone tells you to get lost, t hey’re saying they want you to go away, to leave that person alone.  That’s to get  lost.  It’s a very informal, somewhat rude thing to say to someone.  You would only say it to someone you knew very well, or someone that you didn’t know that you d idn’t care you were being rude to.  It’s not a nice thing to say.  Marie says,  “I’ll do a better job without you looking over my shoulder.”  “To look over (someone’s) shoulder” means to observe very closely what the other person is doing, usually w e use this expression when the other person (the person doing the task – doing the action) doesn’t want you watching them.  So if you are, for ex ample, fixing something, and someone comes and watches you to make sure you do it r ight, and you don’t want them there, you may say, “Stop looking over my shoulde r!”  That’s what Marie is asking Ethan to do.

Ethan says, “I doubt that (I doubt you would do a bette r job if I weren’t here, he means).  If I weren’t here, who would remind you to clean the roof rack and the windshield wipers?”  The “roof” (roof) is the top of t he car.  The “roof rack” is something that you put on the top of your car so that yo u can put, for example, suitcases, boxes, skis, things like that on top of your car wit hout damaging your car.  They’re long pieces of metal that protect the roof  (the top of the car), and allow you to put things on top of them.  Most cars still  have roof racks, although because cars have gotten so much larger, I don’t see them being used as much. I guess people put things inside of their car instead.  E than mentions the windshield wipers.  We said the windshield is the window  that you look through in the front of the car.  The “wipers” are the things th at go back and forth that clean

 the water off of the windshield.  There are usually tw o of them in the front of the car, and they have little pieces of rubber on them tha t help you remove the water from your windshield when, for example, it’s raining.  Ethan says, “I bet you would have forgotten those, for sure.”  “For sure,” he re, means definitely, certainly.

Marie says, “I’m going to forget about this whole thing  if you don’t shut up.” She’s saying I am going to stop washing your car unless you be quiet.  Ethan says, “Nah uh.”  This is a very informal way of saying no, so mething you might hear from a child.  “Nah uh” means not at all, absolu tely not.  Ethan says, “That’s not an option (you don’t have that choice).  When you l ose a bet, you have to pay the price.”  Marie says, “Well, I’m willing to be a gra ceful loser if you’ll stop gloating.”  Someone who is “graceful” is someone who is polite, pleasant, perhaps sophisticated.  In this case, Marie means that she’ ll be a nice loser; she won’t complain if Ethan stops gloating.  “To gloat” (g loat) means to brag, to talk about your good luck or your success, especially around other people who are not successful.  So if you take an exam in school and you ge t a very high score, and no one else got a high score, to gloat would mean to say, “Oh, what a great score I got!  You got a low score?  Oh, that’s too bad.”   That would be to gloat. It’s not a very good thing – nice thing to do.

Ethan, however, says, “Not a chance!” meaning there’s no w ay that he’s going to stop gloating.  Finally he says, “Don’t forget the grill s!”  The “grill” is a vertical or horizontal piece of metal in the front of the car that  protects the engine and the radiator.  So, in the very front of the car – in some  cars anyway, there’s a grill; it’s sort of like a screen that allows air to go into where t he engine is.  Not all cars have grills.  Ethan is reminding Marie that she should w ash the grill as well.  The word “grill,” and the word “hood” that we used in th is dialogue, have additional meanings.  Please take a look at our Learning Guide for  some additional explanations.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ethan:  You missed a spot.

Marie:  Hold on.  When we made our bet for the loser  to wash the winner’s car, it didn’t include the other person being there and being  a pain in the neck.

Ethan:  I’m just here to make sure everything gets washed  properly, from the hood to the taillights.

# Describing Fabric Patterns

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 31: Describing Fabric Patterns.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 531.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there and download a Lea rning Guide for this episode.  You can support ESL Podcast by becoming a Learn ing Guide member or by making a small donation on our website.

This episode is called “Describing Fabric Patterns.”  “Fabr ic” is what you use to make clothing or to put on a couch.  “Pattern,” here, r efers to the design, so we’re going to be talking about common designs that you would  see on fabric for something such as a chair or a couch.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ruth:  Now that we’ve picked out a new couch, we need to  pick out an upholstery fabric.  What do you think of this checkered one?

Gerry:  That’s an eyesore.  I prefer something a little more subtle.

Ruth:  Subtle?  What’s fun about subtle?  I want some thing bold and that’ll make a statement.  How about this one with the polka dots?

Gerry:  You’ve got to be kidding!  That pattern is so bu sy, if I had to look at that every day, I’d go crazy.

Ruth:  All right, what do you think of this one with t he stripes?

Gerry:  I’m not crazy about it, but it’s not as tacky as the  others ones.

Ruth:  Okay then, you pick one out.

Gerry:  Fine.  Let me see…Now this is a sight for sore eyes!

Ruth:  But that has no pattern at all!  It’s a solid b lue color, and a boring shade of blue to boot.

 Gerry:  That’s right.  That’s what I call a classic.

Ruth:  And that’s what I call dull!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue between Ruth and Gerry begins with Ruth saying, “Now that we’ve picked out a new couch, we need to pick out an upholstery fabric.”  “To pick out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to select, to choose.  “I need to go pick out a new shirt at the store,” I need to find a shirt, select  one to buy.  Ruth and Gerry have picked out a new couch (a new sofa).  Now, they need  to pick out an upholstery fabric.  “Fabric” is soft material, usually ma de from cotton, wool, silk, other things, that is used to cover something; it can be u sed to make clothing as well.  In this case, they’re buying fabric for upholstery.  “Upholstery” (upholstery) is specifically the material that is used to cover furnitur e, such as chairs and sofas, couches – that sort of thing.

Ruth says, “What do you think of this checkered one?”  She’ s showing him a sample of this upholstery fabric.  Something that is “check ered” is basically a grid-like pattern, where you have vertical and horizont al lines crossing each other at regular intervals (at regular distances), so that you end up with these little squares.  We talk about the game of checkers; that’s a che ckered pattern on the actual board itself, where you have horizontal and verti cal lines crossing.  There could also be different colors inside of the squares, as is the case on a checkerboard.

Well, Gerry doesn’t like the pattern; he says, “That’s an eyesore (eyesore – one word).”  An “eyesore” means something is very ugly, somethi ng that is painful to look at, something that is very unpleasant.  It’s a very insu lting, negative way of describing something.  Gerry says, “I prefer something a l ittle more subtle.”  “To be subtle” (subtle) means that it’s not as easily noticed; “subtle” can also mean not drawing to attention to yourself, meaning you’re not trying to get other people to look at you.  “Subtle” can be used in many different ways.  Here it’s used as a description of a pattern, a pattern that is visually subtl e, meaning you can see the differences in the pattern but they aren’t as bold – t hey aren’t as strong as, for example, in a checkered pattern, where the pattern is ver y obvious.

Ruth says, “Subtle?  What’s fun about subtle?  I want som ething bold that makes a statement.”  “Bold,” as I mentioned, is strong, brigh t, something that attracts your attention, something you notice easily.  She wants a fabric pattern that makes a statement.  The expression “to make a statement” me ans that you are doing something that is different, that is interesting,  that is unique, but you are

 doing it in such a way that you want other people to n otice.  Maybe you’re trying to communicate some idea, but rather than saying it you d o something to make a statement.  That’s what she’s trying to do with her fabr ic.  I’m not sure to whom she’s making the statement, but she wants to make a stateme nt, Ruth does! Ruth says, “How about this one with the polka dots (polka  dots – two words)?”  A “polka dot” is a design with many small circles.  It’s usual ly, in most cases, considered a very bold, a very dramatic kind of pattern.  Most people kind of make fun of polka dot patterns nowadays; it seems very ol d-fashion to us.  You might wear a polka dot pattern as a joke, for example,  but you don’t see it very often.

Gerry says, “You’ve got to be kidding (meaning you must be joking – you’re joking)!  That pattern is so busy, if I had to look at th at every day, I’d go crazy.” The “pattern,” we’ve already explained, is the design, u sually a repeating design on something.  “Busy,” when we’re talking about a visual pattern (the ways something looks), means that there are a lot of small th ings to look at, so that your eyes don’t quite know what to focus on.  Something that would be “busy” would be something that would have too many small detai ls.  “Busy,” however, has a couple of different meanings in English; you can fi nd those in our Learning Guide.

Gerry thinks that the polka dot pattern is too busy.  He sa ys if he had to look at it every day, he’d go crazy (he’d go mad).  Ruth says, “All rig ht, what do you think of this one with the stripes?”  A “stripe” is a thick line ; it’s a design that has many horizontal lines or vertical lines, but not both.  If it  had both, that would be a checkered pattern.  You often will see businesspeople dre ssed in very nice suits, and sometimes they are what are called “pinstripe.”  The re’s a thin line pattern on the fabric.

Gerry says, “I’m not crazy about that pattern.”  “To be cr azy about (something),” in this case, means to be very excited and interested in some thing, something that you like a lot.  He says he’s not crazy about it, “but  it’s not as tacky as the others ones.”  The adjective “tacky” (tacky) means unattractive,  inappropriate, showing very poor taste, showing that you’re not very good at knowing what is attractive and appropriate for a place.  So, he’s saying this one is not as tacky as the other ones, meaning the other ones are very tacky.  “ Tacky” is a very negative way of describing something.

Ruth says, “Okay then, you pick one out (you select one).”  G erry says, “Fine. Let me see…Now this is a sight for sore eyes!”  He picks up on e of the patterns and says it’s a sight for sore (sore) eyes.  “A sight for so re eyes” is something that is very pretty, very attractive, especially after you’ve be en looking at ugly

 things for a long time.  “Sore” would be hurt, used t oo often.  If you have sore eyes, you’ve been looking at too many things; in this case, too many ugly things. However, this expression is often used sarcastically.  If some one comes in and they’re all dirty, they may be described as “a sight for so re eyes” meaning that as a joke.  Meaning they’re, in fact, not a good sight for  sore eyes because they’re also ugly.  But here, he means it in the original sense of something that is pretty and attractive.

Ruth says, “But that has no pattern at all!  It’s a soli d blue color, with a boring shade of blue to boot.”  Something that is “solid,” wh en it comes to design, is only one color; it has no design or pattern.  You would say, “It’s a solid green,” that implies (that means) there is no pattern to it; it’s ju st the color green.  Ruth says that not only is it a solid blue color, it also has a bor ing shade of blue to boot.  A “shade” of a color is a type of a color.  You can have re d, or dark red, or light red; those are different shades, or “hues” (hue) is another w ord we use.  “To boot,” in this case, means in addition to.  It’s a phrase we use to emphasize the last thing that you said.  I once had a girlfriend who said, “Jeff , you’re ugly, you’re poor, and you’re stupid to boot!”  Oh, no, wait a minute.  That wasn’t me, that was Brad Pitt I think they said that about!  “Boot” has several me anings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Ruth doesn’t like this solid blue color.  Gerry says it may be a boring shade of blue but it’s a “classic,” meaning it’s something that ever yone recognizes as high quality.  Ruth says, “And that’s what I call dull!”  Som ething that is “dull” (dull) is uninteresting, not very exciting – sort of like my life, kin d of dull!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ruth:  Now that we’ve picked out a new couch, we need to  pick out an upholstery fabric.  What do you think of this checkered one?

Gerry:  That’s an eyesore.  I prefer something a little more subtle.

Ruth:  Subtle?  What’s fun about subtle?  I want some thing bold and that’ll make a statement.  How about this one with the polka dots?

Gerry:  You’ve got to be kidding!  That pattern is so bu sy, if I had to look at that every day, I’d go crazy.

Ruth:  All right, what do you think of this one with t he stripes?

 Gerry:  I’m not crazy about it, but it’s not as tacky as the  others ones.

Ruth:  Okay then, you pick one out.

Gerry:  Fine.  Let me see…Now this is a sight for sore eyes!

Ruth:  But that has no pattern at all!  It’s a solid b lue color, and a boring shade of blue to boot.

Gerry:  That’s right.  That’s what I call a classic.

Ruth:  And that’s what I call dull!

# Using an Online Email Program

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 32: Using an Online Email Program.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 532.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Using an Online Email Program” ( or email service).  It’s a dialogue between Luigi and Selma using a lot of commo n vocabulary that we “employ” (that we use) when we talk about using email o nline.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Luigi:  What do you think of this new email program?

Selma:  I don’t know yet.  I just started using it.  The  interface is pretty intuitive, but I haven’t figured out how to sort my inbox by date.

Luigi:  That’s easy.  Let me show you.  All you have to do  is hit one of these buttons and it’ll sort automatically.

Selma:  Oh, I see.  Let me try to compose a message.  I ’ll cc: myself and I’ll bcc: you to make sure it goes through.  It looks like if I don ’t want to send it right away, I can save the message as a draft.  If I do send it, does it save a copy?

Luigi:  Yes, it should.  Refresh the page and it should  show up in “sent mail.”

Selma:  Oh, yeah, there it is.  Let’s see, I can also arch ive messages or mark them as junk or send them straight to trash.  How do I add contacts?

Luigi:  You can put contacts into your address book by dra gging an email address into your “contacts” folder, like this.

 Selma:  Okay, one more thing: I want to set up spam fil ters and some other filters to block unwanted emails.

Luigi:  You can do that in this window, see?  Whose ema ils are you blocking?

Selma:  Yours, if don’t stop forwarding all of those st upid jokes every day.

Luigi:  And deprive you of the fun?  Never!

[end of dialogue]

Luigi begins by saying, “What do you think of this new e mail program?”  A “program” is a piece of software that is used on a comput er for certain purposes, in this case for checking your email.  Selma says, “I don’t know yet.  I just started using it.  The interface is pretty intuitive.”  The “int erface” is what you see on the screen for that program.  It’s the way that you interact  with the program; the way information is displayed to you on the screen for the pro gram.  She says, “The interface is pretty intuitive.”  Something that is “intu itive” is easy to understand; it doesn’t require an explanation.  Selma says, “I haven’t f igured out how to sort my inbox by date.”  “To sort” means to put something in o rder, usually so that it’s easier to find something later.  You could sort things a lphabetically, beginning with A, B, C, and so forth.  You could sort things by da te, with the most recent email messages first.  Those are both ways of sorting your “ inbox,” that is what we call a “folder” in your email program where you see all of your new messages. You have different folders on a typical email program.   Just like you have a physical folder where you put paper, an email folder i s where you have certain kinds of email.  The inbox is where all the new messages a rrive on your computer program.

Luigi says that it’s easy to sort her inbox by date.  He says,  “Let me show you. All you have to do (meaning the only thing you have to d o) is hit one of these buttons and it’ll sort automatically.”  Selma says, “Oh, I  see.  Let me try to compose a message.”  “To compose” means to write somethin g, such as a letter, an email, an essay.  We sometimes also use this verb when ta lking about those that write music; we call them “composers,” they compose symp honies and songs for example.

Selma says, “I’ll cc: myself and I’ll bcc: you to make sure the y go through.”  “To cc: (someone)” means to send a copy of a message to other pe ople in addition to the primary person you are sending your message to.  So I  may be sending a message to my brother, but I’ll cc: my sister; she’ll also g et a copy of the email. We use the letters “cc” because they come from an old term , which is “carbon

 copy.”  Before the days of copiers (of photo-static copiers ) the only way to make a copy of a document was to put two pieces of paper into a typewriter, and you would put a piece of black or blue carbon paper in betw een the two pieces of paper.  And when you typed on the first page, the carbo n would also mark the second page and you would have a copy of that particular document.  However, you had to do it when you were typing.  If you typed it without putting the extra piece paper and the piece of carbon paper it wouldn’t  work.  I remember using carbon paper back in the 1970s, when I was in high school.   “Bcc:” is a adaptation of the old term into a new context.  “To bcc: (someone)” means to blind carbon copy someone.  This is a concept that only exists in modern email technology.  A “bcc:” is when you’re going to send anothe r copy of your message, but you’re not indicating to the primary person  that you are sending a copy to this other person.  So for example, I send a messa ge to my brother, I cc: my sister, and then I bcc: my mother.  That means that my m other gets a copy, but my brother and my sister don’t realize it.  That’s wh y we say it’s “blind.”  “To be blind” means to be unable to see, so “bcc:” is when yo u are sending a copy of something that other people who receive the message are n’t aware of.  They don’t know another copy is going to someone else.

Selma says she wants to make sure the message “went through ,” meaning that it was received, that it was actually sent out.  “It looks like if I don’t want to send it right away,” she says, “I can save the message as a draft.”  A “draft” is something that you write, but it needs be edited; it needs to b e finished.  It’s not the final version.  “Draft” has a couple of different meanings in  English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Selma says, “If I do send it, does it save a copy?” meaning does the program (the email program) save a copy of the message.  Luigi says , “Yes, it should. Refresh the page and it will show up in ‘sent mail.’”  “To refresh” a web page means that you make sure the page or the program is displ aying the most recent information.  On your web browser, the piece of softw are you use to look at things on the Internet, there is usually a refresh butt on.  You hit that button and the page we say “loads” again; it comes onto your screen a gain with the most recent version of that page.  Luigi says, “Refresh the pag e and the message will show up in ‘sent mail.’”  “Sent mail” is the folder in  your email program where you find copies of all the messages that you’ve sent.  There’s a  third folder on most email programs called an “outbox.”  An “outbox” contain s the messages that you are ready to send, but haven’t actually sent yet.  So your  outbox contains messages ready to send; your sent mail folder contains messag es you’ve already sent in the past.

 Selma says, “Oh, yeah, there it is.”  She refreshes the pa ge and she sees her message.  “Let’s see, I can also archive messages or mark the m as junk or send them straight to trash.”  “To archive” your messages mean s to take your messages out of your inbox, but not delete it; save it in another folder for later. Most people have different folders with different kinds of messages, so that you can find your messages easily later on, but you take them out of your inbox.  If a message is “spam,” if it is an advertisement that you didn’ t request or some email from someone you don’t know that you don’t want, we some times call that “junk mail” (“junk” is garbage).  Email messages that you don’t  want and you no longer want to see in your inbox, you can mark them as junk and th en put them in your trash to get rid of them (to delete them).

Selma says, “How do I add contacts?”  “Contact” is a person  with whom you are communicating.  Usually you have the person’s name, their e mail address, perhaps their phone number, their “physical” address, mea ning where their house or their office is.  This is information you would find in your contacts.  So, she wants to add a new contact.  Luigi says, “You can put contacts into your address book by dragging an email message into your ‘cont acts’ folder, like this.” So on Selma’s email program, you can take an email add ress and “drag it,” that is click on something, continue to hold down the button o n your mouse, and you move it to another part of the screen, and then you let  your mouse go.  That’s to drag things on your computer.

Selma says, “Okay, one more thing: I want to set up spam filters and some other filters to block unwanted email.”  A “spam filter” is a part of a program that blocks the junk (unwanted messages) that you get on email.  “To  block” means not to allow something to happen; in this case, not to allow e mail messages to come into your inbox.  Luigi says, “You can do that in this win dow, see?  Whose emails are you blocking?”  Selma says, “Yours (meaning Luigi’s), i f don’t stop forwarding all of those stupid jokes every day.”  This means that she’s g oing to start blocking Luigi’s email address so that emails that he sends her wil l not appear in her inbox.  Why?  Well, Luigi likes to “forward,” likes to se nd an email that he received from one person to another person.  It’s very comm on for people to send an email message that contains something they think is funny to someone else.  Often, however, the other person doesn’t want this email, and doesn’t think the joke is very funny.  I am one of those people; please do not forward me any jokes!

Luigi says, “And deprive you of the fun?  Never!” meaning  that if Selma blocks his emails, she’ll be deprived of the fun (the fun from  reading the messages).  “To deprive” (deprive) means not to let someone have somethin g or do something that is considered nice, fun, or pleasant.  “I’m going to deprive you of your coffee

 today,” you want it, but I’m not going to let you have it.  Since I don’t drink coffee anymore, that wouldn’t bother me at all; I only drink tea!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Luigi:  What do you think of this new email program?

Selma:  I don’t know yet.  I just started using it.  The  interface is pretty intuitive, but I haven’t figured out how to sort my inbox by date.

Luigi:  That’s easy.  Let me show you.  All you have to do  is hit one of these buttons and it’ll sort automatically.

Selma:  Oh, I see.  Let me try to compose a message.  I ’ll cc: myself and I’ll bcc: you to make sure it goes through.  It looks like if I don ’t want to send it right away, I can save the message as a draft.  If I do send it, does it save a copy?

Luigi:  Yes, it should.  Refresh the page and it should  show up in “sent mail.”

Selma:  Oh, yeah, there it is.  Let’s see, I can also arch ive messages or mark them as junk or send them straight to trash.  How do I add contacts?

Luigi:  And deprive you of the fun?  Never!

# Making Funeral and Burial Arrangements

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 33: Making Funeral and Burial Arrangements.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 533.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development, right here in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Making Funeral and Burial Arrang ements.”  Reiko and Lucas are having a conversation about what will happen wh en they die – what they want done with their body after they die.  So, we ’ll have vocabulary related to death.  On that happy note, let’s get started!

[start of dialogue]

Reiko:  When I die, I want a big funeral.  The more mourners the better!

Lucas:  Not me.  I’m just the opposite.  I don’t want a ny kind of funeral or wake.  I just want to be cremated and have my ashes scattered.

Reiko:  What?  You don’t want to be buried in a beau tiful casket with a big headstone?  Better yet, how about being interred in a  mausoleum?

Lucas:  You’ve got to be kidding me!  Why would I all wa nt all of that hoopla?  I’m dead.  What difference would it make to me?

Reiko:  It’s not for you.  It’s for the mourners.  Having  a ceremony and a burial will help them grieve.

Lucas:  Not my friends and family.  The less fuss the better  for them.  Most of my family is buried in simple gravesites in non-denomination al cemeteries.

Reiko:  What’s the fun in that?

Lucas:  I think you’re forgetting one thing: we’re talki ng about death.  It’s not supposed to be fun and games!

 [end of dialogue]

Reiko begins our dialogue by saying, “When I die, I wan t a big funeral.”  A “funeral” is a ceremony that you have after a person die s; it is a way of allowing people to say goodbye.  Funerals have been around for a s long as we have any sort of recorded history in almost every culture.  Sometime s the funeral is religious; sometimes it is not.  Reiko says she wants a big funeral.  She says, “The more mourners the better!”  A “mourner” (mourne r) is a person who is very sad because someone they know has died, usually a friend or  a member of the family, or it could just be someone they know very well.  “To mourn,” as a verb, means to feel sad because someone has died; you’re rememb ering that person. Often, mourners wear (at least in Western traditions) b lack if they are “in mourning,” that is, if they are observing the time of sa dness, of grief, of sorrow after someone has died.

Reiko says, “The more mourners the better!” meaning she wants as many people there mourning her as possible.  Lucas says, “Not me (I do n’t agree).  I’m just the opposite.  I don’t want any kind of funeral or wake.”  A “wake” (wake) is a period of time after death but before a funeral, when peop le get together to remember the person.  Often there’s food at a wake; it depends on whether it’s held in someone’s home, which was the old tradition, or in what  we would call a “funeral home.”  A “funeral home” is a place that prepares the body after it dies but before it goes into the ground (before it is buried).  Wakes ca n sometimes have a religious aspect to them as well.  When someone dies, the  night before the funeral there’s often a wake, where people can go and talk to each other, talk to the family members, say some prayers for the person who has died.  That’s one kind of wake.  “Wake” has a number of different meaning s; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Lucas says, “I don’t want any kind of funeral or wake.  I j ust want to be cremated and to have my ashes scattered.”  There’s usually two thin gs that you do with the body once someone dies.  One option is to “bury” the bod y; that is, to dig a hole in the ground, and put the body in the hole.  Usually,  you put it in a box before you put it in the hole.  The other option is to “crem ate” (cremate).  When someone is “cremated,” the body is burned until the only thing left you have are what are called “ashes,” gray-colored powder that is l eft.  Those ashes are then sometimes put into a small container, which is called it an “urn” (urn).  Well, Lucas doesn’t want to be buried, he wants to be cremated  and to have his ashes scattered.  “To scatter” (scatter) means to spread something  around, put a small amount of something over a large area.  “To scatter o ne’s ashes” means to take the ashes after the body has been burned – you take what  is left of the body, the ashes, and you throw it, perhaps, over a lake or in the ocean or out in the trees.

 It depends on what your preference is.  Some religious t raditions don’t allow this scattering of ashes; it’s not part of the funeral.  But some people have done this, and continue to do this: take their burned remains and  scatter them somewhere. “Scatter” has a couple of different meanings; take a loo k at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Reiko says, “What?  You don’t want to be buried in a be autiful casket with a big headstone?”  We talked about the verb “to bury,” to put  the body into the ground. This is the traditional way that funerals were conducted .  This is what you typically did, at least in the United States up until r ecently you would have a funeral.  I’m not sure if it is still the most common wa y of getting rid of the body. Perhaps cremation has become more popular, I’m not sure .  The “casket” (casket) is the box that you put the dead body in before it goes into the ground. A “headstone,” sometimes called a “tombstone” (“tomb” i s another word for the place where you put a body), is a piece of stone, typicall y, that has your name on it, often the day that you were born and the day that you died, or the year that you were born and the year that you died.  Sometimes the headstone (or gravestone) has something about the person: “He was a w onderful husband and father.”  On my headstone, it will say: “He is no longe r in beautiful Los Angeles, California”!  That’s a headstone.

Reiko says, “how about being interred in a mausoleum?”  We mentioned how the body in a casket is typically put into the ground.  But th ere’s also another option with a body and a casket, and that is to put the casket in to a mausoleum.  A “mausoleum” is small building that is used to hold the bodies of dead people. Often, this was done with a very rich family for example.   There are some churches that have mausoleums.  The Catholic cathedral he re in Los Angeles has a mausoleum underneath the church, where you can buy a place to have your body put.  “To inter” (inter) means to bury the body or to place it in a mausoleum.  It’s a special verb that we use when we’re t alking about funerals. Sometimes, the actual placing of the body in the ground  or in the mausoleum is called the “internment.”

Lucas says, “You’ve got to be kidding me!  Why would I all want all of that hoopla?”  “Hoopla” (hoopla) means a lot of excitement , a lot of attention, a great deal of activity, many things going on.  It’s a somewhat informal expression to talk about, perhaps, too much excitement, too many things going on.  When someone is celebrating, they may have a party with a lot of hoopla – a lot of things going on, music and dancing, that sort of thing.  Here, Lucas simply means he doesn’t want to go to all of this trouble aft er he dies – or at least, someone else go to that trouble.  He says, “I’m dead.  W hat difference would it make to me?”

 Reiko says, “It’s not for you.  It’s for the mourners.  Havi ng a ceremony and a burial will help them grieve.”  “To grieve” (grieve) means you are feeling sad because someone has died, or you perhaps have lost somethin g important. Reiko is saying that the funeral is to help your friends and family grieve, to get through this sadness, to let the sadness be expressed.

Lucas says, “Not my friends and family.  The less fuss the bett er for them.”  Once again, we have this expression as we had earlier in the dialogue when we heard “The more mourners the better,” here we have “The le ss fuss the better.”  This way of expressing things means simply that it would be bett er if we had more mourners, or it would be better if we had less fuss.  “F uss” (fuss) means a lot of unnecessary activity or excitement.  Lucas says his family and frie nds don’t want all of that.  “Most of my family is buried in simple gra vesites in non- denominational cemeteries.”  A “gravesite” is a place wh ere the body is buried. We mentioned before the word “tomb,” a “gravesite” is similar to that.  A “cemetery” is a large place where there are many differe nt bodies buried. “Denominational” refers to a particular type of church o r religious organization.  In the Christian tradition, that would include Anglicans, Methodists, Baptists, Catholics, and so forth.  Those are all different deno minations.  A “non- denominational” cemetery would be a cemetery for anyone , regardless of their religion.

Reiko says, “What’s the fun in that?” meaning that’s not very interesting.  Lucas says, “I think you’re forgetting about one thing: we’re  talking about death.  It’s not supposed to be fun and games!”  The expression “fun and  games” means things that are not very serious, that are only meant to have a good time.  Reiko says that being cremated and having one’s ashes scattered is n ot very fun, and Lucas says well, it’s not supposed to be fun, because we’re tal king about something that is sad, which is death.  At least, that’s Lucas’ view .

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Reiko:  When I die, I want a big funeral.  The more mourners the better!

Lucas:  Not me.  I’m just the opposite.  I don’t want a ny kind of funeral or wake.  I just want to be cremated and have my ashes scattered.

Reiko:  What?  You don’t want to be buried in a beau tiful casket with a big headstone?  Better yet, how about being interred in a  mausoleum?

# Types of Guns and Weapons

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 34: Types of Guns and Weapons.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 534.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Types of Guns and Weapons,” somewh at of an unusual topic for us.  It’s going to be a dialogue between Bo bbie, who is a woman in this dialogue, and Emmanuel.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Bobbie:  I’ve always pegged you as the non-violent type.  What’s with your fascination with guns and that sort of thing?

Emmanuel:  I come from a long line of military office rs and I grew up with all of it. Believe it or not, I learned how to fire pistols and r ifles before I was 10 years old, and by the time I was 14, I was a pretty good shot.

Bobbie:  I hope you fired at targets and not at peopl e.

Emmanuel:  No, not people.  We did do some hunting when I was young, but I mainly honed my skills with target practice.

Bobbie:  I’d like to try target practice – with a machin e gun or a grenade launcher! I’m sure I’d at least hit something.

Emmanuel:  Yeah, right.  What really interests me are  the big weapons, like missiles – you know, like antiballistic missiles and torpedoes.

Bobbie:  You can have all of the missiles you want.  I’l l be hiding in the tank!

[end of dialogue]

 Bobbie begins by saying to Emmanuel, “I’ve always pegged you as a non-violent type.”  “To peg (peg) (someone) as (something)” means to  believe that that person has certain characteristics or will behave in a certai n way.  For example, you might say, “I’ve always pegged you as a good swimmer,” meaning I’ve always thought that you were or believed that you were a  good swimmer.  You could also say, “I always pegged him as a great decision-make r,” someone who could make good decisions.  Bobbie says that she’s always pegge d Emmanuel as the non-violent type.  “Non-violent” means you don’t b elieve that people should hurt each other, usually that means you’re not int erested in things like guns and weapons.  A “weapon” is merely anything you use to hurt someone or to protect yourself, so a knife could be a weapon for example.  A gun is a weapon.

Bobbie then says, “What’s with your fascination with guns and that sort of thing?” “What’s with” is a construction we use to mean tell me mo re about, or why do you do that, I don’t understand why you are acting this wa y.  Someone may be feeling sad and they may be crying, and you may say, “What’s with the crying? What’s wrong?”  There’s something of a challenge ther e, too, when we use this expression sometimes: “What’s with your bad attitude?”  I t’s almost like you’re puzzled – you’re surprised, and perhaps you’re a little cri tical, though not always.

So, Bobbie says, “What’s with your fascination (your extreme  interest) with guns and that sort of thing?”  “That sort of thing” mean s related things.  Emmanuel says, “I come from a long line of military officers.”  He’ s trying to explain why he’s interested in guns.  He says, “I come from a long line of  military officers.”  The expression “to come from a long line of (something)” mea ns that you had relatives (your father, your grandfather, your great-gra ndfather, your great-great- grandfather) or other people who came before you in your family who were interested in some particular area or who had a certai n job.  For example, I come from a long line of plumbers.  My grandfather was a pl umber, my great- grandfather was a plumber, my great-great-grandfather  was a plumber, my uncles were all plumbers.  My father was the only one – the only male in his family that wasn’t a plumber, but I could say I come fr om a long line of plumbers. I could say that – I don’t actually say that, especially to m y wife, because then she wants me to fix the sink!

Emmanuel, however, comes from a long line of “militar y officers,” people in the army, the navy – soldiers.  An “officer” is someone who is in charge soldiers; so a lieutenant, a sergeant, a captain, a general, these wo uld all be military officers. Emmanuel says, “I grew up with all of it,” meaning it was something I saw as a young child.  He says, “Believe it or not,” an expression we  use when we’re about to say something that the person might not believe, somet hing surprising,

 “Believe they’re not,” he says, “I learned how to fire p istols and rifles before I was 10 years old.”  “To fire a gun” means to make the gun shoot, to pull what we call the “trigger,” moving your finger so that the bullet w ill leave the gun.  That’s to fire a gun.  This particular gun is a pistol.  A “pistol” is a  small gun that you can hold in your hand.  Someone who is robbing a bank (who is tr ying to steal money from a bank) might have a pistol.  A “rifle” is a large, lon g gun, usually used for hunting.  It can also be used in a war, however.

So, Emmanuel learned how to fire – how to use pistol s and rifles even before he was 10 years old, “and by the time I was 14, I was a pre tty good shot.”  “To be a good shot” means that you can use a gun or a rifle very we ll.  You can, for example, hit a bird flying up in the air with just one  bullet – one shot.  That would be a good shot.  In the police and in the military for ces they train soldiers to use guns.  If you are very good at what you do, if you’re an  excellent what we would call “marksman” or “markswoman,” then they would call you a “sniper” (sniper) or a “sharpshooter.”  These are both terms used to describe someone who is an excellent shot, not just a good shot, a very good shot.

Bobbie says, “I hope you fired at targets and not at peo ple.”  When we talk about shooting guns, a “target” is an object or a thing that you try to hit with the bullet of your gun.  You can go, for example, to special places whe re they have targets that are small circles; we would call them “concentric” circl es, one circle inside of a larger circle, inside of a larger circle, and you try to  hit the middle of this circle. That would be a target.  She is saying here that she ho pes that Emmanuel was firing at (was shooting at) targets and not at people.

Emmanuel says, “No, not people.  We did do some hunting  when I was young.” Notice here, he could of just said “we hunted when I w as young,” but to express the past tense he instead uses “we did do some hunting.”   This is to emphasize, usually in a case where you are making a distinction so tha t the other person understands well, no, I didn’t do this, but I did do t his.  “Hunting” is when you go out and try to kill animals.  Hunting is legal in many st ates; it’s only legal, usually, for a certain number of weeks and during a certain tim e of year.  The fall is a very common time when there is hunting season.  This is especial ly popular in states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin, where it is legal during ce rtain times of the year to go and hunt deer and hunt certain kinds of bird s.  I know people who have done this; they own guns and they get a license to go  and hunt.  You need to get a license – you need to get permission from the g overnment.

Emmanuel says, “We did do some hunting when I was young, but I mainly (meaning I mostly) honed my skills with target practice.”  “To hone (hone) your skills” means to improve your ability to do something, to g et better at something.

 You might say, “I’m going to hone my typing skills.”  I’m  going to sit at my keyboard and improve my typing.  That would be to hone your skills, to make them better.  Emmanuel says that he honed his skills with a gun by doing target practice.  “Target practice” is shooting at targets we tal ked about before.  There are places where you can go that are called “shooting ranges,” and you can go and practice shooting at these targets.  There are clubs – gun clubs that you can join that have these special buildings that have target  practice shooting ranges.

Bobbie says, “I’d like to try target practice – with a ma chine gun or a grenade launcher!”  A “machine gun” is a large gun that fires m any bullets automatically and very quickly.  It’s the sort of thing that you would use  in a war; it’s not the sort of thing you would normally use, for example, with the  police.  Although, if you remember the 1920s and 30s in the United States, and e ver saw any of the movies about the “gangsters,” people who were profession al criminals, sometimes in the movies you see them with machine guns.  O f course, sometimes you saw them in real life with machine guns!  That is a criminal use of machine guns.  But, the idea here is that Bobbie woul d have to use a machine gun because, she says, “I’m sure I’d at least hit somethin g,” meaning she’s not a very good shot, so she would need something like a machine  gun in order to hit something – in order to have the bullet go through som ething.  A “grenade” is a small, hand-held bomb that is usually used by soldiers in a war.  A “grenade launcher” is a machine that throws these bombs a long dist ance.

Emmanuel says, “Yeah, right.  What really interests me are the big weapons, like missiles – you know, like antiballistic missiles and torpedoes. ”  We’ve already talked about what weapons are, anything you use to hurt someone else or something else.  A “missile” is a bomb that is sent throug h the air at a long distance.  Sometimes it is dropped by a plane, sometimes i t is “launched,” it is shot from the ground.  An “antiballistic missile” is a bo mb that is made to hit other bombs that are in the air, so it’s sort of a missile to stop another missile.  A “torpedo” is a missile that shot by a “submarine,” a ship  that is underneath the water.

Bobbie says, “You can have all the missiles you want.  I’l l be hiding in the tank!” A “tank” (tank) is a very large, heavy vehicle.  It’s like a b ig truck that is used by the army, and it has a large gun on the top of it for fighting.  “Tank,” like the word “fire” we used earlier, has a couple of different mea nings in English, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explan ations.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Bobbie:  I’ve always pegged you as the non-violent type.  What’s with your fascination with guns and that sort of thing?

Emmanuel:  I come from a long line of military office rs and I grew up with all of it. Believe it or not, I learned how to fire pistols and r ifles before I was 10 years old, and by the time I was 14, I was a pretty good shot.

Bobbie:  I hope you fired at targets and not at peopl e.

Emmanuel:  No, not people.  We did do some hunting when I was young, but I mainly honed my skills with target practice.

Bobbie:  I’d like to try target practice – with a machin e gun or a grenade launcher! I’m sure I’d at least hit something.

Emmanuel:  Yeah, right.  What really interests me are  the big weapons, like missiles – you know, like antiballistic missiles and torpedoes.

Bobbie:  You can have all of the missiles you want.  I’l l be hiding in the tank!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 35: Describing Speed and Pace.

This episode is called “Describing Speed and Pace.”  It’s a  dialogue between Chiu and Sarah that uses a lot of vocabulary we use to de scribe how fast or how slow things go.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Chiu:  Come on, slowpoke, hurry up!  We’ll never get to  the top of the hill if you don’t get a move on.

Sarah:  There’s no way you’re going to get me to move a t breakneck speed.  I’ve gone up at least 500 steps already, and my legs are about  to fall off.  Tell me again why we’re trudging up this hill?

Chiu:  It’s the only way to the ruins and the view from there will really be worth your while.  Trust me.  Pick up the pace or we won’t get  there before sunset!

Sarah:  It’s not like I’m dawdling here.  I may be movi ng at a snail’s pace, but this is as fast as I can manage without keeling over.  If you’r e in such a hurry, you can sprint up there by yourself.  Go ahead.  Impress me w ith your blinding speed.

Chiu:  I’m not about to leave you here all by yourself.

Sarah:  Why?  Do you feel sorry for me?

Chiu:  Yes, I always feel sorry for the physically challenged .

  Sarah:  Oh, yeah?  Better physically challenged than men tally challenged!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Chiu saying to Sarah, “Come o n, slowpoke, hurry up!” A “slowpoke” (slowpoke – one word) is an informal, somewh at insulting term to describe someone who moves very slowly, who doesn’t move very qu ickly.  It’s a sort of thing that you might hear children say to each ot her: “You’re such a slowpoke!  Why can’t you run faster?”  Oh, wait a minute;  that’s what they used to say to me!  Anyway, “slowpoke” is someone who moves very slo wly.  So, Chiu is telling her to “hurry up,” to go faster, to increase your speed.  He says, “We’ll never get to the top of the hill if you don’t get a m ove on.”  “To get a move on” is another informal expression meaning to hurry, to begin moving more quickly.  It’s something a parent might say to their child: “Hey!  Let’ s get a move on, we have to leave here by eight o’clock.”

Sarah says, “There’s no way you’re going to get me to mo ve at breakneck speed.”  Something that is “breakneck” (breakneck – one wo rd) is something that is very quick, something that is so quick – so fast that it’s dangerous.  It’s so dangerous you could, if you fell, break your neck; I think that’s the general idea. Sarah says, “I’ve gone up at least 500 steps already, and m y legs are about to fall off.”  The expression “my legs are about to fall o ff” means she’s very, very tired.  She says, “Tell me again why we’re trudging up  this hill?”  “To trudge” (trudge) means to walk very slowly because, perhaps, it’s very difficult to walk up, or because you really don’t want to be doing what you’r e doing, walking in the direction you’re walking.

Chiu says, “It’s the only way to the ruins and the view fro m there will really be worth your while.”  So, Sarah and Chiu are obviously visi ting some tourist area, and they’re going up to see some ruins.  “Ruins,” as a plural noun (and it is always used, in this sense, as a plural noun), is what is le ft of an old building or group of buildings, usually something that is very old, so mething that is of historical interest.  So when you go to Rome, in Italy, you can see the ruins of the Forum, a famous area in the center part of Rome.  You  can see what remains of the old buildings from the ancient Romans of 2,000 year s ago.  “Ruin,” however, has a couple of different meanings in English, both as a  verb and a noun.  Take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explana tions.

Chiu says that it will be worth your while.  The expressi on “to be worth your while” means that it is worth the effort; if you do i t, it will have something very pleasant or nice at the end that will justify what you a re doing – that will be a

  good reason for doing what you’re doing.  Chiu says, “Tr ust me (have trust in me).  Pick up the pace or we won’t get there before su nset!”  “To pick up the pace” (pace) means to increase your speed, to move more qu ickly, to hurry up. It’s similar to “get a move on,” although “get a move o n” is usually a command. Here, he’s also using the expression as a command, “pick up  your pace,” but it could be use otherwise.  For example: “The cyclist picked up  per pace in trying to win the race.”  She decided to go faster.

Sarah says, “It’s not like I’m dawdling here.”  “It’s not  like” means I am not – I am not dawdling.  “To dawdle” (dawdle) means to move very  slowly, to take a long time to do something or to go somewhere.  It’s a critici sm to say someone is dawdling; they’re wasting time, they’re not moving as fa st as they could because they’re lazy or for whatever reason.  Sarah says, “I may be moving at a snail’s pace, but this is as fast as I can manage without keeling o ver.”  A “snail’s pace” means very, very slowly.  A “snail” is a small animal that ha s the reputation for moving very slowly.  So, “to move at a snail’s pace” means t o move very slowly. She says, “this is as fast as I can manage (as fast as I can wa lk) without keeling over.”  “To keel (keel) over” is a two-word phrasal verb m eaning to fall over or fall down because you are very tired, or perhaps because you are  very sick – very ill. Somebody once said to me, “Hey, Jeff.  You should run a  marathon,” the 26-plus miles that people race sometimes, and I say, “If I ran a  marathon, I would probably keel over after the first two miles,” meaning  I would be so tired that I wouldn’t survive – which is probably true!

Sarah says, “If you’re in such a hurry, you can sprint up the re by yourself.”  “To sprint” means to run very quickly over a short distance.  In t he Olympics, they have a competition for the runner who can run the faste st 100 meters.  We call these runners “sprinters,” they run very fast, but for short  distances.  The opposite would be a “long distance runner,” someone wh o can run for miles and miles.  Sarah tells Chiu he can sprint up there by himse lf.  She says, “Go ahead. Impress me with your blinding speed.”  “Blinding,” here , means very fast, very impressive, making you amazed at how fast or how well some one does something.  “Blind” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Here, it means very impressive.

Chiu says, “I’m not about to leave you here all by yourself .”  I’m not going to let you be by yourself, I’m going to stay with you.  Sarah says, “Why?  Do you feel sorry for me?”  Do you have sympathy for me?  Do you feel  badly because I am experiencing something difficult or painful?  Chiu says, “ Yes, I always feel sorry for the physically challenged.”  This is a joke.  “To be ph ysically challenged” means that your body is not able to do what other bodie s can do because of

  some injury or perhaps you were born with a certain di sease or illness. “Physically challenged” is a term that is fairly new; you wi ll also hear people talk about “physical disabilities,” that means something simila r.  The older term for that would be “handicapped,” which is still used.  Peop le talk about the handicapped parking spaces; these are special spaces that are supposed to be used only for people who have some physical disability – who  are physically challenged in some way.

Sarah says, “Oh, yeah?  Better physically challenged than me ntally challenged!” She says, “Oh, yeah?” meaning “you think so?” Usually we use that expression when you’re angry with someone or you’re about to repl y to someone’s insult. She replies to Chiu’s insult – Chiu’s joke by saying, “Bett er physically challenged than mentally challenged,” meaning it is better to be physically challenged – to have a physical disability than to be mentally challenged.  “Mentally challenged” is someone who has some sort of mental illness, someone wh o has a medical condition that prevents them from being able to think properly.  Once again, this is a more modern, more recent term.  It’s probably used more now as a joke than as an actual description.  Somebody says, “Why did you do such a stupid thing, are you mentally challenged?” meaning do you have some sor t of intellectual problem.  It can be use, basically, to say that someone is d umb, but the more technical meaning is someone who would have a mental il lness or something that makes them unable to be able to reason and think as a normal human being would be able to do.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Chiu:  Come on, slowpoke, hurry up!  We’ll never get to  the top of the hill if you don’t get a move on.

Sarah:  There’s no way you’re going to get me to move a t breakneck speed.  I’ve gone up at least 500 steps already, and my legs are about  to fall off.  Tell me again why we’re trudging up this hill?

Chiu:  It’s the only way to the ruins and the view from there will really be worth your while.  Trust me.  Pick up the pace or we won’t get  there before sunset!

Sarah:  It’s not like I’m dawdling here.  I may be movi ng at a snail’s pace, but this is as fast as I can manage without keeling over.  If you’r e in such a hurry, you can sprint up there by yourself.  Go ahead.  Impress me w ith your blinding speed.

  Chiu:  I’m not about to leave you here all by yourself.

Sarah:  Why?  Do you feel sorry for me?

Chiu:  Yes, I always feel sorry for the physically challenged .

Sarah:  Oh, yeah?  Better physically challenged than men tally challenged!

# Using a Computer Keyboard

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 36: Using a Computer Keyboard.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 536.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Using a Computer Keyboard,” somet hing that all of us probably do every day.  It’s going to talk about some specif ic vocabulary we use when talking about a keyboard.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Leslie:  This keyboard is so hard to use.  I can’t find wh ere anything is!

Dave:  It’s a standard QWERTY keyboard.  The layout may be  a little different, with the function keys on the right-hand side instead of on the top, but you’ll get used to it in no time.

Leslie:  That’s what you think.  I don’t need an ergono mic wireless keyboard.  I liked my old one.

Dave:  Everybody in the office is getting one, so you weren ’t singled out.  Okay, let me give you a quick orientation.  The keyboard has a built-in number pad, and all you need to do is press the “num lock” key to use it.  The escape (“esc”) key is over here, and the “control,” “alt,” and “shift” keys a re on the bottom.

Leslie:  Where’s the “caps lock”?

Dave:  It’s on your left.

Leslie:  But my old keyboard had a bunch of hotkeys.  What am I supposed to do without them?

 Dave:  You can program your function keys to act as hotkeys.  Do you want me to show you how to do that?

Leslie:  I guess so.  Since I’m stuck with this keyboard, I g uess I have to live with it.

Dave:  That’s the spirit!

[end of dialogue]

Leslie begins our dialogue by saying, “This keyboard is so h ard to use.”  The “keyboard,” as you probably know, is the flat, rectangula r part of the computer that has buttons on it that you press down in order to e nter information into a computer.  Leslie says, “I can’t find where anything is (I can’t locate anything)!”

Dave says, “It’s a standard QWERTY keyboard.”  “QWERTY” (QW ERTY) is used to describe a keyboard design, the most common keyboard desig n in English, where the letters Q-W-E-R-T-Y are the first letters i n the top row when you read them from left to right.  This is a QWERTY keyboard, Da ve says, “The layout may be a little different, with the function keys on the  right side instead of on the top, but you’ll get used to it in no time.”  A “lay out” is a way that we organize things; it’s the position of individual pieces of somethi ng.  You can talk about the layout of a house, how the house is designed – where the  bedrooms are, where the bathrooms are.  “Layout,” here, refers to the po sition of the keys – the “keys” are the buttons that you press, that’s why we call it a keyboard.  The position of the keys is the layout for the keyboard.  Dave is saying that  the function keys for this keyboard are on the right-hand side – on the right  of the keyboard – instead of on the top.  “Function keys” are the ones that say “F1 , F2, F3,” and so on to “F12” that are used in some computers for specific comman ds, things that the computer does if you press one of those keys.

Dave says that Leslie will get used to it in no time, me aning very quickly.  Leslie says, “That’s what you think,” meaning that’s your opinion,  but it isn’t true. “That’s what you think.  I don’t need an ergonomic wire less keyboard.  I liked my old one.”  The word “ergonomic” (ergonomic) is an adj ective we use to describe equipment, technology, or furniture that is made to be  more efficient to use, so that it doesn’t hurt your body.  For example, an ergon omic chair would be a chair that you could sit in for a long time and it wouldn’t hurt your back.  An ergonomic keyboard is designed so that you can use it without hurting  your hands – without getting any sort of pain in your hands.  It’s supposed t o be designed to prevent that.  “Wireless” keyboards are keyboards that you don’t h ave a physical wire to

 connect the keyboard to the computer.  Wireless – without wires.  Many keyboards and mouses nowadays are wireless, my keyboard and mo use are wireless for example.

Leslie said she liked her old keyboard.  Dave says, “Everybody i n the office is getting one (is getting these new keyboards), so you were n’t singled out.”  “To single (someone) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to treat  someone differently than everyone else, especially if it’s something a person  doesn’t like.  For example, the teacher may say, “Everyone needs to write a f ive-page essay (a five-page paper),” and one of the students complains abo ut it, the teacher could say, “Well, you are not being singled out.  Everyone has to do this.”  So, Leslie is not being singled out.  By the way, the word “single” has a couple of different meanings in English.  For those meanings, take a look at our Learning Guide for this episode.

Dave says, “Okay, let me give you a quick orientation.”  The  word “orientation,” here, means an overview, when someone gives you basic infor mation to make you familiar with something, to give you some important  information.  When you start a new job you may attend a company orientation, wh ere they give you information about things that are important for you to know in that company. “Orientation,” however, has other meanings, just like the word “single.”  You can find those meanings in our Learning Guide for this epi sode.

Dave says, “This keyboard has a built-in number pad.”  When  we say something is “built-in,” we’re describing something that is a per manent part of something else; it wasn’t added separately, it was made that way.  For example, you could have a built-in closet (that is a place where you keep your  clothes).  In my room – in my bedroom, I have a built-in closet.  It’s not a sepa rate piece of furniture that we bought and put in my room, it was part of the room ; it was built that way. “Built” is the past tense of “build.”  So, something t hat is “built-in” is a permanent part of it.  Many keyboards have a built-in number pad .  The “number pad” is a small, usually square or rectangular part of a keyboard t hat has just numbers as well as a few mathematical symbols.  Number pads are usefu l for entering numbers in very quickly.  In fact, some people are very fast  when they use their number pads.  Dave says, “all you need to do is press the ‘n um lock’ key to use it.”  On some keyboards the number pad is separate from t he rest of the keys.  In some keyboards, however, it’s part of the keys, and you have to press a special key – a special button to use it, and that is typically calle d the “num (num) lock” (“num” stands for “number”).

He says, “The escape key (‘esc’) is over here.”  On a keyboard,  “esc” means escape, often used to get out of a program or to perha ps undo something that

 you did.  He says, “the ‘control,’ ‘alt’ (alt), and ‘shi ft’ keys are on the bottom.” These are special keys used on keyboards for specific commands or functions on computers.  The “control” key is usually pressed with anot her key to do something in a computer program.  For example, on Wind ows, when you are in the program Microsoft Word and you press control-z (the letter “z”) you will undo your previous action.  The “alt” key is similar; the alt key is usually pressed with another key to do something.  It’s often used to open me nus in a computer program.  The “shift” key is the key you press to make capi tal letters (to make large letters).  It’s also, again, used as part of a com mand sometimes.  If you press control-alt-delete on a Windows machine that usuall y will turn your computer off; it will shut it down or give you that opt ion.

Leslie says, “Where’s the ‘caps lock’?”  The “caps lock” is the key, usually on the left side of the keyboard, that when pressed makes all of  the letters capital letters.  It’s like having the shift key always being pressed .  The word “caps” (caps) stands for “capitals” or “capital letters.”

Dave says to Leslie, “The caps lock is on your left.”  Leslie says, “But my old keyboard had a bunch of hotkeys.”  “Hotkeys” are additional  keys or buttons that you can press to make the computer do certain things.  On so me computer programs, you can often “program” the hotkeys, make certai n combination of keys or certain keys command buttons so that when you press the m something happens right away.  Leslie says, “What am I supposed to do without them?” This Leslie really likes to complain, doesn’t she?  Dave sa ys, “You can program your function keys to act as hotkeys.  Do you want me to show yo u how to do that?”  Leslie says, “I guess so.  Since I’m stuck with this ke yboard, I guess I have to live with it.”  “To be stuck with (something)” me ans to be forced to do something or be forced to use something that you don’t want to use.  Leslie feels that she’s stuck with this keyboard, meaning she doesn’t ha ve any other choice, but she’s not very happy about it.  Leslie is a very unhapp y person, it seems! She says, “I guess I have to live with it.”  “To have to l ive with (something)” means you have to put up with it, you have to tolerate i t.

Dave jokingly says, “That’s the spirit!”  Normally, “that’s the spirit” is a phrase used to encourage the other person to continue doing what they are doing, to have a positive attitude.  But here, it’s used sarcasticall y, as a joke, since Leslie has a very negative attitude.  I think Leslie needs to lo ok for a new job, personally!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Leslie:  This keyboard is so hard to use.  I can’t find wh ere anything is!

Dave:  It’s a standard QWERTY keyboard.  The layout may be  a little different, with the function keys on the right-hand side instead of on the top, but you’ll get used to it in no time.

Leslie:  That’s what you think.  I don’t need an ergono mic wireless keyboard.  I liked my old one.

# Types of Bank Accounts

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 37: Types of Bank Accounts.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 537.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension qu estions, and a complete transcript of everything we say.

This episode is called “Types of Bank Accounts.”  It’s a dialo gue between Luiz and Iona, going through some of the common vocabulary we  use when talking about the special arrangements or agreements you have wit h a bank when you give them your money.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Luiz:  Where are you going?

Iona:  I’m going to the bank to open an account.

Luiz:  What kind of account: a savings account, a checking accoun t, or a CD?

Iona:  Um, I’m not sure, but I’m sure someone at the bank can help me decide.

Luiz:  You’ll also need to decide if you want an intere st-earning account or not, and don’t forget to ask for free checking.  Pick a bank th at doesn’t have monthly service charges.

Iona:  Okay, thanks…

Luiz:  And make sure you know if there’s a minimum bala nce required, because if the account dips below that minimum, you’ll be charged a  fee.

Iona:  Yes, right, I’ll be sure to do that.  Well, I ’d better get going…

 Luiz:  You probably want to open a checking and a savings a ccount, so make sure you link those accounts.  That should give you overdraft  protection, in case you ever bounce a check.

Iona:  Okay, I’ll definitely keep all of that in mind.  I’d better go.  Samil is waiting for me.

Luiz:  Are you thinking of opening a joint account with your boyfriend?

Iona:  We’re considering it…

Luiz:  Pool your money and open a CD.  That way, you’ll  lock in a good interest rate and neither of you can touch the money until the CD matures.

Iona:  We’ll think about it.  Thanks.

Luiz:  Oh, and…

Iona:  Would you like to come with us to the bank and help us open our accounts?

Luiz:  Really?  But I don’t want to interfere.

Iona:  You, interfere?  I can’t imagine you ever trying  to interfere.

[end of dialogue]

Luiz begins by asking Iona, “Where are you going?”  Iona says, “I’m going to the bank to open an account.”  Luiz says, “What kind of account:  a savings account, a checking account, or a CD?”  A “savings account” is a bank account designed to hold your money that you are saving, and usually to pay you a small percentage of what we would call “interest.”  It’s mone y that the bank gives you for using your money, because banks, of course, don’t just t ake your money and put it in a safe place, they lend that money out to oth er people.  They let other people use your money, and those other people pay the b ank interest.  But here, the bank pays you interest – you extra money.  A “checking acc ount” is a bank account that holds money that you can use to write checks with .  A “check” is a small piece of paper; basically it’s a promise to pay a cert ain amount of money. You give someone this check, and they can take it to their b ank and the bank will get the money from your checking account.  Checking accounts so metimes also offer interest, it depends on the account.  A “CD” stand s for a certificate of deposit.  It’s a special bank account where you give the ban k usually a large

 amount of money, more than 10,000 dollars typically – i t could be up to a million dollars or more – and you give this to the bank and you a gree not to touch it for a certain amount of time.  It’s like a savings account, but  you can’t just go to the bank and take your money out; you have to leave it there for 60 days, 90 days, a year, maybe up to five years.  The bank then give you more  interest; it gives you a higher what we would call “rate of interest,” it a llows you to get more money for putting your money with this bank.  In the United State s, CDs are popular ways of saving a lot of money.  If you have a lot of money that yo u don’t want to invest – don’t want to put elsewhere, you can put it into a CD .

Iona says, “Um, I’m not sure, but I’m sure someone at the  bank can help me decide.”  Luiz says, “You’ll also need to decide if you wan t an interest-earning account or not.”  We’ve already described “interest” as the  percentage of money that the band gives you back for allowing the bank to u se your money.  “Interest- earning” just refers to an account that earns interest, that’s the verb we use.  You earn interest – you get money for your money.  The verb “earn” can also mean to get money from a job.  I work; I earn money from my job  – not a lot of money, but some money!

Luiz says, “don’t forget to ask for free checking.”  In some banks, the bank charges you a fee for having a checking account or for not h aving enough money in your checking account.  “Free checking” is a checking account where the bank does not charge you any money; it doesn’t charge you a fee.  Luiz says, “Pick a bank that doesn’t have monthly service charges.”  A “service cha rge” at a bank is the amount of money the bank makes you pay for certain ser vices such as using an automatic teller machine – an ATM, a machine that you go and you put a card into and you get money out of from your account.  Some  banks have service charges for using ATMs.  Some banks in the U.S. now have service charges if you want to go into the bank and talk to a real human being.  That’s sort of strange, but it’s true at a lot of banks, especially big b anks nowadays.  These would all be called service charges.

Iona says, “Okay, thanks…” but Luiz has more advice.  Luiz says, “ And make sure you know if there’s a minimum balance required.”  “Make sure” means get this piece of information, be confident about this piece  of information, that you know it, be sure.  He says, “make sure you know if there’s a minimum balance.” A “minimum balance” is the minimum, or least amount of  money that you have to keep in your bank account.  Usually, banks require a minimum  balance – “balance” is just the amount of money in your account – in  order to have an account without service charges.  So in some banks, you have t o have a minimum balance of, say, 1,000 dollars, or 5,000 dollar s.  If you don’t have that amount, the bank will charge you a service charge.  Luiz says,  “if the account

 dips below that minimum, you’ll be charged a fee,” a s ervice charge.  “To dip below” means to fall below a certain number or amoun t, to be less than a certain number or amount.  You could say, “The temperature dip ped below 30 degrees Fahrenheit last night,” meaning it got below; it wen t lower than 30 degrees.  So, if your bank has a 5,000-dollar minimum balance and you h ave less than 5,000 dollars, because you took some money out, you would dip b elow the minimum balance.

Iona says, “Yes, right, I’ll be sure to do that.  Well, I’d better get going…”  This is a polite way of saying I need to leave now.  Iona wants Luiz to stop talking to her, stop giving her advice.  Luiz, however, continues to give a dvice.  He says, “You probably want to open a checking and a savings account, so make sure you link those accounts.”  “To link” (link) is to connect, to tie th ings together.  At many banks, you can have both a savings account and a checking accoun t.  You link the accounts together so you can move money from one account  to the other easily.  Luiz says linking the checking and savings accounts will give Iona overdraft protection, “in case you ever bounce a check.”  “Ove rdraft protection” is a service where the bank will pay a check even if you don’t h ave enough money in your checking account.  It’s used to protect people in ca se, or in the event that, they bounce a check.  “To bounce a check” means to write a check, to give someone a promise that you are going to pay them, but n ot having enough money in your account.  So, if you give someone a check for  500 dollars, and you only have 250 dollars in your account, that would be bouncing a check. Some people do that accidentally; some people do it pur posely, in which case they can get into trouble, including legal trouble.  “ Bounce” has several different meanings in English, as does the word “link,” which we use d a minute ago.  For both of those words, take a look at our Learning Guide for additional explanations.

I should explain that the word “draft,” in this case, me ans the same as withdrawal.  “To withdraw” money from an account mea ns to take it out.  So, an “overdraft” is when you try to draw to much money out of your account, such as the example of our bounced check.

Iona says, “Okay, I’ll definitely keep all of that in mind  (I’ll try to remember all of that).  I’d better go.”  “I’d better go” is another polite way of saying I have to go now – shut up!  “Samil is waiting for me,” Iona says.  L uiz says, “Are you thinking of opening a joint account with your boyfriend?”  A “jo int account” is an account where you have two or more people who are officially or  legally on the account we would say, meaning both of their names are on the account, they both can use the account.  Luiz is asking Iona if she plans to open a joint account with her boyfriend, perhaps they’re getting married soon.  Iona says, “We’re considering it

 (we’re thinking about it).”  Luiz says, “Pool your money and open a CD.”  “To pool (pool) your money” means to combine your money.  To pool  anything means to combine things.  Usually, for example, if you are in a g roup and you all need to do something together, you might pool your resources, the  things that you have in order to accomplish your task or goal.  In this case, you would pool your money; you would put your money together and, Luiz is re commending, open a CD (a certificate of deposit).  He says, “That way, you’ll lock in a good interest rate.”  “To lock in” in this case means to agree on an in terest rate that will not change over time, or to agree on a price that will not  change over time.  When you buy a house in the United States and you get a special  loan for that house, what we call a “mortgage” from a bank, you can lock in yo ur interest rate.  You can say, “Okay, I want this particular interest rate,” and  the bank guarantees it; it agrees that it won’t change it; it won’t make it go up .  This is a way of protecting you.

Luiz says, “you’ll lock in a good interest rate,” remember the interest rate is the percentage of money that either the bank will pay you for putting money in a savings account or CD, or that you pay the bank when the ba nk loans you money.  Luiz says, “neither of you can touch the money unti l the CD matures.” “To touch the money,” here, means you can’t take the money out.  That’s what a CD is; it’s when you give the money – your money to the b ank for a long period of time, and you are not allowed to take the money back.   “To mature,” here, means for a financial arrangement to reach the end of a specified or agreed period.  In other words, if you have a one-year CD it will mature 12 months from today, and on that date then you can get your money back  and get the interest that the bank paid you.  That’s what we mean by a CD ma turing, it comes to the end of the time that you agreed to leave the money the re.

Finally, Iona says, “We’ll think about it.  Thanks.”  Lu iz says, “Oh, and…”  Iona says, “Would you like to come with us to the bank and help  us open our accounts?”  Iona isn’t really serious, but she’s saying to L uiz you’re giving me too much advice now.  Luiz says, “Really?  But I don’t want to  interfere.”  “To interfere” means to become involved in someone else’s busin ess or someone else’s personal life, especially if that person doesn’t wan t you to be involved – doesn’t want you to help.  Iona says, “You, interfere?  I can’t imagine you ever trying to interfere.”  Iona’s being sarcastic; she’s making a joke because Luiz has been giving all of this advice that Iona didn’t actually ask him for.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Luiz:  Where are you going?

Iona:  I’m going to the bank to open an account.

Luiz:  What kind of account: a savings account, a checking accoun t, or a CD?

This episode is called “Finding the Perfect Gift.”  It’s a dialogue between Fae and Pablo about someone who’s looking to find a gift.  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Fae:  Help!  I still need to buy a gift for my mother  and I can’t seem to think of the perfect present, something that’ll really knock her socks off.

Pablo:  Why don’t you just get her a gift certificate or  a gift card?  That way, she can pick out her own gift.

Fae:  Oh, she would hate that.  She would think that I didn’t put any thought into buying her a present at all, while I’ve been racking my brain to think of something she’ll like.  Maybe I should buy her a car!

Pablo:  Now, don’t get carried away.  You get like thi s every year.  I know you want to please your mother, but remember, it’s the th ought that counts.

Fae:  I wish that were true.  If I get her the wrong  gift, I’m afraid she’ll be disappointed, or worse, she’ll hold it against me for t he rest of my life.

Pablo:  It boggles my mind how you can work yourself up l ike this every year.

Fae:  How can I not?  You know my mother.

Pablo:  Yes, I do, and I have one piece of advice for you : Buy her a gift she can return.

[end of dialogue]

 Fae says to Pablo, “Help!  I still need to buy a gift for my mother and I can’t seem to think of the perfect present, something that’ll real ly knock her socks off.”  A “gift” and a “present” are the same thing; it’s someth ing that you give another person.  A gift is something that you don’t expect the ot her person to give you anything in exchange for; you’re not asking the other p erson to give you any money.  Gifts and presents are always free, although it has become popular in the last few years on television to talk about how people  could get a free gift.  But all gifts – all presents are, by definition, free.  Fa e says, “I can’t seem to think of the perfect present, something that’ll really knock her so cks off.”  “To knock (someone’s) socks off” is an informal expression meaning to i mpress someone very much, to do something that surprises someone but in a  good way – in a unexpected way.

Pablo says, “Why don’t you just get her a gift certificate  or a gift card?”  A “gift certificate” is a piece of paper that you buy at a store t hat you give to someone, and it allows that person to go to that store and use it to buy things.  A “gift card” is similar except it looks like a little credit card, and yo u are able to give that to someone and they can buy whatever they want.  Pablo says, “ That way (meaning by doing that, by buying her a gift card), sh e can pick out her own gift.” “To pick out” is a phrasal verb meaning to choose, to sele ct, to decide which of something you want.  Some people don’t like that.  In  fact, Fae says, “Oh, (her mother) would hate that.  She would think that I did n’t put any thought into buying her a present at all.”  “To put thought into (somethi ng)” means to think about something carefully, to think of all the options, to th ink what of what that person’s opinion would be, what their likes and dislikes are, and  to choose something carefully, just for that person.  A gift card or a gift certificate means that you really haven’t thought about it at all, and you just picked a store and you gave them a gift card for it.  So, many people don’t like gift card s and gift certificates, but they’re very popular.

Fae says, “I’ve been racking my brain to think of something she’ll like.”  “To rack (rack) your brain” means to spend a lot of time thinkin g about something, especially something that’s very difficult – a problem that ’s very difficult to solve. In this case, the problem is which gift Fae should buy her  mother.  “Maybe I should buy her a car,” she says.  Pablo says, “Now, don’t ge t carried away.”  “To get carried away” means to do too much of something, t o take something to an extreme; we might also say “to go overboard.”  “To get ca rried away” means to do too much of something.  The verb “carry,” however, ha s many different meanings.  You know where to look, our Learning Guide,  where you can find additional explanations.

 Pablo says, “You get like this every year (meaning you get into this way of thinking every year).  I know you want to please your mothe r, but remember, it’s the thought that counts.”  “To please (someone)” means to make someone happy, someone you like, someone that you are trying to sa tisfy.  “Please” has a couple of different meanings, however; once again, take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.  Pablo says, “it’s the  thought that counts.” This is an expression – a phrase we have that means even i f the person doesn’t like the gift, they will appreciate the thought that w ent behind it: the fact that you tried to find something good for them.  “It’s the tho ught that counts.”

Fae says, “I wish that were true (meaning that’s not tru e for my mother).  If I get her the wrong gift, I’m afraid she’ll be disappointe d.”  “To be disappointed” means you’re unhappy because someone didn’t do what you expected or something didn’t result in the way that you wanted it to.  Fae sa ys, “worse, she’ll hold it against me for the rest of my life.”  “To hold (some thing) against (someone)” is another phrasal verb meaning not to forgive someone for something that happened, to continue to be angry at someone for someth ing that happened in the past.  Fae thinks that her mother will be mad at h er for the rest of her life – which could be a very long time!

Pablo says, “It boggles my mind how you can work yourself up  like this every year.”  “To boggle (boggle) (someone’s) mind” means to confuse someone, to do something that is very surprising, very confusing, very difficul t for another person to understand.  It means that you’re really confused abou t something; you’re really surprised about something.  “Why my brother decided  to leave his job boggles my mind,” I’m completely confused by it.  Usually we  use this expression when we somehow disapprove or disagree with whatever the  outcome or result was.

Pablo says it boggles his mind how Fae works herself up li ke this every year. “To work yourself up” means to get very worried about som ething or to get very angry about something.  If your girlfriend decides to en d your relationship, your friend might say, “Don’t get worked up about it (don’t  get worried about it; don’t get angry about it).  There are other fish in the sea (is an expression we would use in that case).”  “There are other fish in the sea ( in the ocean)” meaning there are other women out there that you can find to be you r girlfriend – maybe!

Fae says, “How can I not (meaning how can I not work myself  up)?  You know my mother.”  Pablo says, “Yes, I do, and I have one piece  of advice for you (a piece of advice is one thing that you are recommending to  someone): Buy her a gift she can return.”  “To return” here means to take something back to the store where you bought it so that you can get something else, or they will give you the

 money was paid for the gift.  We actually have what are called “gift receipts,” which are popular, I’m sure, in other places.  These are  receipts that the store will give a person; it doesn’t have the amount of the purch ase – the amount that you paid, but it allows the person to bring back to a store to exchange it for something else.  Of course once they bring it back, then they’ll know  how much it was, so it’s kind of a silly practice really, but that is what a gi ft receipt is, when you are going to return something.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Fae:  Help!  I still need to buy a gift for my mother  and I can’t seem to think of the perfect present, something that’ll really knock her socks off.

Pablo:  Why don’t you just get her a gift certificate or  a gift card?  That way, she can pick out her own gift.

# Spending Time with Family

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 39: Spending Time with Family.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 539.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Spending Time with Family.”  It’ s a dialogue between Claus and Marcia about spending a lot of time with your  family, something that can be a good thing, although sometimes it can be a di fficult thing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Claus:  Go home.  You need to spend more time with you r loved ones before they report you missing.

Marcia:  This is the busy season.  Do you think I have time  to stop to smell the roses when I have work coming out of my ears?

Claus:  It’s true we’re busy, but you get too wrapped up  in your work.  How old are your daughters?

Marcia:  They’re six and nine.

Claus:  Right.  Before you know it, they’ll be grown a nd you’ll have missed out on their childhood.  Take it from someone who knows.  Don’ t take your family for granted.

Marcia:  I know you’re right.  I need to spend more qu ality time with them – just as soon as the busy season is over.

Claus:  Time slips by while you’re not paying attention.  Look at me.  I worked my butt off to get where I am now, but at what cost?  M y wife and I are practically strangers and I barely know my children.  You don’t want  to end up like me.

 Marcia:  So I should see you as a cautionary tale?

Claus:  Yup.  Consider this a public service announcement.

[end of dialogue]

We’re at work with Claus and Marcia.  Claus says to Marci a, “Go home.  You need to spend more time with your loved ones before t hey report you missing.” “Your loved ones” are the people you love, usually your cl ose relatives, your family.  “To report (someone) missing” means to go usual ly to the police to officially say that you don’t know where this other person  is, so the police may start looking for that person.  Claus is joking here; he’ s saying that Marcia has been away from her family so much that they will think she  has disappeared.

Marcia says, “This is a busy season.”  A “busy season” is a time  of the year when there is a lot of work to do, more work than normal.  Marcia says, “Do you think I have time to stop to smell the roses when I have work comi ng out of my ears?” “To stop to smell the roses,” or “to stop and smell the roses” means to relax, to take time to do things that are perhaps not very importa nt but that are very pleasant.  There was actually a song, I think in the 1970 s:

You gotta stop and smell the roses .

That’s all I remember, just that line.  I think that w as Mac Davis, remember him? No, me neither!  Marcia says, “I have work coming out of m y ears.”  The expression “to have (something) come out of your ears” mea ns that you have too much of something; you’re overwhelmed by all the things t hat you have or things that you have to do.  In this case, Marcia has too many thi ngs to do.

Claus says, “It’s true we’re busy, but you get too wrapped up in your work.”  “To be wrapped (wrapped) up” means to be very involved in som ething, thinking about something so much that you forget about everything  else, you’re absorbed. Typically, we use this when we’re talking about work or so me commitments. Claus says, “How old are your daughters?”  Marcia says, “The y’re six and nine.” Claus says, “Right.  Before you know it (before you realize ), they’ll be grown and you’ll have missed out on their childhood.”  “To miss out on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning not to be able to enjoy something,  to lose or waste an opportunity.  “Don’t miss out on the sale on televisions a t the store,” don’t lose the opportunity to take advantage of it.  Claus is telli ng Marcia not to miss out on the childhood of her children; he says, “Take it from some one who knows.”  This expression, “take it from someone who knows,” or “take it  from someone who

 (plus another verb)” means listen to my advice; learn from  another person’s experience.  If somebody asked me about the freeways here i n Los Angeles, I would say, “Well, take it from someone who drives a lot o n the freeway, they’re terrible.”  Which is true!  Claus says, “Don’t take your f amily for granted.”  “To take (something or someone) for granted” means not to a ppreciate something or someone; to think that you’ll always have this thing or th is person in your life, and so you don’t make any effort to keep it, him, or her.  That’s to take something for granted, to assume that you will always have it.

Marcia says, “I know you’re right.  I need to spend more quality time with them.” “Quality time” is a period of time where you’re truly f ocused on another person; you try to get as much enjoyment from that other person a s possible.  Marcia says, “just as soon as the busy season is over,” meaning I’ll spend time with them as soon as the busy season is over.

Claus says, “Time slips by while you’re not paying attention .”  “To slip by” means to pass almost without noticing, to happen without you r ealizing it.  Time goes quickly, you don’t even realize how fast it is going by; it is passing.  “Slip,” as well as the word “wrap” that we talked about earlier, have a couple of different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations. So, Claus is saying to Marcia, “Time slips by while you’re n ot paying attention.” He says, “Look at me (consider me, for example).  I worked my butt off to get where I am now.”  “To work your butt (butt) off” is a n informal expression meaning to work very hard, to put a lot of effort into  doing something.  Claus says, “I worked my butt off to get where I am now (to g et to my current position in the company), but at what cost?”  This is a phrase we use t o talk about something that we were able to achieve but it had a l ot of negative consequences.  Some athletes use drugs (steroids) to become champions, but at what cost?  They could be hurting their body.

Claus says, “My wife and I are practically strangers and I ba rely know my children.”  A “stranger” is someone you don’t know or som eone you’ve never met before.  He, of course, is exaggerating; they’re not str angers, they know each other; they’re married to each other.  But because he h as spent so much time away from her, they don’t know each other as well; they’r e not as close anymore. He says, “I barely know my children,” meaning I almost don’ t know them or I don’t know them very well.  Claus says, “You don’t want to  end up like me.”  “To end up” means to become, in this case; to result in af ter a long period of time.

Marcia says, “So I should see you as a cautionary tale?”  A  “cautionary tale” is a story about something sad or dangerous that has happened to another person, and it makes you want to change your own behavior.  You start thinking about

 that, and you think, “Oh, I don’t want that to happe n to me.”  A “tale” (tale) is another word for a story.  “Cautionary” comes from “ca ution,” meaning be careful. So, it’s a story that warns you about something bad that could happen if you’re not careful.

Claus says, “Yup,” which is an informal way of saying yes – yup .  The opposite of “yup” is “nope” (nope).  Those are informal ways of sayin g yes (yup) and no (nope).  Claus says, “Yup.  Consider this a public service an nouncement.” “Consider,” here, means think about this in a certain way, think about this statement.  “Consider this (meaning his story) a public ser vice announcement.” A “public service announcement,” sometimes abbreviated “PS A,” is an advertisement on the radio or television that is not for any product or service; it’s not somebody trying to make money.  Instead, it’s from the  government or from social groups that are trying to get people to change their behavior or to give them information they need to know.  For example, ther e might be a PSA – a public service announcement about getting a flu shot; it  tells you about the importance of that.  Here, Claus is sort of joking, sayi ng my story is like a public service announcement, it’s giving you information you need to know.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Claus:  Go home.  You need to spend more time with you r loved ones before they report you missing.

Marcia:  This is the busy season.  Do you think I have time  to stop to smell the roses when I have work coming out of my ears?

Claus:  It’s true we’re busy, but you get too wrapped up  in your work.  How old are your daughters?

Marcia:  They’re six and nine.

Claus:  Right.  Before you know it, they’ll be grown a nd you’ll have missed out on their childhood.  Take it from someone who knows.  Don’ t take your family for granted.

Marcia:  I know you’re right.  I need to spend more qu ality time with them – just as soon as the busy season is over.

 Claus:  Time slips by while you’re not paying attention.  Look at me.  I worked my butt off to get where I am now, but at what cost?  M y wife and I are practically strangers and I barely know my children.  You don’t want  to end up like me.

Marcia:  So I should see you as a cautionary tale?

Claus:  Yup.  Consider this a public service announcement.

This episode is called “Promoting a New Product.”  It’s a  dialogue between Zoila and Leo using vocabulary that would be associated, or rela ted to promoting or trying to sell a new business product.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Zoila:  I haven’t seen you around lately.  What have you been up to?

Leo:  My business partners and I have been putting the fi nal touches on our new line of energy drinks.

Zoila:  Really?  I didn’t even know that you were in t he beverage business.

Leo:  Yeah, we’ve branched out into a few other area s.  We’re going to start promoting the new drinks very soon.  We’re working with an advertising agency and we’ll start with sponsoring a couple of sporting even ts.

Zoila:  Wow, when am I going to start seeing ads on TV ?

Leo:  I don’t think we’re going to go that route just  yet.

Zoila:  Are you taking the new products to trade shows?

Leo:  No, no trade shows for us.  We’re working on prod uct placement in some music videos and maybe a TV show or two.

 Zoila:  That’s great.  What about tie-ins with other  products or with a movie?  I see those everywhere.

Leo:  We’re considering it.  We’re working on a couple  of endorsement deals right now.  Once we have some celebrities on board, we’l l do even more.

Zoila:  It would be great if you could get Jeff McQuill an to endorse your products. Everybody knows he’s the greatest baseball player who ever l ived.  With him plugging your energy drinks, sales will go through the ro of.

Leo:  Yeah, but I think we’d be shooting too high.  W e might have to settle for someone a little less famous – like David Beckham or Lance Armstrong.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Zoila saying, “I haven’t seen yo u around lately.  What have you been up to?” meaning what have you been doing.   Leo says, “My business partners and I have been putting the final tou ches on our new line of energy drinks.”  Leo has a business, and the people who ow n the business with him are called his “business partners.”  They’ve been put ting the final touches on something.  “To put the final touches on (something)” m eans to do the last, usually minor things that you need to finish a project, t o complete the final steps of something.  You could say, “I’m writing a report for  my boss.  I’m almost done with it, I just need to put a title on it and put it  in a nice folder,” that would be putting the final touches on it.  Leo and his partners are putting the final touches on their new line of energy drinks.  Here, “line” refe rs to a group of related products that are sold by one company.  Coca-Cola Compan y has a line of soft drinks – of soda pops, or simply “soda.”  Coke, Diet Coke,  etc., those are all part of a group of related products, or a line.  “Line,” h owever, has several different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Well, Leo and his business partners are putting the fina l touches on the new line of energy drinks they have.  “Energy drinks” are drinks that  give you more energy, often have a lot of caffeine in them.  College  students sometimes use energy drinks when they need to study for an exam late at  night, especially when they should have been studying in the past and they wait u ntil the last minute.

Zoila says, “Really?  I didn’t even know that you were i n the beverage business.” A “beverage” is a drink.  Coffee is a beverage; alcohol i s a beverage; tea is a beverage.  At a restaurant, usually, the word that you use for the things that you

 are going to drink, or want to drink, is beverage.  The  waiter may ask you, “Would you like a beverage?”  Would you like something to drink?

Leo says, “Yeah, we’ve branched out into a few other are as.”  His company has branched out.  “To branch out” is a phrasal verb meaning  to expand into different areas or fields, to grow into some sort of new operatio n – new kind of business. The word “branch” comes from the part of the tree; we  call the parts of the tree that go out from the main section of the tree “branch es.”  That main section is called the “trunk.”  Well, Leo is branching out into ne w areas.  He says his company is going to start promoting the new drinks very soo n.  “To promote a product” means to tell other people about it; by telli ng them how good it is, trying to get other people interested so that they will want to buy the product.  We can use “promote” in a business sense for a new product or servi ce.  We also use the word “promote” in a business sense to mean when someone gets a better job. When they go from being vice president to president, we  say they’ve been promoted.

Leo says that he and his business partners are working with an advertising agency and that they will start with sponsoring a couple of sports events.  An “advertising agency” is a company that specializes in helping  other companies get people interested in buying their product; they may put a commercial on the television, or put an announcement in the newspaper.  T hat’s what an advertising agency does.  Traditionally, the largest advertising agen cies always had an office in New York City on one particular street called Madison  Avenue, and sometimes people will use the words or term Madison Avenue to r efer to advertising companies or people involved in publicity and promotion.

Leo says that they’re going to sponsor a couple of sporting  events.  “To sponsor” means to provide money for an event or a program and yo u, in return, get the opportunity to advertise your product or service to the p eople who are going to that event or program.  Many times a sporting event – a game will be sponsored by a particular company, so everyone who goes the game kn ows that this game was, in part, paid for by that company.  It’s a way of ad vertising, and also a way of showing that you are interested in helping the commu nity perhaps.

Zoila says, “Wow, when am I going to start seeing ads on TV?”  “Ad” is short for advertisement; we also would call those, on television, “co mmercials,” it’s the same thing.  A “commercial” would only be on the TV or the radio; an “ad” could be on TV, radio, or in a magazine or newspaper.  Leo says, “I don’t think we’re going to go that route just yet.”  “To go that route”  means to do that particular thing, to take a specific direction with your actions.  So you could say, “I was thinking about going and getting my master’s degree, bu t I decided not to go that

 route.”  I decided not to do that or those series of things.  Here, Leo is saying that they are not going to be putting commercials, or ads, on  the television.

Zoila then asks, “Are you taking the new products to trade  shows?”  A “trade show” is a large event, usually held in a big auditorium  or hotel, where companies that have similar products get together, typical ly once a year, to show their new products and their new services.  The word “tr ade” here simply refers to the business – the particular business.  So you could have a trade show for dentists, where all the companies that make products for d entists would get together so that other companies, or dentists themselves, co uld go and look and see what there was to buy.  Leo says, “No, no trade shows for us,” meaning we’re not going to any trade shows.  “We’re working on product placement in some music videos and maybe a TV show or two.”  “Product pl acement” is when a company tries to get its product as part of a movie, T V show, or other types of entertainment.  So you could be watching a TV show, an d somebody’s drinking a can of Coca-Cola.  Well, Coca-Cola probably paid the ma kers of that TV program to put their product in that TV program.  This happen s a lot in American television and in American movies.  That’s called product placemen t.

Zoila says, “That’s great.  What about tie-ins with othe r products or with a movie? I see those everywhere.”  A “tie-in” is a connection betw een two or more things, especially when you are trying to sell something related t o a movie or a TV show. So, you could have a famous movie such as Star Wars , and one of the tie-ins could be little dolls – a little doll of Chewbacca for example.  That would be a tie- in to the movie; it is related to the movie.  Leo says, “ We’re considering (tie-ins). We’re working on a couple of endorsement deals right no w.  Once we have some celebrities on board, we’ll do even more.”  An “endor sement” is when a famous person says that they like this product or service, and the y use that person’s name and his picture or part of a video to promote tha t product.  Usually these are famous sports stars, such as the golfer Tiger Woods, or entertainment stars that endorse, or say they like this product, and that, of course, gets other people interested in the product.  At least that’s the idea.  Leo says once they have some “celebrities,” famous people, on board, we’ll do e ven more.  “On board” here means agreeing to participate in something.

Zoila says, “It would be great if you could get Jeff McQui llan to endorse your products.  Everybody knows he’s the greatest baseball player who ever lived. With him plugging your energy drinks, sales will go thro ugh the roof.”  Zoila is suggesting that a very famous baseball player, whose name  is the same as mine, could endorse this product – these energy drinks.  S he says, “ With him plugging your energy drinks, sales will go through the ro of.”  “To plug” means to promote, to endorse, to say that you use this product and  you like it.  When we

 say “sales will go through the roof,” we mean that they will go to a very high amount, and usually go up very quickly.  So if Jeff McQuill an was plugging the product, they would sell a lot of the product very quickly.

Leo says, “Yeah, but I think we’d be shooting too high.  We might have to settle for someone a little less famous – like David Beckham or La nce Armstrong.”  “To shoot too high” means to try to do something that is to o difficult or something that is too out of reach – too advanced, perhaps.  So, they’ re saying here that Jeff McQuillan probably would not want to endorse or plug anything, he’s too famous, so they will have to settle for someone less famous.  “To se ttle for” means to accept something that isn’t your first choice; you really wa nted to have this, but you’ll settle for something a little less, something that  was your third or fourth choice for example.  “Settle” has a couple of different  meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Zoila:  I haven’t seen you around lately.  What have you been up to?

Leo:  My business partners and I have been putting the fi nal touches on our new line of energy drinks.

This episode is called “Reporting the News.”  It’s going to talk about some common vocabulary when dealing with the newspaper.  We thought we would do something about newspapers before they all disappear.  L et’s get started. > I have always wanted to be a news reporter.  When I was about 10 years old, I would write my own news stories and publish them in my o wn newspaper.  In reality, the newspaper was just a piece of paper on which  I’d written my stories and drew my pictures, but it was my first taste of the pow er of the press.
> When I got to college, I worked on the university newspa per and started out as a copy editor, editing stories and writing headlines.  Th en, I began to cover news events, getting my first bylines.  I can’t tell you how excit ed I was to see my name in print for the first time!
> Since then, I’ve worked at several newspapers.  I started o ut at the bottom, writing obituaries and news briefs.  Then, I got a reg ular beat and wrote some features and investigative reports.  I’ve even written t he occasional editorial.
> What next?  You never know in the newspaper business, but I’m shooting for a Pulitzer!

Our story begins with me saying, “I have always wanted to be a news reporter.” A “news reporter” is a person whose job is to research and  describe things that are going on the in the world for a newspaper, a mag azine, perhaps a television news program or a radio news program, and of course now adays, for a news website.  This is not a true story, I should point out .  I did actually work as a news

 reporter when I was in college very briefly, and I was the editor of my high school newspaper, but that doesn’t really count as being a real  news reporter.  But I did consider in college; I decided against it.

“When I was about 10 years old,” according to the story, “ I would write my own news stories and publish them in my own newspaper.”  “To publish” means to print and distribute something for other people to re ad.  “In reality, the newspaper was just a piece of paper on which I’d written my stories and drew my pictures, but it was my first taste of the power of the press.”  Wh en we talk about your “first taste of (something)” we mean your first experience with  something, the first time that you have done something.  I had my first taste of the power of the press. The word “press” here is used the same as what we would n ow call the “media.” Newspapers, magazines, TV and radio stations, and websites  that report on the news would all be part of the press.  “Press” has other m eanings, however.  For those, take a look at our Learning Guide for this episod e.

My story continues: “When I got to college, I worked on t he university newspaper and started out as a copy editor, editing stories and wri ting headlines.”  A “copy editor” on a newspaper is the person whose job is to revi ew what other people have written, correct what they’ve written, maybe improve  it by making small changes.  “Copy” is another word for text, something that  you write.  We used to talk about newspapers having good copy, meaning interestin g stories.

I continue by saying that as a copy editor, I edited storie s and wrote headlines. “To edit” means to review, to correct, to improve.  Hence , “copy editor” is someone who reviews, corrects, and improves other people’s co py – other people’s writing.  “Headlines” are the title of the n ews articles, usually printed in a larger font – in a bigger size.  I continue: “Then, I began to cover news events.” “To cover,” when we’re talking about news, means to resea rch, investigate, and describe something – one particular topic.  Some newspap ers have certain reporters who always cover the economic news or who always c over the sports news.  You might watch a TV newscast and ask your friend ab out a story; he may say, “Oh, the newscast I watched didn’t cover that story, ” they didn’t describe it, didn’t talk about it.  A “newscast,” I should  add, is just a news broadcast – a news show.

So, I began to cover news events, getting my first bylines.  A “byline” (byline) is the line in the newspaper that says who wrote the story: “This was written by John Smith; this was written by Carl Bernstein.”  That’s a byline; it’s a little line below the headline that tells you who wrote this story.  Often, news stories have several reporters working on it; sometimes at the end of the news story it will say, “The following people also contributed,” or helped wr ite this story.

 “I can’t tell you how excited I was to see my name in prin t for the first time!” I say. “To be in print” means to be published, something that  is in a published document, such as a newspaper, a magazine, a book – things that other people can look at.  We call that being in print.  “Print,” h owever, has other meanings in English.  You know where to find those, in our Learni ng Guide.

I continue by saying that since then (since I was in college) , I’ve worked at several newspapers.  I started out at the bottom (meanin g in the lowest position of the newspaper), writing obituaries and news briefs.   When you go to work for a newspaper, the reporters with the least amount of expe rience, typically the youngest ones – the ones that just started working there,  are given the job of writing obituaries of famous people – even before the y die!  The newspaper starts preparing the obituary because, of course, when a person dies you want to report it in the next edition – the next day, typically, of a daily newspaper, and so you need to have that information prepared.  So for e xample, when a famous actor or politician dies, the newspaper already has in i ts files – it already has written – the basic obituary.  They may add a few things,  change a few things to make sure it is up to date.  “Obituaries” are descriptio ns of people who have died; sometimes we call them “obits” (obit).  An obit is the same as an obituary.  A “news briefs” is a very short, usually one paragraph article  about something. Sometimes in newspapers they want to report news that isn ’t necessarily that important, so they put little one paragraph descriptio ns of these news items inside the newspapers somewhere, and that’s what a new s brief is.  “To be brief” means to be short, so a news brief is a short – very short n ews article.  That’s what a, again, new reporter would start working on in  a newspaper.

“Then,” I say, “I got a regular beat.”  A “beat” is ei ther a general topic that you are always assigned to.  So, I mentioned earlier about thos e who write for the sports section, well, some reporters will always write about bas eball, some reporters will always write about football, others about tennis, and so  forth, depending on how big the newspaper is.  A “beat” can also refer to a ge ographic area.  In a city like Los Angeles, there might be one person that covers the n ews on the West Side – on the west part of the city, someone else who covers the downtown news, someone else who covers the San Fernando Valley, and so f orth.  These would all be beats.

I say that I also wrote some features and investigative rep orts.  A “feature” is short for a feature article; it’s a main story, usually a longer story about some news topic or about some person.  I say also that I’ve writ ten investigative reports.  “Investigative reports” are those that requir e usually a lot of research, sometimes months of research, often related to somethin g that is secret,

 something perhaps that the government is doing.  Usually only the more experienced news reporters work on investigative pieces, or stories.  I say also I’ve even written the occasional editorial.  An “editori al” is an opinion piece; it’s an article in the newspaper that gives your opinion.  It’s n ot focused on giving just the facts.  We hope that most newspapers give us, in the r egular news section, the facts and interpretation, not opinion.  That doesn ’t always happen, however. Notice here I say “the occasional,” meaning not very often,  every once in a while. I visit the occasional beach here in Southern California ; that means I go to a few beaches, but not very many and not that often.

Finally I say, “What next?  You never know in the newspap er business, but I’m shooting for a Pulitzer!”  “To shoot for (something)” i s a phrasal verb meaning to try to do, to try to get, to try to have something tha t is difficult but not impossible. “Denise is studying all time because she’s shooting for a hi gh score in her medical entrance exam.”  She wants to become a doctor, so she’s shooting for – she’s aiming at – her goal is to get this high score.  I  say that I’m aiming, or shooting for a Pulitzer Prize.  The Pulitzer Prize is the award given to news reporting in the United States for those that have ver y the best news reporters – the very best stories.  These are usually newspapers, at lea st they have been traditionally.  The best stories are given prizes in diff erent categories; so it may be the best sports story, it may be the best investigative st ory, and so forth. Typically, these awards are won by the large newspapers such  as the Wall Street Journal , the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , the Boston Globe , the Chicago Tribune , the San Francisco Chronicle , even the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch .  The Pulitzer is the most prestigious, most sought-afte r, we could say, award in journalism.  It’s like winning an Oscar if you’r e a movie actor.  I’m not sure what the best award would be for a podcaster; I’l l have to look into that!

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal spe ed.

[start of story]

I have always wanted to be a news reporter.  When I was about 10 years old, I would write my own news stories and publish them in my o wn newspaper.  In reality, the newspaper was just a piece of paper on which  I’d written my stories and drew my pictures, but it was my first taste of the pow er of the press.

When I got to college, I worked on the university newspa per and started out as a copy editor, editing stories and writing headlines.  Th en, I began to cover news events, getting my first bylines.  I can’t tell you how excit ed I was to see my name in print for the first time!

 Since then, I’ve worked at several newspapers.  I started o ut at the bottom, writing obituaries and news briefs.  Then, I got a reg ular beat and wrote some features and investigative reports.  I’ve even written t he occasional editorial.

What next?  You never know in the newspaper business, but I’m shooting for a Pulitzer!

# Renting a Movie

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 42: Renting a Movie.

This episode is called “Renting a Movie.”  It is a dialog ue between Brenda and Jang, talking about renting movies to watch at home.  Le t’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Brenda:  I have to return these movies in the drop box  today or I’ll have late fees. Can I get you anything while I’m out?

Jang:  Are you still renting movies from the video store?   I use a service that delivers the movies to my mailbox.  There are never any la te fees.

Brenda:  I’ve thought about subscribing to one of those services, but I think I would really miss browsing at the video store.  I like checki ng out the new releases and staff picks, and you never know what you’ll fin d to buy in the bargain bins.

Jang:  Renting movies online is so much quicker and easier.   I can browse the titles quickly, read the descriptions, read reviews, and some times even watch a trailer.  Then, all I need to do is put the movie in my queue, and as soon as I mail one movie back, they send me another one.  It’s that simpl e.

Brenda:  It does sound easy, but not everything that’s ea sy is better.  Some of us like to take our time to make our selections.

Jang:  Whatever.  If you want to spend your time looking  for movies rather than watching them, that’s your prerogative.

 Brenda:  Are you really going to let me off so easily?  I thought I was in for another one of your lectures.

Jang:  You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins when Brenda says, “I have to return these movies in the drop box today or I’ll have late fees.”  A “drop box” ( two words) is a large box – a large square container that has an opening were you can  put things into it, usually to return something to a store; it could also be  a public library.  Most libraries, as well as video rental stores, have boxes that  you can put the movie into and you don’t have to go in and talk to anyone.  You just return the movie by putting it into the drop box.  There’s another verb “ to drop off,” a two-word phrasal verb, which means to leave something for someone else.  So, you can drop off your movies in a drop box when you’re finished w atching them.  Brenda says she needs to return the movies or she’ll have late fees.   A “late fee” is an amount of money that you pay as a penalty for bringing something back late.  So if you rent a movie, and you return it three days late , you’ll probably have to pay a late fee: maybe 5 dollars maybe 10 dollars, it depend s on the store.  For the libraries, you may have to pay a quarter, you may have to p ay a dollar; again, it depends on the library.  But, those are late fees; they could also be called a “fine” or a “penalty.”

Brenda then asks Jang, “Can I get you anything while I’m  out?”  Jang says, “Are you still renting movies from the video store?”  “To rent ,” as you probably know, means to pay to use something for a short period of tim e.  You can rent a car; you can rent a house; you can rent a movie.  I read somewh ere that in some places you can also rent a dog or a cat.  I’m not sure why anyone would do that. But if you want to, this is America, you can do whatever you want, they say. Anyway, Jang asks Brenda, “Are you still renting movies from the video store?” The “video store” is the place that you rent, nowadays, DV Ds.  I guess in some video stores, you can still rent the old VHS cassette tapes .  Jang says, “I use a service that delivers the movies to my mailbox,” meaning the movies are mailed to his house or apartment.  “There are never any late f ees.”

Brenda says, “I’ve thought about subscribing to one of tho se services, but I think I would really miss browsing at the video store.”  “To sub scribe” means to pay for a service each month.  Usually you pay a little bit every we ek or every month to continue having a certain service.  If you have satellite o r cable television, you have to subscribe.  You have to pay a monthly fee in orde r to get that service; it could be anywhere from 25 to 125 dollars.  Brenda says th at she doesn’t want to

 subscribe to one of these services because she thinks she would miss browsing. “To browse” (browse) means to looks slowly at what is availa ble in a store, to look and see if there’s anything new or interesting.  I t’s when you are not necessarily looking for one specific thing, but you just sort of want to see what is available.  Brenda says, “I like checking out the new relea ses and staff picks, and you never know what you’re going to find to buy in the bargain bins.”  She says she likes checking out.  “To check out” is a two-word phrasal  verb meaning to look at something, to see something.  Sometimes this expre ssion is used between people.  If you say, “The man was checking out the  woman walking down the street,” that means that he was looking at he r in some sort of romantic or perhaps sexual way.  But here, in general “to check out ” just means to find out, to investigate, to look at something in this case.  “New releases” are things that have just been published.  When a DVD movie is first rele ased, meaning you can first get it – first made available, that would be cal led a new release.  “Staff picks” are when the people who work at the video store recomm end movies to other people.  So there’s usually a separate section, and belo w are the names of someone who works at the store who recommends movies.  the idea being that someone who works at the video store may know a lot about  movies; that isn’t always true.  Brenda says she likes to check out the new rele ases and staff picks, “and you never know what you’ll find to buy in the bargain bins.”  A “bin” is a large box.  A “bargain” is something that is cheap, so mething has a low price or a good price for what it is worth.  A “bargain bin,” then, is a big box that has things in it that are cheap – cheap to buy.  In a video store, the bargain bin would be movies – DVDs that the store was selling, not just re nting.

Jang says that renting movies online is so much quicker and e asier.  He says, “I can browse the titles quickly, read the descriptions, read r eviews, and sometimes even watch a trailer.”  A “review,” in this case, is a wri tten opinion that somebody has about the movie.  The word “review” has several diffe rent meanings however; take a look at our Learning Guide for additi onal explanations.  A “trailer” is a short video advertisement for the movie.  It’s like a movie commercial that tells you a little bit about the movie and what it is a bout.  Jang says, “Then, all I need to do is put the movie in my queue, and as soon as I  mail one movie back, they send me another one.  It’s that simple.”  A “queue ” (queue) is a list of things, in a particular order, that are being waited for – t hings that you are waiting for. Or, if you are waiting for something yourself in a lin e, that could also be called a queue.  That use of the word is a little more common in British English; here we would just say, “I was waiting in line.”  I was standing in line.  “Queue,” in this dialogue, means the list of movies that you want to rent .  So if you rent movies online, you can pick the movies you want, and then they wi ll send them to you when you send a movie that you already rented back.  What happens is they mail you, usually, two or three movies at a time, and you can o nly have two or three

 movies rented at one time.  You have to return – that is, mail your DVD back to the company, and they will mail you a new movie, the ne xt movie on your queue.

Brenda says, “It does sound easy, but not everything that’s e asy is better.  Some of us like to take our time to make our selections.”  “T o make your selection” is just another way of saying to select, to choose.  Jang says, “ Whatever.” “Whatever,” in this case, is used to show that you either don’t believe what a person is telling you or you don’t agree with what anot her person has said.  It’s an informal expression; it’s a negative expression.  You wouldn’t want to say it to anyone that was in authority over you, like your boss, cert ainly not to someone that you don’t know – unless you don’t like the person anyw ay, I’m not sure. “Whatever” can mean other things as well; once again, t he Learning Guide will give you more information about how to use this word.

Jang says, “If you want to spend your time looking for movie s rather than watching them, that’s your prerogative.”  A “prerogati ve” is your right, something that you are allowed to do.  Brenda says, “Are you reall y going to let me off so easily?  I thought I was in for another one of your l ectures.”  “To let (someone) off easily” means not to fight someone.  You could argue wi th them, you could fight with them but you decide, eh, it’s not worth your troub le.  You decide to let them off easily.  Brenda says that she thought she was going to get another one of Jang’s lectures.  A “lecture” is normally a speech that a pr ofessor would give to his students – a presentation.  But when you use it in an  informal sense, it’s almost always a negative description of someone who is tell ing you what you should do, as if they were your professor.  Teenagers migh t complain that their parents are always lecturing them; they’re always giving th em lessons, usually about the things that they’re doing wrong.  But of cou rse, teenagers do a lot of things wrong, so it’s hard to blame the parents!

Jang says, “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t ma ke it drink.”  This is an old expression.  It means that you can tell a person wh at to do, and give him or her opportunities to do it, but you can’t force some one to do something.  They have to want to do it.  So, you can lead a horse to w ater – you can bring a horse, the animal, to a bucket of water, say – but you can’t fo rce the horse to drink.  So, this is an old expression.  What Jang is saying is that he h as given Brenda the information she needs about renting online, if she doe sn’t want to use it then that’s her decision – that’s her problem.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Brenda:  I have to return these movies in the drop box  today or I’ll have late fees. Can I get you anything while I’m out?

Jang:  Are you still renting movies from the video store?   I use a service that delivers the movies to my mailbox.  There are never any la te fees.

Brenda:  I’ve thought about subscribing to one of those services, but I think I would really miss browsing at the video store.  I like checki ng out the new releases and staff picks, and you never know what you’ll fin d to buy in the bargain bins.

Jang:  Renting movies online is so much quicker and easier.   I can browse the titles quickly, read the descriptions, read reviews, and some times even watch a trailer.  Then, all I need to do is put the movie in my queue, and as soon as I mail one movie back, they send me another one.  It’s that simpl e.

Brenda:  It does sound easy, but not everything that’s ea sy is better.  Some of us like to take our time to make our selections.

Jang:  Whatever.  If you want to spend your time looking  for movies rather than watching them, that’s your prerogative.

Brenda:  Are you really going to let me off so easily?  I thought I was in for another one of your lectures.

Jang:  You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.

# Describing Different Smells

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 43: Describing Different Smells.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 543.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there today to download t he Learning Guide for this episode, that will help you improve your English eve n faster.

This episode is called “Describing Different Smells.”  It’ s a dialogue between Julia and Giles talking about the different words we use to d escribe how things smell in English.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Giles:  Do you really think we’ll be able to renovate th is place and turn it into a restaurant?

Julia:  It’s not so bad.  I know it smells a little sta le and musty in here, but all we need to do is air it out.

Giles:  Air it out?  This place needs a lot more than an airing out.  The kitchen smells putrid.  I wonder what died in there.

Julia:  There is a faint smell of something nasty in ther e, but I don’t think it permeates through the rest of the building, do you?

Giles:  No, but there are different nasty smells in ot her parts of the building.  Oh! There’s a really strong burnt, smoky smell in this corner.  Hold your breath!

Julia:  This is  a restaurant.  I’m sure a thorough cleaning will make  all the difference.

Giles:  That might be true for the kitchen, but what w ill you do in the dining room? An entire truckload of scented candles or bottles of perf ume couldn’t mask those foul smells.  This place just stinks, from top to bottom!

Julia:  All right, I’ll look for another building, bu t this place is cheap and within our budget.

 Giles:  Yes, but if I had to work here, I’d first have t o lose my sense of smell!

[end of dialogue]

Giles begins by saying to Julia, “Do you really think we’ll be able to renovate this place and turn it into a restaurant?”  “To renovate” means to improve a room or an entire building by usually rebuilding parts of it, e xpanding it, perhaps putting different decoration – different colors, that sort of t hing.  “To renovate” means to make new, in some ways, the room or the building.  Gil es wants to take a place, some place they own or are renting, and turn it into a  restaurant, meaning make it into a restaurant.  Maybe it was a store before, n ow it would be something different.

Julia says, “It’s not so bad.”  The place is not too bad is what she’s saying.  She says, “I know it smells a little stale and musty in here, b ut all we need to do is air it out.”  “Stale” is a way of describing a smell that i s not fresh, that is old; something that smells used could be described as stale.  “Mu sty” (musty) is something that smells like it’s slightly wet; it’s a very bad  smell, usually because there hasn’t been enough air circulation in a particula r area.  If you live in the northern part of the United States and your house has a  basement, sometimes in the basement it can get very moist, very damp, meaning th ere’s water there, and that can lead to a musty smell.  “To air (something) ou t” means to open windows or to do something to make the air move around the par ticular space so it dries out, smells better, gets rid of the bad smells.  You mi ght open a window, for example, to air something out.

Giles says, “Air it out?  This place needs a lot more than  an airing out.”  Notice he uses “airing out” as a noun, from the verb “to air (some thing) out.”  He says, “The kitchen smells putrid.”  “Putrid” (putrid) is the smell of something that is dead, something that is perhaps decaying, meaning that, for exa mple, it’s been sitting there for a long time and so it starts to come apart.  A human body, if it were left in a room – a dead body, that is – would start to decay.   It would start to change colors; it would start to smell bad.  Well, that bad sm ell we could describe as being putrid.  It doesn’t just mean it’s a dead body; there are other things that can smell putrid.  “Putrid” is perhaps one on the most nega tive words you can use to describe the way that something smells.  Giles says, “I wonde r what died in there.”  He’s joking; he doesn’t mean something actually is dead in there – although it’s possible!

Julia says, “There is a faint smell of something nasty in t here, but I don’t think it permeates through the rest of the building, do you?”  A “faint (faint) smell” is a

 very slight, very small – so small you can almost not notice i t.  “Faint” has a lot of different meanings in English in addition to this one.   Take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.  “Nasty” (nasty) is somet hing that is very unpleasant; we might even say it’s disgusting or it’s gross .  It’s a very negative way to describe something.  You could say, “It was a nasty fi ght.”  The two people were fighting, they were yelling at each other , they were shouting, using bad language.  That would be a nasty fight.  Here, “n asty” means that the smell is very bad.  Julia says there’s a faint smell something nasty in  there, but she doesn’t think it permeates through the rest of the buil ding.  “To permeate” (permeate) means to be present in every part of somethin g – in every part of, in this case, the building.  If a nasty smell permeates the b uilding, we mean you can smell it everywhere in the building.

Giles says that he doesn’t think the nasty smell permeates through the rest of the building, but there are different nasty smells in othe r parts of the building.  He then says, “Oh!  There’s a really strong burnt, smoky smell i n this corner.  Hold your breath!”  A “burnt (burnt) smell” would be someth ing that smells after it has been damaged by fire.  “Smoky,” similarly, means that some thing has been burning, or something has been producing smoke, and the  smoke is now the smell that you get when you go close to that object.  So if there’s a fire in the room, and there was a wooden chair, after the fire wh atever is left of the chair might have a burnt, smoky smell.  Giles says to Julia, “Hold  your breath!”  “To hold your breath” means not to breathe, usually because yo u don’t want to smell something.  You want to avoid a bad smell, hold your b reath.  It means not to breathe.

Julia says, “This is  a restaurant.  I’m sure a thorough cleaning will make all the difference.”  So I guess they’re in a building that had  a restaurant, but it’s an old one and it needs cleaning up.  Giles says, “That might b e true for the kitchen, but what will you do in the dining room (the place where people eat, or dine)?  An entire truckload of scented candles or bottles of perfume  couldn’t mask those foul smells.  This place just stinks, from top to bottom!”  Gil es says that an entire truckload of scented candles or bottles of perfume couldn’t  mask those fouls smells.  A “truckload,” here, would be the amount that you could put into a truck; more generally, it just means a large amount of somethi ng.  So he’s saying that even if we had a large number of scented candles – “scente d” means with a pleasant smell.  So you buy a candle, and you light it, a nd it gives off a pleasant smell.  That would be a scented candle.  I personally don ’t like scented candles, because I don’t think the smell is very pleasant at all usu ally.  Giles also mentions bottles of perfume.  “Perfume” is a liquid wi th a strong, pleasant smell. It’s used primarily by women.  When men use perfume, the y don’t call it perfume, they typically call it “cologne,” just so they don’t seem li ke they’re women I guess.

 I don’t know; it’s all perfume basically!  “To mask” (mask)  means to cover something, to make it difficult or impossible to see or smell or hear something.  In this case, make it difficult to smell something.  “Foul” (foul) is like the word “putrid,” something that is very unpleasant, something th at is very bad.  “Foul,” however, has some other meanings; take a look at the Lea rning Guide for those.

So going back, Giles says, “An entire truckload of scented ca ndles or bottles of perfume couldn’t mask those foul smells.  This place just st inks, from top to bottom!”  “To stink” means to have a very bad smell.  Yo u would never want to say to your boss or to your girlfriend, “Boy, you really stin k!”  That is not a nice thing to say.  More generally, “stink” means to be very bad  at something.  So we could say, “Ah, that baseball player stinks.”  “David Beckham stinks,” for example.  I’m not saying he actually stinks; I don’t watch soccer so I don’t really know!  But when Giles says, “This place just stinks,” he mea ns it literally stinks; it smells “from top to bottom,” meaning the entire build ing – the entire room.

Julia says, “All right, I’ll look for another building, but this place is cheap and within our budget,” meaning we can afford it; we ha ve enough money for what we planned.  Giles says, “Yes, but if I had to work here, I ’d first have to lose my sense of smell!”  Your sense of smell is your ability to smel l.  We talk about the five senses: smell, see, hear, taste, and touch.  And then  of course, the sixth sense, which is the ability to see dead people – if you sa w the movie, you know what I’m talking about!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Giles:  Do you really think we’ll be able to renovate th is place and turn it into a restaurant?

Julia:  It’s not so bad.  I know it smells a little sta le and musty in here, but all we need to do is air it out.

Giles:  Air it out?  This place needs a lot more than an airing out.  The kitchen smells putrid.  I wonder what died in there.

Julia:  There is a faint smell of something nasty in ther e, but I don’t think it permeates through the rest of the building, do you?

Giles:  No, but there are different nasty smells in ot her parts of the building.  Oh! There’s a really strong burnt, smoky smell in this corner.  Hold your breath!

 Julia:  This is  a restaurant.  I’m sure a thorough cleaning will make  all the difference.

Giles:  That might be true for the kitchen, but what w ill you do in the dining room? An entire truckload of scented candles or bottles of perf ume couldn’t mask those foul smells.  This place just stinks, from top to bottom!

Julia:  All right, I’ll look for another building, bu t this place is cheap and within our budget.

Giles:  Yes, but if I had to work here, I’d first have t o lose my sense of smell!

There was nothing stale about this dialogue, because it was written by Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Working from a Home Office

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 44: Working from a Home Office.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 544.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com, you’ll be glad you did.   There you can download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you i mprove your English much faster.  You can also take a look at our ESL Podcast Stor e, which has additional courses in business and daily English.

This episode is called “Working from a Home Office.”  It’ s a dialogue between Adrina and Victor, using vocabulary associated with having an office at home. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Adrina:  So this is your new home office.  It’s nice.

Victor:  It’s functional, and I like it.  When my compan y decided to lower its overhead by decentralizing, it gave employees the option to work from home. When I heard that, I didn’t think twice about making t he change.

Adrina:  I’m not surprised.  Lots of people would kill to work from home.  Did you have to get dedicated phone and fax lines?

Victor:  No, I already have a company cell phone, and I mainly use email to communicate with the office.

Adrina:  I assume you get to set your own schedule.  Do you  find it hard to concentrate on your work?  I know I’d be distracted all the time if I had a home office.

Victor:  It’s true that there are a lot more distractio ns at home, but I try to block them out.  For me, it’s not getting down to work that ’s a problem, it’s getting myself to stop thinking about work all the time!  That’s one of the drawbacks of working where you live.  I’m more productive, but I’m a lso more work-centered.

 Adrina:  I can see that, though I’d still take working from home over working at the office any day.

Victor:  I thought you had a home office for your real estate business.

Adrina:  I do, but it’s not very conducive to getting an y work done.

Victor:  Why’s that?

Adrina:  My home office doubles as the guestroom and the kids’ playroom!

[end of dialogue]

Our conversation begins with Adrina saying to Victor, “So this is your new home office.  It’s nice.”  Victor says, “It’s functional, and I like it.”  “To be functional” means to work properly; something that meets your needs, so mething that does what it’s supposed to do.  It’s usually used to describe so mething that works well but isn’t necessarily beautiful.  Victor says, “When my compa ny decided to lower its overhead by decentralizing, it gave employees the opt ion to work from home.” “Overhead” (one word) is the amount of money a company h as to spend no matter how many products or services it sells.  It’s money tha t you have to spend, even if you only sell a little bit.  That would b e things like the rent for an office, the price of all of the equipment and materia ls in an office; these are part of a company’s overhead.  “Overhead” has a couple of diffe rent meanings however.  To find out more about those you have to go t o the Learning Guide.

So Victor says that his company decided to lower its overhead .  It wanted to reduce, or cut, its costs so it decided to decentralize.  “T o decentralize” means to spread things out so they’re not all concentrated, or cent ered, in one place.  We often add the suffix “ize” after a word to make it into  a verb: centralize; decentralize.  “To centralize,” of course, is the opposite,  to bring everything into one place.  Well, the company is decentralizing; it’s tell ing the employees they can work at home.  Victor says, “When I heard that, I did n’t think twice about making the change.”  “To think twice” means to hesitate i n making a decision; you’re thinking about it a lot.  But Victor didn’t thi nk about it at all; he knew this was a good choice for him – he didn’t think twice: “Whe n I saw the woman who later became my wife, as soon as I saw her I didn’t thi nk twice.  I said, ‘You will be my love.’”  Well, I didn’t say that to her of course,  she would have never come close to me if I had!

Adrina says, “I’m not surprised.  Lots of people would ki ll to work from home.” When we say someone “would kill to do (something)” we m ean the person really

 wants to do that thing or have that thing: “I would ki ll to have tickets to the World Series next year.”  I would do a lot, because I really wa nt it.  So if you have tickets to the World Series next year, please send me an email.  Of course, I won’t actually kill anyone to get my tickets!

Adrina says that a lot of people would kill to work from  home.  “Did you have to get dedicated phone and fax lines?” she asks.  “Dedicated,”  here, means used for only one thing, for one purpose.  To have a dedicat ed phone line means that it’s a phone you have just for your business uses, you don’t share your personal phone for that reason.  Adrina is asking if Victor had to get dedicated phone and fax lines – telephone lines.  Victor says, “No, I already have a company cell phone, and I mainly use email to communicate with the o ffice.”  So he uses his cell phone as his company phone.

Adrina says, “I assume you get to set your own schedule.”  “T o set your own schedule” means to decide when you are going to do certai n things; you are in control of your schedule.  You can decide you’re going t o start work at 9:00 this morning, or at 10:00, or at 6:00 – you set your own sch edule.  Adrina says, “Do you find it hard to concentrate on your work?”  “To concen trate on (something)” means to focus on something, to put your attention on a particular thing.  Adrina says, “I know I’d be distracted all the time if I had a h ome office.”  “To be distracted” means not to be able to pay attention to som ething, because you’re looking at something else or you’re listening to somethin g else.  If you’re talking to someone else and they’re distracted, they might be loo king out the window, they might be looking at their cell phone; they’re not really listening to you.

Adrina says, “I know I’d be distracted all the time if I had a home office,” a place where you can work in your home.  Victor says, “It’s true  that there are a lot more distractions at home, but I try to block them out.”  “To block (something) out” is a phrasal verb meaning to ignore something, not to pay at tention to something, especially noise – things you can hear.  When I go to Star bucks and there is somebody talking next to me and I’m trying to read, I bl ock them out by listening to music.  So, Victor tries to block out the distractions.  “For me, it’s not getting down to work that’s a problem (meaning it’s not getti ng started and actually working), it’s getting myself to stop thinking about work all the time!”  This is a problem with working at home, you always feel like you’re  at work.  “That’s one of the drawbacks,” he says, “of working where you live.”  A “d rawback” (one word) is a disadvantage, a negative aspect of doing something.  One drawback of living in Los Angeles is that there’s always traffic on the freew ays.  Another drawback is the pollution.  Another drawback could be the people  here; other than that, it’s a great place to live!

 Victor says, “I’m more productive, but I’m also more work-ce ntered.”  “To be productive” means to be able to get a lot of work done in a short period of time, to produce a lot of good results.  Victor says, “I’m more pro ductive, but I’m also more work-centered.”  “Work-centered” means focused on your  work.  We can use this construction – this form with many different kinds  of nouns.  You could say that she’s very “family-centered,” she’s focused on her fa mily.  That’s what’s most important to her, that’s where she spends most of h er time.  You could be “language learning-centered,” you always spend your time trying to improve your language skills, and so forth.

Adrina says, “I can see that (I can understand that), thou gh I’d still take working from home over working at the office any day.”  When we  say we “can take (something) over (something else)” we mean we would p refer that first thing over that second thing.  So for example: “Francesca is a veget arian, so she’ll always take a vegetable dish over a steak.”  She’ll prefer vegeta bles instead of the steak.

Victor says, “I thought you had a home office for your rea l estate business.” “Real estate” is selling homes or buildings.  Adrina says, “I do, but it’s not very conducive to getting any work done.”  Something that is “ conducive to (something)” is helpful, useful, something that helps you  do something else.  A lot of noise is not conducive to studying or to reading, at l east for me.  So, Victor asks Adrina why her home office is not very conducive to get ting any work done. She says, “My home office doubles as the guestroom and the kids’ playroom!” When we say something “doubles as” something else, we mea n that it is used for more than one thing.  The word “double” actually has se veral meanings in English.  You know where you can find those, in the Lea rning Guide.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Adrina:  So this is your new home office.  It’s nice.

Victor:  It’s functional, and I like it.  When my compan y decided to lower its overhead by decentralizing, it gave employees the option to work from home. When I heard that, I didn’t think twice about making t he change.

Adrina:  I’m not surprised.  Lots of people would kill to work from home.  Did you have to get dedicated phone and fax lines?

 Victor:  No, I already have a company cell phone, and I mainly use email to communicate with the office.

Adrina:  I assume you get to set your own schedule.  Do you  find it hard to concentrate on your work?  I know I’d be distracted all the time if I had a home office.

Victor:  It’s true that there are a lot more distractio ns at home, but I try to block them out.  For me, it’s not getting down to work that ’s a problem, it’s getting myself to stop thinking about work all the time!  That’s one of the drawbacks of working where you live.  I’m more productive, but I’m a lso more work-centered.

Victor:  I thought you had a home office for your real estate business.

Adrina:  I do, but it’s not very conducive to getting an y work done.

Victor:  Why’s that?

Adrina:  My home office doubles as the guestroom and the kids’ playroom!

# Getting Around Without a Car

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 45: Getting Around Without a Car.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 545.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com, but you probably already know th at.  You probably know that you can go there to download a Learning Guid e for this episode to help you improve your English even faster.  You might know tha t the Learning Guide contains all of the vocabulary, definitions, sample sentence s, additional definitions, comprehension questions, cultural notes, and a complete transcript of this episode.

What you probably don’t know is that this episode is a di alogue between Caitland and Bruno, talking about different ways that you can tra nsport yourself from one place to another without having a car.  Let’s get start ed.

[start of dialogue]

Caitland:  How are you planning on getting to school a nd to your job without a car?

Bruno:  I’ve got it covered.  I have my skateboard.

Caitland:  Your skateboard won’t be any use on those d irt roads.

Bruno:  No big thing.  I’ll just take my bike.

Caitland:  Your bike was stolen, along with your roller blades, remember?

Bruno:  Oh, yeah.  Maybe I’ll save up and buy a Segwa y.

Caitland:  Those things are really expensive.  What’ll yo u do in the meantime?

Bruno:  Maybe I’ll take the bus.  Worst case scenario, I give myself more time and I walk.  Why are you so interested in how I’m going to commute?  Fess up.

Caitland:  I care about your well-being, that’s all.

 Bruno:  Oh, yeah?  I don’t buy it.  There’s got to be  an ulterior motive.

Caitland:  Well, I do have an old scooter that would b e just what you need to get back and forth from school and work.  It uses very little g as and I’ll let you have it for next to nothing.

Bruno:  I knew it.  You’re trying to pawn off that ol d scooter on me.  Forget it!

Caitland:  I’m just looking out for your best interest,  that’s all.

Bruno:  Isn’t that what all con artists say?

Caitland begins the dialogue by saying to Bruno, “How are you planning on getting to school (“how are you going to get to school, ” she could say) and to your job without a car?”  Bruno says, “I’ve got it covered .”  When we say “we have (something) covered,” or “we have got it covered,” we  mean to say that we have the situation under control.  You know what you’re  going to do to handle, or deal with, this situation or this problem.  So Bruno sa ys, “I’ve got it covered,” I know what I’m going to do.  He says, “I have my skateboard. ”  “Skateboards” are flat, rectangular boards, usually with rounded edges and  they have four small wheels on them, and you can put your foot on the skatebo ard and use your other foot to push yourself, and you then use the wheels of the  skateboard to go faster than you could by walking.  Skateboards have been popular among teenagers for many years.  They weren’t popular when I was a teenager;  but then again, they had not yet invented the wheel!

So, Bruno says that he’s going to take his skateboard.  Cai tland says, “Your skateboard won’t be any use on those dirt roads.”  When we say “it won’t be any use,” we mean that it will not be able to be used.  “Dirt roads” are also called “unpaved roads.”  A “paved road” is a road that has cemen t or asphalt, something hard that a car can easily drive on.  “Unpaved” would be a road that is just the ground – just the earth, with nothing on top  of it.

Caitland says that your skateboard won’t be any use on those  dirt roads, and Bruno says, “No big thing.”  “No big thing” is an infor mal way of saying it’s not important, it’s not something to be worried about.  We might also say “it’s no big deal.”  It’s no big thing – it’s no big deal.  “I’ll just take my bike (my bicycle),” which of course is a vehicle with two wheels and a seat, a nd you move the wheels around using something called “pedals,” which go o n your feet.  Your feet push the pedals, move them up and down to make the whee ls move.

 Caitland says, “Your bike was stolen, along with your rol lerblades, remember?” “Rollerblades” are special shoes that have a single line  of wheels on the bottom; they’re similar to roller skates.  “Roller skates” are shoe s that have four wheels on them, just like a skateboard, one in each corner.  “Rollerblades” have just a single row of small wheels.  Rollerblading is still pop ular especially here in California.  If you go over to Venice Beach or the San ta Monica Beach you can see people rollerblading.  I tried rollerblading once  or twice, but was not very good at it.

Bruno says, “Oh, yeah.  Maybe I’ll save up (maybe I’ll save my money) and buy a Segway.”  A “Segway” (Segway) is an electric machine with  two wheels and a small, flat area that you stand on.  It sort of looks like  the old Roman chariots, except there aren’t any horses in front.  “Chariots” wer e vehicles that they used with horses to move around in.  They used to have chariot races in the Roman Empire – the ancient Roman Empire.  Well, Segways are sort of like chariots. They’re two wheels and a flat space to stand, and then yo u have something that comes up vertically that you can hold onto and steer the S egway.  You can think of it as a little car, with just two wheels, in some w ays.  But it’s only used for moving along the sidewalk, it’s not fast enough to go on  the street; it’s not like a motorcycle, for example.

Caitland says, “Those things (meaning Segways) are really (or very) expensive. What’ll you do in the meantime (what will you do in t he meantime)?”  “In the meantime” means while you’re waiting for something el se to happen, or until something else happens.  I’m sitting at a cafe waiting f or my friend, it’s 2:30 in the afternoon, my friend is arriving at 3:00.  So in the m eantime, I’m going to read the newspaper.

Bruno says, “Maybe I’ll take the bus.  Worst case scenario, I  give myself more time and I walk.”  “Worst case scenario” means in the wor st possible situation; the worst situation that could happen.  A “scenario” is a  likely event, a certain situation that will take place in the future.  “Worst ca se” means the worst possible situation.  Bruno says, “Why are you so interested in how I ’m going to commute?” “To commute” is to travel between your home and where yo u work – unless you work at home, of course.  Bruno says, “Fess up.”  “Fess up” i s short for confess. “To confess” means to tell the truth, or tell something that perhaps you did wrong that you want to keep a secret.  If the police arrest you  after you robbed a bank – after you stole money from a bank, they may ask you to confe ss, meaning tell them what happened.  Of course if you do, you’re gonna  go to jail.  If you don’t, you’ll probably go the jail, too.  So, depends on the situation.  The last time I robbed a bank, oh, probably 10 years ago, I decided not to fess up, and for my

 punishment they made me teach at the university.  So, you  have to be careful about these things!

Where were we?  “To fess up” means to, again, to confe ss.  So, Bruno knows that Caitland is asking these questions for some reason, he’s trying to find out why.  Caitland says, “I care about your well-being, that’ s all.”  Your “well-being” is your physical, mental, and emotional health; all of tho se things combined.  Bruno says, “Oh, yeah?  I don’t buy it (meaning I don’t believe  it).  There’s got to be an ulterior motive.”  An “ulterior motive” is a secret reaso n for wanting to do something.  You’re pretending like you’re doing it for  one reason, but you’re really doing it for another reason.  So, you see a beautiful woman at the café, and you’re unmarried, and you walk over there, and you ask her  what book she’s reading.  Well, you really don’t care what book she’s r eading, you’re just looking for an excuse to talk to her; you have an ulterior motive  for asking the question.

Caitland says, “Well, I do have an old scooter that would  be just what you need to get back and forth from school and work.”  A “scooter ” is sort of like a very small motorcycle.  It can also be a flat, rectangular boa rd, kind of like a skateboard, but it has either an engine on it – a very sm all motorcycle-like engine, or some scooters are basically just like skateboards e xcept they have a stick that comes up vertically that you can hold onto to steer  the scooter.  So, Caitland has a scooter she wants to sell to Bruno that he  can use to go back and forth to school and work.  This scooter has a motor on it , because Caitland says, “It uses very little gas and I’ll let you have it for ne xt to nothing,” meaning I’ll sell it to you at a low price – next to nothing.

Bruno says, “I knew it.  You’re trying to pawn off that old scooter on me.  Forget it!”  “To pawn (pawn) off (something)” is a phrasal ver b meaning to get rid of something by selling it, especially if it isn’t worth very m uch money.  You just are trying to get rid of it, and you try to get the best p rice you can.  The word “pawn” has a couple of other meanings in English as well, very d ifferent meanings.  Find those in the Learning Guide for this episode.

Caitland says, “I’m just looking out for your best interest , that’s all.”  To look out for (someone’s) best interest” means that you are trying to do what is best for the other person; you’re trying to help the other person.  Bruno says, “Isn’t that what all con artists say?”  A “con (con) artist” is a person wh o makes money by tricking other people – by fooling other people, making them t hink they are doing something to help them, when actually they are basically st ealing their money.  A “con” is when someone tricks you out of your money.  It stand s for “confidence.” You get the person’s confidence – you get them to trust yo u, and then you steal their money.  That’s basically what a con artist does.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Caitland:  How are you planning on getting to school a nd to your job without a car?

Bruno:  I’ve got it covered.  I have my skateboard.

Caitland:  Your skateboard won’t be any use on those d irt roads.

Bruno:  No big thing.  I’ll just take my bike.

Caitland:  Your bike was stolen, along with your roller blades, remember?

Bruno:  Oh, yeah.  Maybe I’ll save up and buy a Segwa y.

Caitland:  Those things are really expensive.  What’ll yo u do in the meantime?

Bruno:  Maybe I’ll take the bus.  Worst case scenario, I give myself more time and I walk.  Why are you so interested in how I’m going to commute?  Fess up.

Caitland:  I care about your well-being, that’s all.

Bruno:  Oh, yeah?  I don’t buy it.  There’s got to be  an ulterior motive.

Caitland:  Well, I do have an old scooter that would b e just what you need to get back and forth from school and work.  It uses very little g as and I’ll let you have it for next to nothing.

Bruno:  I knew it.  You’re trying to pawn off that ol d scooter on me.  Forget it!

Caitland:  I’m just looking out for your best interest,  that’s all.

Bruno:  Isn’t that what all con artists say?

# Having an Open House

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 46: Having an Open House.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 546.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Having an Open House.”  It’s a di alogue between Kyoko and Ernie; they’re going to be using some vocabulary th at is common when we talk about open houses, when you sell your house.  We’ll find out more about that in a minute.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Kyoko:  We’re not supposed to be here.  I think we shoul d leave and let our real estate agent hold the open house without us looking over  her shoulder.

Ernie:  We’re not looking over her shoulder.  I just wa nt to sit in this car to see how many people go in and out.

Kyoko:  You know, there’ll be a lot of lookie-loos.  And  plus, there’ll be a sign-in sheet, so we’ll be able to see afterwards how many peopl e stopped in.

Ernie:  Hey, someone’s coming in now.

Kyoko:  That’s the stager.  She’s making some last-minute changes.

Ernie:  She really doesn’t need to do anything else.  W e did everything our agent told us to do.  We made cosmetic repairs, painted, and de-cluttered.  What more could they ask for?

 Kyoko:  She’s just doing some minor landscaping, putting so me plants along the front path and around the front door.  Let’s get out  of here before people start showing up.  I don’t want to seem like I’m spying on my o wn house.

Ernie:  What does it matter?  Hand me the fact sheet for our house.  I want to read it through again to make sure the agent didn’t miss anything.  Okay, the square footage on the house and the lot are correct, s he noted that our addition is permitted, and she mentioned the upgrades – good.  Where are you going?

Kyoko:  I’m not going to sit in this car for the next fou r hours.  Let’s go to visit our neighbors’ open houses.

Ernie:  Good idea.  We’ll see what our competition is and maybe we can steal some of their open house ideas!

[end of dialogue]

Kyoko begins this dialogue by saying to Ernie, “We’re not supposed to be here.” What she’s saying is that this is a place where they are not  permitted or that they should not be in.  “We’re not supposed to be here.  I think we should leave and let our real estate agent hold the open house without  us looking over her shoulder.”  A “real estate agent” refers to a person, t he agent, who sells houses and buildings – real estate.  So a real estate agent i s someone who sells and buys homes, buildings, and sometimes just the land.

An “open house” is an event where people can come into a  home that is for sale, walk through it, look at it, learn about it, ask questio ns of the real estate agent, the person who’s selling the home for the owners; in t he United States this is a very common custom.  To sell your house you have, usually on a  Sunday afternoon from one in the afternoon to perhaps four or two to five, you have people come to your house, you advertise your house for sale , people come and walk around it and look at it and can ask the agent ques tions.  Typically, however, the owners of the house are not at the open house.  The real estate agent is responsible for showing the house.  Some people  like to have open houses because it gets more people interested in their ho use, and perhaps someone will buy it from looking at it.  Some people d on’t like open houses because many times the people who go and look at the ho use are not really interested in buying it; they just want to see what the  house looks like.  So if you come to the United States in you’re in a large city, you can buy the Sunday newspaper, take a look at the open house listings, and sim ply go and take a look at some houses, pretending perhaps that you’re intereste d.  Many people go and look at other people’s houses if they’re going to be sel ling theirs to see how good

 the house is for the price.  It sometimes helps you figu re out what price you want to put on your house.  Most real estate agents know that  many of the people who come to the house are not really that interested in bu ying it; they just want to see. Sometimes even the neighbors come and look at a house th at is being sold in their neighborhood.

Kyoko says that she thinks that she and Ernie should leave.  S he says that they should let their real estate agent hold the open house  – “to hold an open house” means to have an open house – “without us looking over he r shoulder.”  “To look over (someone’s) shoulder” is an expression that means to wa tch another person’s work very closely, to pay careful attention to what  another person is doing, especially when that person doesn’t want you watchi ng them.  So you’re doing something at your desk in your office and your boss co mes over and looks at what you are doing and watches you work, you might s ay to him, “Why are you looking over my shoulder?”  He may, or she, may not actual ly be looking over your shoulder, that is looking down at your desk with thei r head above your shoulder.  It’s the expression that we use to mean to wat ch someone else working when they don’t really want you watching them w orking.

Ernie says, “We’re not looking over her shoulder.  I just want to sit in this car to see how many people go in and out.”  So they’re not i n the house; they’re sitting in their car outside of the house.  Kyoko says, “You know, t here’ll be a lot of lookie-loos.”  A “lookie-loo” is an informal expression for someone who likes to see what is happening, especially someone who doesn’t real ly need to see it.  So in this case, lookie-loos would be people, as I mentioned  earlier, who go to the open house and don’t want to buy the house, they just want to see the house. Kyoko says, “And plus (meaning in addition), there’ll be a sign-in sheet, so we will be able to see afterwards how many people stopped in.”  A “sign-in sheet” is a piece of paper where everyone who is participating or  attending a certain event puts his or her name, sometimes the address and the phon e number.  In open houses, real estate agents asks everyone who comes into the ho use to sign the sign-in sheet, mainly to get their name and telephone number and call them later to see if they’re interested in selling their house or interested in buying the house. It is also proof to the owners of the house that people  came and looked at the house.  The term “sign-in sheet” can be used for any eve nt, anything that you want people, when they first come to, to put down the ir name, sometimes their signature.  So Kyoko is telling Ernie that they don’t ne ed to sit there and watch everyone going into the house, they can just look at the si gn-in sheet later.

Ernie says, “Hey, someone’s coming in now.”  Someone is go ing into their house. Kyoko says, “That’s the stager.  She’s making some last-minut e changes.”  A “stager” (stager) is a person whose job it is to make the home look nice.

 Sometimes when people move and they haven’t sold their h ouse, the house will be empty when people come to look at it.  Real estate a gents have found that people are more likely to buy a house if they can imagin e themselves in the house, and that means putting things in the house – the  empty house – that will help you imagine what the house will look like.  So you put a bed in, you put a television in, you put pictures on the wall.  None of th ese belong to the owner; they’re just there to help the people looking at the h ouse to get a better picture, if you will, of what the house looks like when there is fur niture inside.  “To make last-minute changes” means to change something right befo re the event starts, in the last hour or maybe last day.

Ernie says, “She really doesn’t need to do anything else (that is, the stager).  We did everything our agent told us to do.  We made cosmeti c repairs, painted, and de-cluttered.”  “To repair (something)” is to fix it.  A “cosmetic repair” improves the appearance of something, in this case the appearan ce of the house.  You don’t actually make it a better house, or a stronger or  a safer house; you may paint the walls, for example.  That’s a cosmetic change.  You may fix something that is broken so that it looks better; that would be a cosmetic repair.  “To clutter” (clutter) means to put too many things in a space, on you r desk or in a room, so that it looks crowded.  “To de-clutter,” then, means to  take away things so that the space is more open, that you can see the desk, you can see  the room better.

Kyoko says the stager is doing some minor landscaping.  “Land scaping” is when you do something with the plants, the trees, the grass ou tside of a home to make it more beautiful.  She says that the stager is putting  some plants along the front path, where people walk into the house.  “Let’s get ou t of here before people start showing up,” she says.  “To show up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to arrive, to appear, to come to a particular event or pla ce: “What time did your brother show up last night?”  You were waiting for hi m, he was late, he didn’t show up until 8:00.  Kyoko says, “I don’t want to seem li ke I’m spying on my own house.”  “To spy on (something)” means to look at it in se cret, to get information.

Ernie says, “What does it matter (what difference does it  make)?  Hand me the fact sheet for our house.”  “Hand me” means give me – pu t in my hand – the fact sheet.  A “fact sheet” is a piece of paper with detail ed information about something; it could be about anything.  For a house, the fact sheet would have the price, how big the house is, and so forth.  Ernie says, “I want to read it through (meaning I want to read it completely) again to make sure the agent didn’t miss anything.  Okay, the square footage on the house and the lot are correct.”  The “square footage” is the number of square feet in a particular area; it’s a way of measuring the size of a house.  The “lot” ( lot) is the land that the

 house sits on, or the building sits on.  “Lot” has a coupl e of other meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional defi nitions.

Then Ernie says that the real estate agent noted, or pu t on the paper, that our addition is permitted, and she mentioned the upgrades.   An “addition” to a house is a new part of the house that was built after the original house.  The word “addition” has some additional definitions; once again , the Learning Guide will help you.  When we say that a part of the house or a bu ilding is “permitted,” we mean that it has all the necessary permissions and governme nt documents.  If you decide you want to add a new room to your house, you need to get permission from the city, and the city comes and looks at it  to make sure that what you built is safe.  This is part of getting someth ing permitted.  Many people, at least here in Los Angeles, because it’s so expensive to g et a government permit – a government approval – will add things to th eir house without getting approval from the government.  Of course, if the gover nment finds out, they’ll have to pay for the permit; but usually the government  is too busy trying to do other things, like spend our money!  Ernie said that the real estate agent mentioned the upgrades.  An “upgrade” is an improvemen t to something.  For a home, usually it’s making the home better, perhaps by pu tting in a nicer kitchen, putting in a nicer refrigerator.  These would be upgr ades.  Changing the carpet, that would be also a minor upgrade; more cosmetic tha n anything else, but still, it makes the house nicer.

Well, Kyoko says that she doesn’t want to sit in the car for  the next four hours during the open house.  She says, “Let’s go to visit our n eighbors’ open houses.” Ernie says, “Good idea.  We’ll see what our competition  is and maybe we can steal some of their open house ideas!”  So, Ernie and K yoko are going to look at other open houses, just like I mentioned earlier people  often do, to see if they can get some ideas about selling their house.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Kyoko:  We’re not supposed to be here.  I think we shoul d leave and let our real estate agent hold the open house without us looking over  her shoulder.

Ernie:  We’re not looking over her shoulder.  I just wa nt to sit in this car to see how many people go in and out.

Kyoko:  You know, there’ll be a lot of lookie-loos.  And  plus, there’ll be a sign-in sheet, so we’ll be able to see afterwards how many peopl e stopped in.

 Ernie:  Hey, someone’s coming in now.

Kyoko:  That’s the stager.  She’s making some last-minute changes.

Ernie:  She really doesn’t need to do anything else.  W e did everything our agent told us to do.  We made cosmetic repairs, painted, and de-cluttered.  What more could they ask for?

Ernie:  What does it matter?  Hand me the fact sheet for our house.  I want to read it through again to make sure the agent didn’t miss anything.  Okay, the square footage on the house and the lot are correct, s he noted that our addition is permitted, and she mentioned the upgrades – good.  Where are you going?

Kyoko:  I’m not going to sit in this car for the next fou r hours.  Let’s go to visit our neighbors’ open houses.

Ernie:  Good idea.  We’ll see what our competition is and maybe we can steal some of their open house ideas!

# Shopping for a Hat

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 47: Shopping for a Hat.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 547.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Shopping for a Hat.”  Christine and Eric are trying to buy a hat, and we’ll, of course, be introduced to lots of vocab ulary related to hats.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Christine:  What do you think of this one?

Eric:  We’re here to buy hats to protect us from the sun while we’re on vacation. Do you think a beret will do that?

Christine:  No, but it looks great on me, don’t you th ink?  Isn’t it great to be getting away to the beach in the middle of winter!  I  already picked out a straw hat with a wide, floppy brim, so I’m all set for the t rip.

Eric:  In that case, help me pick one out.  How about t his baseball cap?

Christine:  Well, the brim gives your face plenty of shade , but it leaves the back of your head exposed.  How about this helmet?

Eric:  Very funny.  Do you want me to suffocate in this t hing?  Okay, hand me that cowboy hat.

Christine:  That looks cute on you, but it’s huge and it ’s going to get squished in the luggage.  Hey, try these two hats on!

Eric:  Stop messing around.  I don’t need a top hat, a nd that one looks like a bonnet!

 Christine:  Okay, okay, how about this straw hat?  Like min e, it’s soft enough to travel in a suitcase.

Eric:  Hey, this one isn’t bad.  How do I look?

Christine:  Just like the tourist that you are, but that makes two of us.

Eric:  I couldn’t care less.  I don’t care if I look cool on vacation as long as I am cool!

[end of dialogue]

Christine says to Eric, “What do you think of this one?”  S he’s showing Eric a “hat,” something you put on your head.  Eric says, “We’ re here to buy hats to protect us from the sun while we’re on vacation.”  “T o protect (something)” means to keep it safe or to keep it out of danger.  Er ic wants to protect his face and his neck so that the sun doesn’t hit it and give him “sunburn,” when the sun makes your skin red and dry.  Eric says, “Do you think a bere t will do that?”  A “beret” is a small, round hat, with a tight piece next  to the head.  It’s traditionally something associated with the French, and it would almost  certainly be too small to protect against much of the sun.  You don’t see ber ets very often in the U.S., although at certain times they were popular.  There wa s a song by the rock singer Prince that was called “Raspberry Beret.”  [Jeff sin gs]  She wore a raspberry beret... See, it’s about a girl he likes that is wearing a beret  that is the color of a raspberry, which is a small red fruit.

Anyway, Christine tells Eric that no, the beret will not  protect against the sun. She says, “it looks great on me, don’t you think (the bere t)?  Isn’t it great to be getting away to the beach in the middle of the winter !”  “To get away” means usually to go on a vacation, to go to another part of the country or the world. Christine says, “I already picked out a straw hat with a w ide, floppy brim, so I’m all set for the trip.”  A “straw hat” is a hat made fr om dried pieces of hay or grass that have been put together; we would say they’ve been “woven” together.  This hat has a wide, floppy brim.  The “brim” (brim) is the part of the hat that extends, or sticks out, beyond the head to protect your face.  It can  also go around and protect the back of your neck.  So the brim is the part of  the hat is not directly on your head; it extends out in front, sometimes on the side s and in the back.  A “floppy brim” is one that is flexible; it moves easily.  “F loppy,” as an adjective, means something that usually hangs down a little bit, is flexible.  You can think of the ears of a dog.  Some dogs have floppy ears; they hang  down and they’re flexible.

 Christine says she’s all set for the trip, meaning she’s rea dy for the trip.  Eric says, “In that case, help me pick one out (help me select on e).  How about this baseball cap?”  He means what do you think of: “How abou t this baseball cap?” A “cap” is just another word for a hat that is very small,  that fits, we would say, closely around the head.  But there’s a part in front t hat sticks out – there’s a brim that sticks out in front.  We call these baseball caps becau se they’re the kind of caps, or hats, that baseball players wear.  If you ever h ave seen an American baseball game, you know what these hats look like.  They’re  very popular for people not playing baseball as well.  I have a couple of  baseball caps that I use to keep the sun away from my face – to protect my face fro m the sun.

Christine says, “Well, the brim gives your face plenty of sh ade, but it leaves the back of your head exposed.”  “Shade” is an area of darkness that is created when the sun or some bright light is blocked, so that you  can’t see the light.  For example, if you are in a park, and there’s a tree, and  the sun is coming up in the sky, you can stand by the tree so that the tree is blocking the sun.  You would be in the shade; the tree is shading you, it’s giving you p rotection from the sun.  The word “shade,” along with the word “brim,” has other m eanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  Chri stine says the baseball cap gives Eric shade in the front, but not in the back.  S he says, “the back of your is head exposed.”  “To be exposed” can mean that other people can see you or see something.  Here, it really means not protected.  In  other words, the back of the head will not be protected from the sun.  Christin e suggests to Eric, “How about this helmet?” meaning what do think about this h elmet, here’s something else you can wear.  A “helmet” (helmet) is a very large,  heavy, strong hat.  It’s typically used by people who are riding motorcycles; they oft en wear helmets. Soldiers in an army will often have a helmet to protect  their head.  That’s a helmet.

Of course, Christine isn’t serious, because you would not wear a helmet just to protect your head from the sun.  So Eric says, “Very funny ,” which is an expression that we use sometimes to mean that’s not very f unny, I don’t think you’re very funny.  So Eric says, “Very funny.  Do you want me to suffocate in this thing?”  “To suffocate” means to not be able to b reathe, usually because something is covering your mouth.  Eric says, “Okay, hand me that cowboy hat.” A “cowboy hat” is a large hat that has a soft top and a very large brim – a large, circular area that goes around the entire head.  Tradi tionally, it was a hat worn by men in the American West when they rode horses.  So if yo u ever have seen a movie, which we would call a “Western,” about 19th century in the western part of the U.S., you have seen, no doubt, a cowboy hat.  Cowbo y hats are still worn by men in some parts of this country, not so much here in S outhern California.

 Eric wants the cowboy hat, and Christine says that it looks cute on him, meaning it looks nice on him; it looks good when he’s wearing it .  “But,” she says, “it’s huge (it’s very big) and it’s going to get squished in the luggage.”  “To get squished” (squished) means to put a lot of pressure on som ething, and you, without wanting to, will make it smaller and it will lose its shape.  There’s a similar verb, “to squash,” which doesn’t help you very much.  You  can think of a soft hat, like a baseball cap or a cowboy hat, that has a big book o n top of it.  Well, the book will press against the hat and make it flat; it wil l squish it.

Christine then gives Eric two more hats to try on, meanin g to put on to see if he likes them.  Eric says, “Stop messing around,” meaning sto p joking, stop fooling around.  She has given him two hats that he is obviously n ot going to wear as a joke.  One of them is a top hat.  A “top hat” is a very tall hat, usually black or gray, that is sometimes, not very often, worn by men for a  formal occasion. Abraham Lincoln, our 16th president, is often pictured in a top hat.  It’s an ol d- fashioned kind of hat that you don’t see very much anymor e.  Christine also gave Eric a bonnet (bonnet).  A “bonnet” is a hat worn by w omen, where you put a certain piece of fabric over the head, and then there’ s a string down below that that you tie underneath your chin.  Once again, it’s an  old-fashioned hat for the most part, not that common anymore.

Christine says, “Okay, okay, how about this straw hat?  Like  mine, it’s soft enough to travel in a suitcase.”  Eric says, “Hey, this on e isn’t bad (meaning it’s pretty good).  How do I look?”  Christine says, “Just like the tourist that you are,” meaning you look like a “tourist,” someone who obviously i s visiting a place. “But,” she says, “that makes two of us.”  The phrase “tha t makes two of us” is used to show that the same thing is true for you, often when you agree with what someone says or what applies to their situation applies to your situation. Someone could say to you, “I’m worried about losing my j ob in this economy,” and the other person says, “That makes two of us.”  They me an they are also worried about losing their job.

Eric says, “I couldn’t care less (meaning it doesn’t bother me that I look like a tourist).  I don’t care if I look cool on my vacation as long as I am  cool!”  Here, “cool” has two different meanings.  In the first case, “i f I look cool” means if I look attractive, interesting, something that other people wo uld like.  “Cool,” as an adjective, used to describe things that are popular, at least it was a few years ago.  “Cool” can also mean a comfortable temperature, a temperature that is not too hot.  So, Eric is using both meanings here.  He says a s long as I am cool, meaning I’m not hot, I don’t care if I don’t look cool , meaning if I don’t look attractive, if people don’t think what I’m wearing is a ttractive.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Christine:  What do you think of this one?

Eric:  We’re here to buy hats to protect us from the sun while we’re on vacation. Do you think a beret will do that?

Christine:  No, but it looks great on me, don’t you th ink?  Isn’t it great to be getting away to the beach in the middle of winter!  I  already picked out a straw hat with a wide, floppy brim, so I’m all set for the t rip.

Eric:  In that case, help me pick one out.  How about t his baseball cap?

Christine:  Well, the brim gives your face plenty of shade , but it leaves the back of your head exposed.  How about this helmet?

Eric:  Very funny.  Do you want me to suffocate in this t hing?  Okay, hand me that cowboy hat.

Christine:  That looks cute on you, but it’s huge and it ’s going to get squished in the luggage.  Hey, try these two hats on!

Eric:  Stop messing around.  I don’t need a top hat, a nd that one looks like a bonnet!

Christine:  Okay, okay, how about this straw hat?  Like min e, it’s soft enough to travel in a suitcase.

Eric:  Hey, this one isn’t bad.  How do I look?

Christine:  Just like the tourist that you are, but that makes two of us.

Eric:  I couldn’t care less.  I don’t care if I look cool on vacation as long as I am cool!

# Working for an Impossible Boss

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 48: Working for an Impossible Boss.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 548.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode.  You can also go to our website to take a look at our ESL Podcast Store for additional courses in English, and our ESL Podcast Bl og, where you can pick up additional vocabulary, cultural information, and some  hints on improving your English.

This episode is called “Working for an Impossible Boss.”  the word “impossible” (not possible) here means a boss who is very difficult to w ork for, somebody who is so difficult we may say that it is almost impossible to w ork for this person.  It’s a dialogue between Mr. Mann and Laura, and uses some v ocabulary that you might find when you are having an argument with your b oss.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mr. Mann:  Why are all these people milling around do ing no work?  Laura! You’re in charge when I’m out of the office and you’re  incompetent!

Laura:  Mr. Mann, we need to talk in private.  Let’s g o into your office.

Mr. Mann:  What is this about?

Laura:  Mr. Mann, I’ve tried to do my job the best I ca n, but I won’t tolerate your verbal abuse any longer.

Mr. Mann:  Verbal abuse?!  I’m just telling it like it is.  It’s my…it’s my…management style.  This is business.  If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

Laura:  If I thought this was about my performance, I w ould certainly take any constructive criticism, but this is really about your inappr opriate behavior.

 Mr. Mann:  What inappropriate behavior?  You’re quest ioning my behavior?

Laura:  Yes, I’ve held my tongue long enough.  Every day,  you come back to the office tipsy from a three-martini lunch, and you go off on me in front of the other employees.  That undermines my authority and puts me in a n impossible position.

Mr. Mann:  I’m your boss and you have no right to questi on the way I run this house…I mean, department.

Laura:  With all due respect, this is no way to run a de partment.

Mr. Mann:  And how dare you suggest that I’m drunk?  Yo u don’t know who you’re dealing with.

Laura:  Oh, yes I do.  You’re my ex-boss.  I’ve had enoug h.  I quit!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Mr. Mann asking Laura, “Why are all these people milling around doing no work?”  “To mill (mill) arou nd” is a phrasal verb meaning to be in an area without doing anything productive or without having a purpose; we would also say “to hang around.”  A more technical te rm would be “to loiter” (loiter).  Sometimes you’ll see signs outside of stores tha t say “No loitering,” that means you can’t just stand there and look around, you have to have some purpose while you’re there.  Usually it means you just can’ t stand there – you can’t be there.  In an office, if people are loiterin g – if people are milling around, well, they’re not really doing anything; they should be working, in this case.  So Mr. Mann says, “Laura!  You’re in charge when I’m out of the office and you’re incompetent!”  “To be in charge” means to have the resp onsibility for something, to have power over a project or other people.  Usually, it’s the power to tell them what to do – have the authority to tell them what to do.  So when Mr. Mann is not in the office, Laura becomes the boss.  By the way, the wo rd “charge” has several different meanings in English; you can find those meanings in the Learning Guide for today on our website.

Mr. Mann says that Laura is incompetent.  “To be compete nt” means to be capable, to be able to do something.  “To be incompete nt” means to be not competent, incapable, unable to do something often bec ause you don’t have

 enough experience or perhaps because you’re not very smar t, at least that’s what Mr. Mann seems to think.

Laura says, “Mr. Mann, we need to talk in private (mea ning with nobody else around).  Let’s go into your office.”  Mr. Mann says, “What is this about?”  Laura then replies, “Mr. Mann, I’ve tried to do my job the b est I can, but I won’t tolerate your verbal abuse any longer.”  “Verbal” refers to some thing that is spoken, something that someone says.  “Abuse” is when someone is hur ting another person, either physically or psychologically.  So, “verbal abu se” would be someone who is yelling at you, calling you names, perhaps sw earing, saying bad things about you that are way more than what they should  be saying to you.  This is what is happening to Laura, so she says she won’t “toler ate,” she won’t put up with, his verbal abuse.

Mr. Mann says, “Verbal abuse?!”  He’s surprised and shocked,  maybe a little angry.  “I’m just telling it like it is,” meaning I am just describing the truth, the real situation here.  “It’s my…it’s my… management style,” he says.  “Management” has to do with the way that you work with other people,  usually as a boss.  You manage them – you control them.  “Style” is the way that  you do something, so your “management style” is the way that you work with oth er people, especially when you’re the boss.  So Mr. Mann is a little angry her e; he says, “This is business.  If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kit chen.”  This is an old expression: “If you can’t take (meaning if you can’t toler ate – if you can’t put up with) the heat, you should get out of (you should leave ) the kitchen.”  A “kitchen,” of course, is where you prepare food, and it’s often hot  in a kitchen.  So, if you can’t put up with the heat – if you can’t tolerate the  heat, then you shouldn’t be in the kitchen.  The idea is that you should not be in a p lace or a situation unless you can handle the pressure and stress.  If you are in a d ifficult situation and you cannot handle it, well then, you should leave it.  It’s often said to people who complain about their situation because it is stressful or i t is difficult.  The popular belief in the United States is that this expression was “co ined,” that is this expression was invented by a U.S. President, President Har ry Truman, who was president after Franklin Roosevelt, up until January of 1953.

So, Mr. Mann is saying that Laura has to listen to him e ven if he yells at her. Laura says, “If I thought this was about my performance, I would certainly take any constructive criticism, but this is really about your inapp ropriate behavior.” She’s saying that this is not about her “performance,” wh at she does.  If it were about that, she would “take any constructive criticism,” she  would accept any advice about how she can improve.  That’s what constructive criticism is.

 “Criticism” is when you tell someone they’re doing somethi ng wrong; “constructive criticism” is when you are telling them thing s they are doing wrong in order that they can improve – so that they can get b etter.  That’s the idea.  But Laura thinks that Mr. Mann’s “behavior,” the way he is ta lking to her, is “inappropriate.”  This is a common word now you hear; p eople say, “That’s inappropriate,” they mean it isn’t something that you should be doing or saying either because it’s rude or because it doesn’t belong in  that particular situation or environment.  So if you work at a business office, and you come in one day with your shorts on and a baseball cap (a baseball hat) and a T-shirt, and everyone else is wearing suits and ties and dresses, someone might say to you, “Your dress today is inappropriate.”  It’s not right for this si tuation, and that’s what Laura is saying to Mr. Mann.

Well, Mr. Mann…he’s, uh, not very interested in hearing Laura’s opinion.  He says, “What inappropriate behavior?  You’re questioning my behavior?” meaning you’re asking questions; you’re doubting the way I do thin gs; you’re criticizing me.  Laura says, “Yes, I’ve held my tongue long enough.”  “To hold your tongue” means to not say something even though you want to, to s tay quiet even when you really want to say something.  Laura says that she has held her tongue long enough, “Every day, you come back to the office tipsy from a  three-martini lunch.”  “To be tipsy” (tipsy) means to be a little bit d runk, to have had an alcoholic drink.  It makes you a little silly or a little stupid.  It’s not completely drunk, but it is a little bit drunk, if you will.  “Mar tini” is a type of drink.  There’s an old expression: “the three-martini lunch,” meaning inste ad of going to lunch and eating food, especially if you’re a business executive or m anager, you spend your time drinking instead.  “The three-martini lunch” represents someone wasting their time; doing things, because they are the boss, that they shouldn’t be doing.  “The three-martini lunch” expression is not as common anymore.  In part, that’s because it used to be many years ago that b usinesses could include the cost of business lunches as a business expense.  However, in  the recent years the government has changed the regulations so that n ow you can only count half of that lunch as being a business expense, so the  three-martini lunch is not as popular.

Laura says to Mr. Mann, “you go off on me in front of  the other employees.”  “To go off on (someone)” means to lose your temper and pati ence, to criticize someone else, to shout or yell at them, especially if you are really angry about something.  Notice the expression is “to go off on (someon e).”  You can say, “he went off” or “don’t go off” without the “on” if you mean don’t get angry, don’t start yelling.  If you want to talk about who someone is yellin g at, who someone is

 angry with, then you would say, “He’s going off on Laura ,” or whomever.  Laura says that when Mr. Mann goes off on her in front of oth er employees that that undermines her authority.  “To undermine (someone’s) au thority” means to decrease the amount of power that someone has, to weake n their ability to be respected by other people.  So you’d undermine someone’s authority by doing things that would make other people not respect them, not listen to them.

Mr. Mann says, “I’m your boss and you have no right to quest ion (to criticize) the way I run this house.”  “Run,” here, means to manage.  “…I mean,” Mr. Mann says, “department.”  Of course, Mr. Mann suddenly thinks tha t he’s at home, perhaps arguing with one of his children.  Laura says, “ With all due respect, this is no way to run a department.”  “With all due respect”  is a polite phrase that you use when you disagree with someone and you want to give your opinion without making them angry.  So Laura says, “With all due respect,  this is no way to run a department.”

Mr. Mann is still angry; he says, “And how dare you suggest that I’m drunk?” “How dare you?” is a phrase used when you are very angry and shocked by what someone has said, usually because they have criticized you: “Ho w dare you come into my house and yell at me?  Get out of my hous e!  How dare you?”  Mr. Mann then says, “You don’t know who you’re dealing with .”  This expression, “you don’t know who you’re dealing with,” is used when you’re very angry and you want to emphasize to the other person that you are ve ry powerful, very important, too powerful and important to be treated  the way you are being treated.

Laura says, “Oh, yes I do.  You’re my ex-boss.”  “Ex,” here , means former, used to.  I can say, “Angelina Jolie is my ex-girlfriend” or “ Halle Berry is my ex- girlfriend.”  I could say that – it’s not true, but I co uld say that!  That would be an example of “ex,” former, used to, not anymore.  Laura i s really saying here that she’s quitting.  She says, “I’ve had enough (meaning I can not stand or tolerate your behavior anymore).  I quit!”  And she leaves the off ice and she goes back to school to study biology or she gets another job – you can in vent the end of the story!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Mr. Mann:  Why are all these people milling around do ing no work?  Laura! You’re in charge when I’m out of the office and you’re  incompetent!

Laura:  Mr. Mann, we need to talk in private.  Let’s g o into your office.

Mr. Mann:  What is this about?

Laura:  Mr. Mann, I’ve tried to do my job the best I ca n, but I won’t tolerate your verbal abuse any longer.

Mr. Mann:  Verbal abuse?!  I’m just telling it like it is.  It’s my…it’s my…management style.  This is business.  If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

Laura:  Yes, I’ve held my tongue long enough.  Every day,  you come back to the office tipsy from a three-martini lunch, and you go off on me in front of the other employees.  That undermines my authority and puts me in a n impossible position.

Mr. Mann:  I’m your boss and you have no right to questi on the way I run this house…I mean, department.

Laura:  With all due respect, this is no way to run a de partment.

Mr. Mann:  And how dare you suggest that I’m drunk?  Yo u don’t know who you’re dealing with.

Laura:  Oh, yes I do.  You’re my ex-boss.  I’ve had enoug h.  I quit!

# Using a Camera

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 49: Using a Camera.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 549.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “Using a Camera.”  It’s a dialogue  between Ingrid and Deng using vocabulary common to discussions related to camer as.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ingrid:  I don’t mind lending you my camera for the tr ip, but first, let me show you how to use it.

Deng:  No need to do that.  I took a photography class i n high school, and I pretty much know all there is to know about taking pictures.

Ingrid:  Wasn’t that a long time ago?  This is a digit al camera with some new features.  For instance, this camera has auto zoom, image  stabilization, and a memory card.

Deng:  It can’t be that different from the camera I u sed 15 years ago.  This looks like a point-and-shoot.  You look through the viewer a nd push the button, right?

Ingrid:  Well, not quite.  You can adjust the flash an d shutter speed, see?  You can also attach a lens for wide-angle or close-up shots.  You can even review your photos, saving the ones you like or deleting the ones you don’t want anymore.

Deng:  Okay, I got it.  By the way you’re talking, you’d t hink I was born yesterday. Just show me where to load the film!

 [end of dialogue]

Ingrid says to Deng, “I don’t mind lending you my camera  for your trip, but first, let me show you how to use it.”  A “camera,” as you prob ably know, is a device that you use to take photographs.  Ingrid is going to “lend,” let Deng use, her camera for his trip.  Deng says, “No need to do that (me aning you don’t need to show me how to use it).  I took a photography class in hig h school, and I pretty much know all there is to know about taking pictures.”  “P hotography” is – I guess we could call it the art and science of taking good phot ographs (good pictures). Deng says he’s an expert.  He says, “I pretty much (meaning I almost know) all there is to know (everything) about taking pictures.”  “Pi ctures” is just another word we use for photographs.

Ingrid says, “Wasn’t that a long time ago?  This is a dig ital camera with some new features.”  Up until recently, when for example I w as growing up, cameras had “film,” which is pieces of plastic, basically, that ha ve special chemicals on them.  When you expose those chemicals to light and then later put them in other chemicals, you ended up with a photograph.  Nowadays many cameras are digital, so there is no film; everything is stored electr onically on a small memory stick or memory chip that is inside the camera or connected t o the camera.

Ingrid says, “For instance (for example), this camera has a uto zoom, image stabilization, and a memory card.”  “Auto” is short for  automatic, something that happens without you needing to do anything.  “Zoom” (z oom), when we’re talking about a camera, is the ability to change the view so tha t something that is far away seems very close.  “Auto zoom” would be the ability for  the camera to automatically “detect,” or automatically know how far some thing is and zoom in on it so you could get a better, closer picture of it.  “Image stabilization” is a feature on some cameras that allows the camera to keep the image (what you are taking a picture of) “in focus,” meaning very clear, e ven though your hand is moving.  “Memory cards” are small, usually square or rectang ular pieces of electronic equipment that are used to store data.  It’ s like a DVD or a CD can be used to store movies and photographs and other documents.  Memory cards in a camera are used to “store,” or used to keep, the digita l images – the photographs.  If you want to take even more photograph s, you can put in a different memory card with more memory.

Deng says, “It can’t be that different from the camera I  used 15 years ago.  This looks like a point-and-shoot.”  The phrase “point-and-sho ot” means that it’s a

 very simple camera where you just hold up the camera, put it in the direction of the thing you want to take a photograph of, and push o r press a button that then takes the photograph.  There’s no adjustments that you ha ve to make before you take the photo.  It’s a very simple kind of camera for dum b people like me, who don’t know how to use cameras very well.  But I did take a photography class in high school!  Deng says, “You look through the viewer and push the button, right?”  The “viewer” is the small, rectangular openin g in the back of the camera that you look through to see what you are going to take  a picture of – to see the image of that you are going to take the photograph of .  That’s a viewer.  “Viewer” has a couple of other meanings however, so take a look at  the Learning Guide for those.

Ingrid says, “Well, not quite.  You can adjust the flash and shutter speed, see?” She’s showing him.  The “flash” is the bright light tha t lasts for a very short period of time that gives you more light so that you can see wha t is in front of you; it will appear better on the photograph.  That’s a flash.  “S hutter speed” is the amount of time that the small window inside of the camera is open.  A slow shutter speed means that you need more light; a fast shutter speed me ans you need less light. So if you’re out in the sun and it’s very bright out, yo u would not need a slow shutter speed.  “Shutter” is just the name of the littl e window that opens and closes rapidly that exposes the film in an old camera – the electronic sensing equipment inside the camera, what the camera uses to con vert that light into a digital image.

Ingrid says, “You can also attach a lens for wide-angle o r close-up shots.” “Wide-angle” means that it is a “lens,” something that  you put on the front of the camera, that creates photographs with a wider than normal view.  A “close-up” is when you want to be very close or near to something, when  there is very little distance between the camera and what you are taking a pi cture of.  You could take a close-up of someone’s face, for example.  Ingrid sa ys, “You can even review your photos (look at your photos after you’ve taking them), saving the ones you like or deleting the ones you don’t want anymore .”  So the camera has sort of a little computer that allows you to see the pho tographs on the back and delete the ones you don’t want.

Deng says, “Okay, I got it (meaning I understand).  By the way you’re talking, you’d think I was born yesterday.”  “By the way you’re talki ng” means the way that you are talking to me indicates that you “think I w as born yesterday.”  The expression “born yesterday” means that someone is inexperience d, someone who is naïve, someone who is easily tricked or lied to.  You may say, “Of course I

 know how to use a fax machine.  I wasn’t born yesterday!”  Someone who would be born yesterday would, of course, be a very small baby wh o wouldn’t know anything.  But you have experience, you do know something , and therefore you weren’t born yesterday.  Deng says, “Just show me where to load the film!”  “To load” means to put something into something else, especia lly when it is needed to make it work.  So if you have a copier (a copy machine) , you need to load paper into it; you need to put paper into the machine  so that you can make your copies.  “Film,” we already mentioned, is a long, thin piece of plastic used in older cameras to record the image – to capture the image, t he light that comes in.  The question indicates, of course, that Deng really doesn’t kn ow what he’s talking about, since digital cameras don’t have film!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ingrid:  I don’t mind lending you my camera for the tr ip, but first, let me show you how to use it.

Deng:  No need to do that.  I took a photography class i n high school, and I pretty much know all there is to know about taking pictures.

# Differences in Male and Female Friendships

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 50: Differences in Male and Female Friendships.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 550.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even fast er.

This episode is called “Differences in Male and Female F riendships.”  It’s a dialogue between Lauren and Quentin, and talks about how men and women are different when it comes to their friends, using a lot of vocabulary you might use when talking about friendship.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lauren:  Did you see what Stephanie was wearing?  She looked like a wet dog!

Quentin:  Why do women do that?

Lauren:  Do what?

Quentin:  Why do women put other women down?  Is it t o make themselves feel superior?

Lauren:  It was only a joke.  I didn’t mean anything by it.

Quentin:  Do you really think she would find it funny i f she had heard you?

Lauren:  What about you men?  You guys are always banter ing and trying to one-up each other.  Aren’t you guys trying to see who’s su perior and who’s inferior?

Quentin:  Women are catty and talk behind each other’s b acks.  We men make fun of each other in a good-natured way while we’re together.  That’s the difference: You women are laughing at  each other and we men are laughing with each other.

 Lauren:  Oh yeah?  Was Tim laughing with  you guys when you threw him into the lake last weekend?

Quentin:  That was very funny, and yes, he thought it wa s funny, too.  What you women don’t understand is that we give as good as we get .  Next time, Tim will play a trick on someone else.

Lauren:  So it’s a vicious cycle of pranks.

Quentin:  Yeah, you could say that.  That’s how men bond .  That’s something you women don’t seem to understand.

Lauren:  We understand, all right.  You take turns to rturing each other and call it male bonding.

Quentin:  See what I mean?  You women stick to your wa ys and we’ll stick to ours.

[end of dialogue]

Lauren begins by asking Quentin, “Did you see what Steph anie was wearing? She looked like a wet dog!”  A “wet dog” I guess is an i nsulting term; a wet dog would not look very good, I guess is the idea.  Quentin says, “Why do women do that?”  Lauren says, “Do what?” meaning I don’t unders tand what you’re talking about.  Quentin says, “Why do women put other women do wn?”  “To put (someone) down” is a phrasal verb meaning to say somethin g that makes another person seem or feel less important; to say someth ing mean, something not nice about someone else is to put them down.  Quent in is asking Lauren why women put other women down, why they insult other wom en.  Quentin says, “Is it to make themselves feel superior?”  “Superior” means bett er than someone else. The opposite of “superior” is “inferior.”

So, Quentin is asking Lauren if women insult each other – say bad things about each other – to make themselves feel superior, like they’r e better than the other women.  Lauren says, “It was only a joke.  I didn’t mean anything by it.”  When someone says they “don’t mean anything by it,” they mean t hat they know that they said something that was not kind – that was mean, bu t they didn’t really want to hurt anyone’s feelings.  Usually we say this when w e say something bad but we aren’t thinking about it very clearly before we say it, and after we say it we regret it.  We think, “Oh, I should not have done tha t,” and so we say “Oh, I didn’t mean anything by it.”  I didn’t mean – I didn’t inte nd to hurt her.

 Quentin says, “Do you really think she would find it funn y if she had heard you?” What Quentin is saying here is that Lauren’s comment wa s not a joke, it was not funny, and Stephanie would not think it funny if she he ard it.  Lauren says, “What about you men?  You guys are always bantering and trying to one-up each other.”  “To banter” (banter) means to have a friend ly conversation with lots of jokes, especially jokes about other people in the conversat ion.  So when people banter, they’re making jokes and some of those jokes are a bout the people in that group.  Lauren says, “You guys (you men) are always b antering and trying to one-up each other.”  “To “one-up (someone)” means to d o or say something to show that you can do something better than the other pe rson; you are superior to the other person; you can beat them.  Lauren is saying th at men are always trying to one-up each other, to be better – to seem b etter than the other.  “Aren’t you guys trying to see who’s superior and who’s inferior?”  Remember, “inferior” is the opposite of “superior,” it means worse than some one or something else.

Quentin says, “Women are catty and talk behind each other ’s backs.”  “To be catty” (catty) means that you say nice things about someone w hen they are there – when they are next to you or in front of you, but th en when they leave – when they are not there you say mean things or unkind things a bout them.  So you could say to someone, “Oh, that’s a beautiful dress you ha ve on Maria,” and Maria walks away and you say to your friend, “That is the  ugliest dress I have ever seen!”  That would be catty.  Quentin is saying that  women are catty.  I’m not saying women are catty – Quentin is saying that; I wan t to make that very clear!  Quentin also says that women talk behind each oth er’s back.  “To talk behind (someone’s) back” means to say bad things about a nother person when he or she can’t hear them, doesn’t know what you are sayi ng.  You tell everyone that you think the boss is a terrible manager, but when the boss is there in the room you don’t say anything.  That’s talking behind someo ne’s back.  Quentin says, “We men make fun of each other in a good-natured w ay while we’re together.”  “To make fun of (someone or something)” me ans to make jokes about that thing or that person.  To make fun of someone is u sually considered mean – not nice, but Quentin says that when men do it they are doing in a good-natured way.  “Good-natured” means in a friendly way.  You’re n ot really being mean; you’re not really being unkind.  Quentin says, “That’s the  difference: You women are laughing at  each other and we men are laughing with  each other.”

Lauren says, “Oh yeah (meaning she doesn’t believe what Q uentin is saying)? Was Tim laughing with  you guys when you threw him into the lake last weekend?”  Apparently Quentin and his friends threw Tim , another friend, into a lake – I’m not sure why – as a joke.  In fact, Quentin says,  “That was very funny,

 and yes, he thought (Tim thought) it was funny, too.  W hat you women don’t understand is that we give as good as we get.”  “To give  as good as you get” is an expression that means we do to another person whateve r he or she has done to us; usually it’s in a negative way.  So you, as a man, m ay make a joke about another friend – another man, but that friend will also make a joke about you, so you give as good as you get.  “Next time,” Quentin says, “T im will play a trick on someone else.”  “To play a trick on (someone)” means to fo ol or deceive someone, to do something that surprises someone and makes that person looks silly or stupid.

Lauren says, “So it’s a vicious cycle of pranks.”  A “vicious (vici ous) cycle” is a situation where A causes B, which causes C, which causes A, whi ch causes B, and so forth; that one thing causes another thing that  causes another thing that causes the first thing, and the cycle repeats.  Things go a round and around.  A vicious cycle is usually a cycle or a situation where things are getting worse and worse.  When the economy is bad, people lose their jobs , and when they lose their jobs they don’t have money to buy things at the sto re.  And when they don’t have money to buy things at the store, the people in the  store lose their jobs and they have less money to spend, and that causes more people  to lose their jobs. So it’s a vicious cycle.  A “prank” (prank) is some sort of tri ck – some sort of joke, but it’s usually something you do.  When I was young in scho ol one popular prank was to go to someone’s house that you didn’t like an d throw toilet paper all over the trees.  I never did this, honestly!  But that wa s a prank that some other people did – I won’t name any names!

Quentin says, “You could say that (meaning yes, it’s a viciou s cycle of pranks). That’s how men bond” (bond).  “Bond” means to develop a close relationship with someone.  It is no relation to Bond – James Bond, the famous British spy, 007. This is a different kind of bond.  Here it’s a verb, an d it means to have a close connection or relationship with someone.  Quentin says, “T hat’s something you women don’t seem to understand.”

Lauren says, “We understand, all right (meaning yes, in  fact, we do understand). You take turns torturing each other and call it male bo nding.”  “To torture (someone)” means to cause pain, either physical or psycholo gical, usually because you are trying to get someone to do something, t o give you information perhaps.  Quentin says, “See what I mean (now do you und erstand)?  You women stick to your ways and we’ll stick to ours (we men wil l stick to ours).”  “To stick to” is a phrasal verb meaning continue doing somethi ng, continue using something without changing.  I’m going to stick to recor ding podcasts because I’m not very good at anything else.  That’s pretty much tr ue!

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue again, this time at a  normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lauren:  Did you see what Stephanie was wearing?  She looked like a wet dog!

Quentin:  Why do women do that?

Lauren:  Do what?

Quentin:  Why do women put other women down?  Is it t o make themselves feel superior?

Lauren:  It was only a joke.  I didn’t mean anything by it.

Quentin:  Do you really think that she would find it f unny if she had heard you?

Lauren:  What about you men?  You guys are always banter ing and trying to one-up each other.  Aren’t you guys trying to see who’s su perior and who’s inferior?

Quentin:  Women are catty and talk behind each other’s b acks.  We men make fun of each other in a good-natured way while we’re together.  That’s the difference: You women are laughing at  each other and we men are laughing with each other.

Lauren:  Oh yeah?  Was Tim laughing with  you guys when you threw him into the lake last weekend?

Quentin:  That was very funny, and yes, he thought it wa s funny, too.  What you women don’t understand is that we give as good as we get .  Next time, Tim will play a trick on someone else.

Lauren:  So it’s a vicious cycle of pranks.

Quentin:  Yeah, you could say that.  That’s how men bond .  That’s something you women don’t seem to understand.

Lauren:  We understand, all right.  You take turns to rturing each other and call it male bonding.

 Quentin:  See what I mean?  You women stick to your wa ys and we’ll stick to ours.

This episode is about how to make an appointment with yo ur doctor or some medical professional by calling them on the phone.  It’s going to give a lot of vocabulary related to hospitals and doctors and medical ap pointments.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I needed to make an appointment with a doctor so I cal led my health plan’s phone number for new patients.  Before I could schedule  my appointment, I had to listen to several recorded messages to be routed to the right medical office. The recording said to stay on the line for assistance.

Clerk:  Hello, Western Medical Group.

Damien:  Hello, I’d like to make an appointment with Dr. Gupta.

Clerk:  Are you a new patient or a returning patient?

Damien:  I’m a new patient.

Clerk:  Who referred you to Dr. Gupta?

Damien:  No one.  One of the health benefits of my pl an is that I can self-refer to some specialists.

Clerk:  What is the name of your plan and your medical r ecord number?

 Damien:  It’s Waiser and my medical record number is 234 56789.

Clerk:  It looks like Dr. Gupta is booked up for the next three weeks.  She has an opening on March 2nd, at 4:30 p.m.

Damien:  I was hoping to get an early morning appoint ment.

Clerk:  The next morning appointment won’t be until M arch 18th, at 11:00.  You’ll need to check in at 10:45 to fill out paperwork.  Shou ld I put you down for that?

Damien:  Is it possible to get an even earlier appointm ent?

Clerk:  Dr. Gupta doesn’t begin seeing patients until 1 0:30.

Damien:  10:30?  Isn’t that pretty late?

Clerk:  Dr. Gupta likes to play golf in the mornings.

Damien:  Why do you think I want an early morning appoi ntment?  Doesn’t she know that some of her patients prefer late-morning gol f?

[end of dialogue]

Our story begins with Damien saying, “I needed to make  an appointment with a doctor so I called my health plan’s phone number for new  patients.”  An “appointment” is a scheduled meeting, a specific day and t ime when you are going to do something.  Damien called his health plan’ s phone number for new patients.  A “health plan” is an insurance plan – a med ical insurance plan that helps pay for your medical expenses if you are sick.  “Patie nts” are people who receive medical treatment or medical advice from a doctor or a hospital.  If you’re a patient, that means that some doctor is looking after you – is taking care of you. Damien needed a medical appointment so he called his he alth plan – his insurance company’s number for new patients.  “Before I  could schedule an appointment,” he says, “I had to listen to several recorde d messages to be routed to the right medical office.”  “To be routed” (routed ) means to be sent to the right person or in the right direction.  In this case, if you’r e calling a large company you want to talk to the correct department.  “The recording  said to stay on the line for assistance.”  “To stay on the line” means not to hang up t he phone, to wait on the phone until someone answers; we also say “to hold.”  If yo u call a company, the person answering the phone, if they’re busy, may say “please  hold,” meaning I’m going to put the phone down, but don’t hang up – do n’t go away.

 Finally the clerk answers the phone by saying, “Hello, Weste rn Medical Group.” A “medical group” is a group of doctors who work togethe r in the same building, usually not a hospital.  It could be a medical office bui lding, or it could be a “clinic,” which is sort of like a small hospital.  Damien sa ys, “Hello, I’d like to make an appointment with Dr. Gupta.”  The clerk says, “are you a new patient or a returning patient (is this is the first time you’ve seen  or are going to see Dr. Gupta, or have you seen Dr. Gupta before)?”  “Returni ng,” here, means you’ve already used the services of this doctor – you’ve already s een this doctor before.

Damien says, “I’m a new patient,” and the clerk says, “Who referred you to Dr. Gupta?”  “To refer” (refer) means to recommend that someone see a particular person or a particular company; in this case, a particular or specific doctor. Someone says, “Oh, my neck really hurts,” and somebody else says,  “Oh, you should go see Dr. McQuillan, he is a very good neck doctor.”   I’m not sure if there are neck doctors; it’s just an example!  So Damien says, “No  one (meaning no one referred me to Dr. Gupta).  One of the health b enefits of my plan is that I can self-refer to some specialists.”  A “benefit” is a good th ing; a “health benefit” is something that you get from your health insurance; it’s something that is included in your insurance.  Damien says, “One of the health bene fits of my plan (meaning my insurance) is that I can self-refer to some specialists.”  “To self-refer” means to be able to request to see certain doctors without havi ng another doctor refer you, or another doctor approve that you can go see this pa rticular doctor. Usually, this has to do with doctors who are specialists.  A  “specialist” is an expert in a specific area of medicine.  So if you are a h and surgeon – you work on people’s hands – you are a specialist.  In many insurance  plans in the United States you can’t just go see any doctor you want to; first  you have to go see what’s called your “general practitioner,” or the doctor  who’s a general doctor, and if you have a specific problem that doctor will refer  you to a specialist.  There are some health plans where you can self-refer to certain  specialists.

The clerk says, “What is the name of your plan and your me dical record number?”  Your “medical record number,” sometimes call ed your “patient number,” is a number that the insurance plan gives you so that they can identify you.  It’s a number that only you have.  I don’t know wha t my medical record number is; it’s about eight or nine digits long – eigh t or nine numbers long. Damien says that the name of his plan (his health plan; his insurance) is Waiser and his medical record number is 23456789.  Boy, that’s a mazing how his medical record number are consecutive numbers between two  and nine!

Anyway, the clerk says, “It looks like Dr. Gupta is booked up for the next three weeks.”  “To be booked up” means to have a very busy, full  schedule; you don’t have any time to see anyone for any appointments.  The wo rd “book” has a

 number of different meanings however; take a look at o ur Learning Guide for some additional explanations.  The clerk says that Dr. Gupt a has an opening on March 2nd, at 4:30 p.m.  When we say “you have an opening,” we mean you have a period of time when you are available, when you can se e someone.  In this case, it’s a time that Dr. Gupta can see a new patient, such as Damien.

Damien says, “I was hoping to get an early morning appoi ntment.”  The clerk says, “The next morning appointment won’t be until March  18th, at 11:00.  You’ll need to check in at 10:45 to fill out paperwork.”  “To  check in” means to come to the office and talk to someone and let them know that yo u are here.  So basically it means you have to show up at 10:45; you have to be in the office at 10:45. Why so early if the appointment is not until 11:00?  Be cause, the clerk says, Damien has to fill out, or complete, some paperwork.  “Paperwork” are usually forms that you have to fill out, things that you need t o write down – information – on a sheet of paper.  We often use this term to indicat e not very interesting but necessary information.  The clerk asks, “Should I put you dow n for that?”  “To put (someone) down,” in this case, means to schedule someone for something by writing his or her name on a calendar or an appointme nt book.  To sign or to register someone for something means to put someone dow n.  If the clerks says, “I’ll put you down for 11:00,” she means I will schedule  you for 11:00; I will write your name down for 11:00.

Damien says, “Is it possible to get an even earlier appoi ntment (earlier in the day)?”  The clerk says, “Dr. Gupta doesn’t begin seeing pat ients until 10:30 (10:30 in the morning).”  Damien says, “10:30?  Isn’t that pretty late (isn’t that very late)?”  The clerk says, “Dr. Gupta likes to play golf i n the mornings.” Damien says, “Why do you think I want an early morning app ointment?  Doesn’t she know that some of her patients prefer late-morning golf?”  In other words, the joke here is that Dr. Gupta likes to play golf in the m orning so she cannot be there before 10:30; Damien is saying he likes to play go lf in the late morning, say 10:30-11:00, and that’s why he wants an early appointm ent.  The expression “to put down” also has a very different meaning; take a look at the Learning Guide for that other meaning.  There’s a standard joke that doctors have a lot of free time – a lot of extra time that they can use to do thin gs like play golf, which is, of course, a little bit expensive.  This is just a joke however ; most doctors, I don’t think, have very much time – at least, the majority of t hem.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

# Reviewing Job Applications

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 52: Reviewing Job Applications.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 552.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

The best way to improve your English is to listen to this episode and to look at the 8- to 10-page Learning Guide that we have on ou r website for episode, and all of our current episodes.  Go to eslpod.com, become a  member of ESL Podcast, and you can download those Learning Guides for e very current episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Missy and Jonathan.  Th ey’re talking about people who are “applying for work” at their company, p eople who are asking to be hired as employees.  It’s going to go over a lot of different vocabulary related to interviews and job applications.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Missy:  Okay, let’s sort this stack of applications into three p iles: good candidates, those worth a second look, and definite “no’ s.”

Jonathan:  Well, that didn’t take long.  With this poo r economy, I thought we’d get an embarrassment of riches, but these applications are pr etty pathetic.  I only see two of these people as employee material.

Missy:  Yeah, well, it might have something to do with the salary we’re offering. Not everybody is willing to work for peanuts.

Jonathan:  Isn’t that the truth!  Some of these applica nts have never held down a job before and don’t have a single reference.  These ot hers don’t seem to be able to hold on to a job, job-hopping every few mont hs.

Missy:  Well, at least we have these two standouts.  They b oth have the right educational background and level of experience.  Should w e call them in for interviews?

Jonathan:  Yeah, and I hope they haven’t already been snatched up by another company.

 Missy:  You and me, both.

[end of dialogue]

Missy says to Jonathan, “Okay, let’s sort this stack of application s into three piles.”  “Let’s sort (let’s organize) this stack (stack) of ap plications.”  A “stack” is a large number of objects that are placed on top of each  other so that you have, vertically, several things on top of each other.  We talk a bout a stack of papers; we could refer to a stack of plates in the kitchen, one on  top of the other.  Missy’s talking about a stack of applications.  An “application” i s the written information that someone who is trying to get a job at your company f ills out, or completes, and gives to you; it gives you their basic information.  Missy wants to sort the stack of applications into three piles (piles).  A “pile”  is a group of things that are in the same place, either next to each other or on top of each other, but not very organized.  A stack would probably be considered organized,  but a pile would be things that would not be very neat.  Maybe some things are “crooked,” some things aren’t exactly on top of the other things.  That would be a pile of things.  I should mention that “stack” has a couple of different me anings in English besides this one; take a look at your Learning Guide for some a dditional definitions.

So Missy wants to sort the applications into three piles: g ood candidates, those worth a second look, and definite “no’s.”  A “candidat e” is a person who wants to receive a particular position or get a particular job.  So, a job candidate would be somebody who wanted to work at your company.  A political candidate would be someone who wanted to have a certain political office: t he president, a senator, and so forth.  The expression “worth a second look” mean s that this person or this thing is good enough, has good enough qualities or  characteristics that you want to consider it a little more.  It may not be perf ect, but it’s good enough.  You say, “Okay, well, these are good candidates, definite ‘yes’ people.”  These are people who aren’t perfect, but we want to look at mo re closely again.  They’re worth a second look.

Jonathan says, “Well, that didn’t take long.  With this poor economy, I thought we’d get an embarrassment of riches, but these applicati ons are pretty pathetic.” The expression “an embarrassment of riches” means you have to o much of a good thing, or you have too many good things to choose from.  He’s saying here that he thought they would get lots of good applicati ons, too many for them to choose from, but instead they got applications that were  pathetic (pathetic). Something that is “pathetic” is very sad; in this case, very disappointing.  It’s not good enough.  “Pathetic” is a very strong, very negative way of describing something.  Jonathan says, “I only see two of these people  as employee material.”  The word “material,” here, means somethi ng that is used in a

 particular way for some particular purpose.  In this case,  these are people who might make good employees; they’re employee material.  “Material” has other meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some more detailed explanations of those.

Missy says, “Yeah, well, it might have something to do with  the salary we’re offering (the amount of money that we will pay this p erson).  Not everybody is willing to work for peanuts.”  The expression “to work for peanuts” means to work for very little pay, to work at a very low paying job.  M issy is saying here that the reason they didn’t get a lot of good applications is tha t people don’t want to work for such a low salary.

Jonathan says, “Isn’t that the truth (meaning I agree w ith you completely)!  Some of these applicants have never held down a job before.”  “To hold down a job” means to have and to keep a job for a long time, or at  least a reasonable amount of time – more than a week, let’s say.  My father once t old me that I could never hold down a job for more than two years, which is abou t right!  Jonathan says many of these applicants “don’t have a single reference.”   A “reference,” in this dialogue, means a person who is familiar with your work,  who knows you, and who is willing to give their opinion about you to the employer, to the person or the persons that are interviewing you.  For example, when I applied for a job at the university I needed to give them three references – three  is pretty common for U.S. jobs – and those could be my professors, they could be other people I worked with; they couldn’t be my wife or my mother.  You  don’t give your family members as references, although sometimes people will ask for a personal reference, and that will mean a friend who knows you ver y well.  But usually for a job you have professional references, people that you’ve wo rked with or worked for.

Jonathan says, “These other applicants don’t seem to be ab le to hold on to a job, job-hopping every few months.”  “To hold on to a job” is to keep a job; it’s similar to “hold down a job.”  “To hold on to (anything)” me ans to keep it for a long time; so “to hold on to a job” means to keep the job for a l ong time.  “To hop” (hop) usually means to jump up a short distance in the air wh ile you’re going forward. We talk about a rabbit, the animal, who hops.  They g o up and down in the air as they are moving forward, instead of walking for example.   Well, “job-hopping” means jumping – going from one job to another freque ntly; every few months or every year you have a new job.  That would be job-hoppin g.  “Bar-hopping” would be going to different bars to have different drinks.  This is called a “pub crawl” (crawl) in England, but in the United States w e usually talk about bar- hopping.  But we’re not bar-hopping in this dialogue , we’re talking about people who are job-hopping.

 Missy says, “Well, at least we have these two standouts.”  A “standout” (one word) is a person who is much better than everyone else, w ho’s obviously more qualified.  Missy says, “They both have the right educatio nal background,” meaning they have the right kind of education; they’ve st udied the right things for this job.  They also have the right level of experience; they’ve worked at this kind of job for a long time.  “Should we call them in for interviews?” meaning should we ask them to come to the office and meet with us forma lly so we can ask them questions in an interview.

Jonathan says, “Yeah, and I hope they haven’t already be en snatched up by another company.”  “To snatch (snatch) up” is a phrasal verb meaning to grab, to get or use something very quickly before other people can  get it or use it.  After Christmas, on December 26th, all the big shopping stores – the shopping malls have sales, where they lower the price on things.  And pe ople get there very early – I mean ridiculously early, 5:00 in the morning, 4:00 in the morning – so they can get the good prices, because they want to snatch u p all of the good things at low prices before other people get there and  take them, before they don’t have any more left.

So Jonathan is hoping that these two standouts have not b een snatched up – have not been already hired by another company.  Missy says, “You and me, both.”  “You and me, both” means that I completely a gree with you; I completely agree with what you said.  Notice grammatically it shoul d be “you and I,” but we don’t say “you and I”; the expression is “you and me, both .”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Missy:  Okay, let’s sort this stack of applications into three p iles: good candidates, those worth a second look, and definite “no’ s.”

Jonathan:  Well, that didn’t take long.  With this poo r economy, I thought we’d get an embarrassment of riches, but these applications are pr etty pathetic.  I only see two of these people as employee material.

Missy:  Yeah, well, it might have something to do with the salary we’re offering. Not everybody is willing to work for peanuts.

 Jonathan:  Isn’t that the truth!  Some of these applica nts have never held down a job before and don’t have a single reference.  These ot hers don’t seem to be able to hold on to a job, job-hopping every few mont hs.

Missy:  Well, at least we have these two standouts.  They b oth have the right educational background and level of experience.  Should w e call them in for interviews?

Jonathan:  Yeah, and I hope they haven’t already been snatched up by another company.

Missy:  You and me, both.

# A Homeowners¡¦ Association

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 53: A Homeowners’ Association.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 553.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is called “A Homeowners’ Association.”  It’s a  dialogue between Cuca and Emiliano using some information about being i n a situation, perhaps a difficult situation, when you are in an organization of  homeowners.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cuca:  What possessed you to agree to become the head of the homeowners’ association?

Emiliano:  I’m just tired of all of the waste and not  having a say.  Our dues keep going up and there seems to be special assessments every year.   I’m not even sure the association is following the bylaws anymore.  I ju st felt I had to step up.

Cuca:  That’s really admirable, but I hope you know what  you’re getting into. There’s been a lot of mismanagement, and you’ll have to  do battle with some entrenched members.  They’re not going to look kindly on the tough questions you’ll be asking.

Emiliano:  Believe me, I’m not looking forward to it,  but it’s got to be done.

Cuca:  Talk about a thankless job.

Emiliano:  Don’t I know it.  I guess I’m just a glutto n for punishment!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Cuca asking Emiliano, “What po ssessed you to agree to become the head of the homeowners’ association?”  The  expression “what

 possessed you to (do something)” is an informal phrase we use to ask why someone did something that seems strange, unexpected, even irrational or illogical.  We might also say, “Why on earth did you (do  something)?”  Cuca says, “What possessed you to agree to become the head (the lea der) of the homeowners’ association?”  A “homeowners’ association” is an  organization of people who all own houses or condominiums in a partic ular area, and this association enforces some certain rules that everyone has to follow on this property.  Homeowners’ associations also take care of what are called “common areas,” places everyone can use, such as a pool for example.

Cuca doesn’t seem to understand why Emiliano wanted to be head of the homeowners’ association.  Emiliano said, “I’m just tired  of all of the waste and not having a say.”  “Waste” is using too much of something, usi ng more of something than is necessary, especially when we’re talking about money or time or other resources.  Emiliano is tired of all the waste and “not having a say,” meaning not being able to give your opinion or your ideas.  This is e specially true when we’re talking about a group or an organization; you want eve ryone to have a say, meaning be able to participate, give their opinion.  Emiliano says, “Our dues keep going up.”  “Dues” (dues), as a noun, is money that you h ave to pay to an organization to belong to it.  “Due” (due) has several  different meanings in English however; take a look at the Learning Guide for those

Emiliano says, “There seems to be special assessments every yea r.”  An “assessment” is money that people in the organization – in  the homeowners’ association have to pay, usually in what we call a “one-t ime fee,” meaning you pay it once, but it’s not something you normally have to p ay.  So if the homeowners’ association was going to put in a brand new pool, it might have a special assessment to pay for the pool.  You would only pay it once; it wouldn’t be part of your regular yearly dues, that’s why we say it’ s a “special assessment.” Sometimes cities will make their homeowners (people wh o own homes in the city) pay a special assessment if they are, for example puttin g in new light poles or improving the roads.  There are special assessments that  property owners (people who own a home) have to pay.  Emiliano says, “I’ m not even sure the association is following the bylaws anymore.”  The “bylaws” (bylaws) are the official rules for an organization.  Usually when you crea te an organization, or a new business organization, you create bylaws that tell you what you’re going to do, how your company is organized, and so forth.  Someti mes the state will require you to have bylaws for your organization.  Emili ano says, “I just felt (I just thought or believed) I had to step up.”  The phrasal verb “to step up” means to volunteer or agree to do something, especially when nob ody else wants to do it because it’s unpleasant or it’s a difficult job.

 So, Emiliano wanted to step up; he wanted to voluntee r and do the difficult work. Cuca says, “That’s really admirable.”  Something that is “ admirable” is something that you can “admire,” that is, that you have a good im pression of, that you think is very good.  It’s admirable, Cuca says, that you are stepp ing up to be the head of the homeowners’ association, “but,” she says, “I hope yo u know what you’re getting into,” meaning I hope you understand what th is involves, what this requires you to do.  “There’s been a lot of mismanage ment, and you’ll have to do battle with some entrenched members.”  A couple of thi ngs there: “There’s been a lot of mismanagement.”  “Management” is running an  organization; “mismanagement” is doing a very bad job at running an o rganization or a business or a company.  Mismanagement – not doing it very w ell, not managing very well.  “To do battle” means to fight, to argue wi th, to be in opposition to something or someone, usually someone.  “I’m going to do  battle with my boss” means I’m going to have an argument with my boss; we’re  going to disagree with each other about something.

Cuca says Emiliano will have to do battle with some entre nched members. “Entrenched” means having a very strong opinion or positio n about something, especially if you’ve had that position or opinion for a l ong time and you don’t want to change it.  That would be an entrenched position.  So an “entrenched member” would be other people in the organization w ho will not want to change their mind.  Cuca says, “They’re not going to look kindly on the tough questions you’ll be asking.”  “To look kindly on” means to understa nd, appreciate, to think that it is good, to like something: “The girl looked kindly on the boys who opened the door for her so she could walk in.”  “People don’t look kindly on a government that is full of waste and mismanagement.”  In this case,  Cuca’s saying that these other members are not going to like the tough question s Emiliano will be asking. “Tough” means difficult or challenging; so “tough quest ions” would be things that may be difficult for the other person to answer, or pe rhaps embarrassing.

Emiliano says, “Believe me (meaning trust me), I’m not l ooking forward to it, but it’s got to be done (it has to be done).”  Cuca says, “Ta lk about a thankless job.” The phrase “talk about” is used to give emphasis on whate ver comes next; it’s used to show that this is a particularly good example of something else.  For example: “I went to see the new Star Trek  movie.  Talk about great science fiction!”  I’m saying that this movie is an example of gre at science fiction.  In the dialogue Cuca says, “Talk about a thankless job.”  “Thankle ss” is when nobody thanks you; so a “thankless job” is a job that is difficult but nobody appreciates it, nobody says “thank you.”  In this case, the thankless job is b eing head of the homeowners’ association, what Emiliano is doing.

 Emiliano says, “Don’t I know it.”  The phrase “don’t I kn ow it” is an informal way of saying that you agree with someone, with what someone  else has said, because you also have personal experience with it.  Emili ano is saying that he knows it’s a thankless job.  He says, “I guess I’m just a glut ton for punishment!” The expression “to be a glutton (glutton) for punishmen t” means that you are someone who likes to do things that have a negative conseq uence; something that you do even though you know it’s very difficult or ver y unpleasant.  The word “glutton” actually comes from “gluttony,” which is when yo u eat too much or drink too much; usually that’s what gluttony is.  So a glutton is somebody who normally eats too much or drinks too much.  But here, they’re “a g lutton for punishment,” meaning they get too much punishment; they somehow want to have this extra punishment.  It’s meant to be a joke, of course; althou gh I’m sure for Emiliano it was no joke!  Emiliano should have listened to Cuca, just as all husbands should listen to their wives – like I do!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cuca:  What possessed you to agree to become the head of the homeowners’ association?

Emiliano:  I’m just tired of all of the waste and not  having a say.  Our dues keep going up and there seems to be special assessments every year.   I’m not even sure the association is following the bylaws anymore.  I ju st felt I had to step up.

Cuca:  That’s really admirable, but I hope you know what  you’re getting into. There’s been a lot of mismanagement, and you’ll have to  do battle with some entrenched members.  They’re not going to look kindly on the tough questions you’ll be asking.

Emiliano:  Believe me, I’m not looking forward to it,  but it’s got to be done.

# An Emergency Airplane Landing

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 54: An Emergency Airplane Landing.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 554.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Please go to our website and support this podcast by becom ing a member or making a small donation.  You can do so at eslpod.com .

This episode is called “An Emergency Airplane Landing.”  A “landing” is when the plane comes down to the ground; an “emergency landing” would be when there’s some problem with the airplane.  Let’s get started. > I was nearly asleep in my seat when I heard this announce ment:
> “Folks, this is the captain speaking from the cockpit.  We a re experiencing a lot of turbulence and I’m turning on the fasten seatbelt sig n.  Please remain in your seats.”
> I didn’t think anything of it until a few minutes late r when I heard this announcement:
> “This is your captain speaking again.  Due to extreme weat her conditions, we may need to make an emergency landing.  The cabin crew w ill review the emergency procedures, and give you instructions on how to use  the floatation devices and the oxygen masks.  Please stay calm.”
> This is when I started to freak out.  What if we crash-l and?  What if we dive into the ocean?  Who would rescue us here in the middle of n owhere?
> Then, I heard this announcement:
> “Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain again.  It se ems that we had an instrument malfunction, and no emergency landing will b e necessary.  Sorry to alarm you, and please go back to sleep.”
> Our story begins when I say “I was nearly (meaning I was a lmost) asleep in my seat when I heard this announcement.”  Of course, we’re on an airplane in the middle of an airplane flight.  “Folks, this is the capta in speaking from the cockpit.” “Folks” is an informal way of saying “ladies and gentlemen ”; even more informal would be “guys” or “hey guys,” but a captain wouldn’t say t hat.  “Folks” is a little old-fashioned.  The word “folks” is also used to describe y our parents. Somebody says, “My folks are traveling,” they mean my parent s are traveling, but here it just means ladies and gentlemen.

“This is the captain speaking from the cockpit,” he says.  the “cockpit” (cockpit) is the part of the plane where the pilot and the assist ant pilot (we call him or her the “co-pilot”) sit, separated from the rest of the pla ne.  It’s in the very front of the plane, the cockpit.  The captain says that we are experienci ng (meaning we are having) a lot of turbulence.  “Turbulence” is when you h ave unpredictable movement in the airplane, usually because of wind or stor ms.  The airplane starts to move up and down or side to side.  It’s usually an unco mfortable situation.

The captain turns on the fasten seatbelt sign.  A “seatbe lt” is a belt that keeps you in your seat.  Most cars have seatbelts; you put the sea tbelt on before you start driving.  In fact, that’s the law in most places in the United States.  On an airplane, you also have a seatbelt that will, we hope,  prevent you from getting hurt if there is some sort of emergency situation or a lo t of turbulence, so you don’t fall out of your seat.  “To fasten a seatbelt” me ans to put it on.  “To fasten (something)” means to connect one thing with another.  A seatbelt has a metal end on it, and that fastens, or connects into the other  part of the seatbelt that is on the other side of the seat.  The “fasten seatbelt sig n” is a sign in the airplane that you can see usually above every seat that tells you whe ther you can get up and walk around, or whether you should remain in your se at with your seatbelts fastened.

The captain tells people to remain in their seats.  I say that I didn’t think anything of it (meaning I wasn’t thinking about it, it didn’t seem important) until a few minutes later when I heard another announcement.  The  captain comes on again: “This is your captain speaking again.  Due to extre me weather conditions, we may need to make an emergency landing.”  “Extreme wea ther conditions” would be a lot of rain, snow, or wind that might aff ect the way the plane flies.  An “emergency landing” is when the plane has to come down t o the ground, or

 perhaps the water, because there’s some problem with the airplane and it can’t continue flying.  “Landing” is when the plane comes back down to the ground. The opposite is called the “takeoff,” that’s when the pl ane goes up in the air.

Well, an emergency landing, of course, is a very serious th ing.  The captain says that the cabin crew will review emergency procedures.  A  “crew” is a group of people, in this case who are working together.  These are people who work for the airline; they are called, typically, “flight attenda nts,” and they work on the plane.  They give you your food, they provide informatio n and directions, and so forth.  The “cabin” is the part of the plane where the people are.  Usually in American airplanes, there is a big cabin, which is called  the “coach” cabin, that’s where the cheap seats are.  And then there’s the busine ss or first-class cabin in the front of the plane, where they have nice seats and good food.  The “cabin” refers, in general, to everything, all of the passenger s in the airplane.  So the “cabin crew” really means the flight attendants; in th is case, everyone but the pilots, who are in the front flying the plane.  “Proce dures” are steps; things that you have to do to.  “Emergency procedures” would be the things you have to do; in this case, if they had to make an emergency landing.

The captains says the cabin crew will give instructions on ho w to use the floatation devices and the oxygen masks.  “To float” (floa t) means to go into the water but not to go down below the water, you stay on top of the water.  A “floatation device” is something that you either wear o r hold onto that prevents your body from going underneath the water.  So if you  can’t swim, for example, but you have a floatation device, you can hang onto the  floatation device so that you don’t go down into the water and die.  The “oxygen  mask” is a small device you put over your mouth and your nose so that you can breat he oxygen in.  Of course, you need oxygen to survive, and when the plane is up  at a very high altitude, when it is high above the earth, you need th at oxygen given to you.  In an emergency situation you have oxygen masks, usually they are above where you are sitting.

The captain tells everyone to please stay calm, which, of c ourse, means don’t get excited, don’t panic, but that’s very difficult for peopl e to do in this situation.  I say that this is when I started to freak out.  “To freak (f reak) out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to become very worried or anxious o r scared.  It’s somewhat of an informal term.  Then I say, “What if we  crash-land?”  “To crash- land” means that the airplane has to go down either o n the ground or somewhere else, but not at the airport.  Of course, you don’t wa nt the plane to land somewhere else because many times the plane will blow up  – it will explode, and once again, you would die.  You see this is a happy, hap py story; I hope you’re not listening to this while you’re on the airplane!

 I say also, because I’m so worried, “What if we dive into  the ocean?”  “To dive” (dive) means to jump or to fall into the water from a bove, usually so that you are then completely underneath the water, at least for a period of time.  “Dive” has a couple of other in English, very different meanings; take  a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

So I am afraid that the plane is going to go down in to the ocean.  I then say, “Who would rescue us here in the middle of nowhere?”  “The middle of nowhere,” or “in the middle of nowhere,” means it’s a very remote  place, which means it isn’t near anything else.  There aren’t any cities, there  aren’t any towns, there aren’t a lot of people around; that would be in the  middle of nowhere.  “To rescue” means to find and save someone who’s in a difficult  situation.  So, there’ll be no one to rescue us if they crash-land or go into to the ocean because there is no one near them, they’re in the middle of n owhere.

Then, I hear the final announcement: “Ladies and gent lemen, this is the captain again.  It seems that we had an instrument malfunctio n.”  An “instrument” is a tool, in this case a tool that provides you information:  how high the plane is flying, how fast the plane is going.  These are pieces of infor mation that the instruments in the cockpit will indicate.  A “malfunction” is when som ething breaks, when it doesn’t work, when it stops working properly.  So the capt ain is saying that there isn’t an emergency, it was just a problem with their inst ruments.  The information was wrong; the machine was not working properly, it mal functioned.

He says, “Sorry to alarm you, and please go back to sleep.”  “To alarm (someone)” means to scare them or make them very worried,  usually by telling them some very bad news.  I, of course, am surprised at what the captain is saying.  He tells us to go back to sleep.  I then say, “Is h e kidding (is he joking)? How can anyone sleep after that?!”  You thought you wer e going to die one minute, the next minute everything is fine, but you’re st ill not able to just go back to sleep.  I say, “I’m still watching my life flash befor e my eyes!”  “To watch your life flash before your eyes” is an expression that means t hat you remember everything that happened in your life, but it goes by ver y quickly.  Usually, this is an expression that indicates that you are about to die.  For example, you’re in a car, and the car begins to go over the other side of the road, and another car is about to hit you.  One second, two seconds before you die , your life may flash before your eyes; you may suddenly think of all these thin gs that happened in your life.  In general, the expression is to indicate th at you were in a very dangerous situation.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal spe ed.

 [start of story]

I was nearly asleep in my seat when I heard this announce ment:

“Folks, this is your captain speaking from the cockpit.  We’r e experiencing a lot of turbulence and I’m turning on the fasten seatbelt sig n.  Please remain in your seats.”

I didn’t think anything of it until a few minutes late r when I heard this announcement:

“This is your captain speaking again.  Due to extreme weat her conditions, we may need to make an emergency landing.  The cabin crew w ill review the emergency procedures, and give you instructions on how to use  the floatation devices and the oxygen masks.  Please stay calm.”

This is when I started to freak out.  What if we crash-l and?  What if we dive into the ocean?  Who would rescue us here in the middle of n owhere?

Then, I heard this announcement:

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.  It se ems we had an instrument malfunction, and no emergency landing will b e necessary.  Sorry to alarm you, and please go back to sleep.”

Go back to sleep?!  Is he kidding?  How can anyone sleep a fter that?!  I’m still watching my life flash before my eyes!

# Lying and Telling the Truth

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 55: Lying and Telling the Truth.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 555.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You probably know that.  But did you know you can become a Learning Guide member and download Learning  Guides for all of our current episodes that will help you improve your English even faster?

This episode is a dialogue between Elizabeth and Leo.  It’s going to use a lot of vocabulary related to expressions of lying, or how we talk a bout telling the truth. Honestly!  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Elizabeth:  You’re full of it!

Leo:  I’m telling you the God’s honest truth.  Why woul d I eat the last piece of cake when I know that you had your heart set on it?

Elizabeth:  That’s the question, isn’t it?  Why would yo u go behind my back and eat it, and then try to put one over on me?

Leo:  Would I be able to look you in the eye if I wer e lying?  Look at me.  I’m the picture of Honest Abe.

Elizabeth:  Do you expect me to believe that?

Leo:  There’s not a dishonest bone in my body.  I may te ll a white lie here and there, but I would never try to tell you a bald-faced l ie like this.

Elizabeth:  Oh, really?  Do you swear?

Leo:  I swear that I didn’t eat the last piece of cake.

Elizabeth:  There’s something fishy about the way you said that.

Leo:  I don’t know what you mean.

 Elizabeth:  You didn’t eat the last piece of cake, but you know who did.

Leo:  I’m pleading the Fifth.

Elizabeth:  Spill it, Abe!

Leo:  Not on your life!

[end of dialogue]

Elizabeth begins by saying, “You’re full of it!”  To say someone is “full of it” means that they are lying, that they are not telling the truth.  It’s an informal expression, and a very strong expression.  You don’t want to say this to anyone that you work for or work with.  It’s a very strong expressio n.  It actually comes from a vulgar expression, which we won’t talk about, but  if you put an “sh” in front of the last word, you’ll know what I mean!

Leo says, “I’m telling you the God’s honest truth.”  The  expression “the God’s honest truth” means it is absolutely, completely true.  Yo u say this, or you could say this when someone thinks that you’re lying and you’re tr ying to convince them that you are telling the truth.  Leo says, “Why wou ld I eat the last piece of cake when I know that you had your heart set on it?”  S o, Elizabeth is mad because she thinks Leo ate the last piece of cake, probably in the refrigerator. Elizabeth had her heart set on it.  “To have your heart  set on (something)” means that you want it very much; you are planning on getting  it.  We’ll often use this expression when we don’t get what we were planning on getting.  For example, you go to your favorite Japanese restaurant and you wan t to get a certain kind of sushi, but when you get there they don’t have that sushi today and you’re disappointed.  You say, “I had my heart set on the spicy tu na roll,” or whatever it is.

So Leo asks Elizabeth why he would eat the last piece of c ake when he knew that Elizabeth had her heart set on it.  Elizabeth says, “That’s the question, isn’t it (meaning yes, why did you do that)?  Why would you go beh ind my back and eat it, and then try to put one over on me?”  “To go behi nd (someone’s) back” means to do something without telling the other person, to do something secretly, often something that will affect the other person or that t he other person probably did not want you to do.  So if your wife tells you that she does not want you to buy a new car, but one day when she is gone you go and you buy a  new car, you have gone behind her back.  And you are in big trouble budd y, let me tell you, if you did that!  “To put one over on (someone)” is a rather  complicated sounding

 expression.  It means to trick another person into thinking  something that isn’t true.  Basically, it’s to lie to the other person, to ge t them to think something that is false – that is not true: to put one over on someone .  “The students really put one over on their teacher, making her think that today was a holiday and there should be no school.”  Elizabeth is accusing – she’s saying to Leo that he’s lying.

Leo says, “Would I be able to look you in the eye if I we re lying?”  The expression “to look (someone) in the eye” means that you can look at someone and honestly tell them the truth.  The idea is that you can’t look someone in the eye – look directly at them and still tell a lie.  That’s not true , but many people, when they tell a lie, don’t look directly at the other person because th ey will indicate by the way they are looking at them that they are not telling the  truth, that they are lying. That’s the idea, I’m not sure if that’s true.  Leo says,  “Look at me.  I’m the picture of Honest Abe.”  “The picture of (something)” means I a m just like, I am identical with.  “Honest Abe” refers to Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States in the middle of the 19th century.  Abe Lincoln had the reputation for being very honest.  I’m not sure if that was true or not, but  in the U.S. there is this expression: “Honest Abe.”  Honest Abe is somebody who is very honest, who never lies.

So, Elizabeth is being told by Leo that he would never lie to her.  Elizabeth says, “Do you expect me to believe that?”  Leo says, “There’s no t a dishonest bone in my body.”  This phrase, “there’s not a dishonest bone in m y body,” means that I am not able to lie, it is not even possible for me to lie.  Leo continues, “I may tell a white lie here and there, but I would never try to tell you a bald-faced lie like this.”  A “white lie” means it’s a small, unimportant matter; it was a lie about something, but not something very important, not somethi ng serious.  Leo says, “I may tell a white lie here and there (meaning somet imes, occasionally), but I would never try to tell you a bald-faced lie.”  A “bald -faced lie” is a lie where you are almost not even trying to hide the fact that you are lying.  It’s a bold lie, often a lie about something that you know is completely wrong .  That would be a bald- faced lie.  “Bald” (bald) usually means someone without  hair.  “Bald-faced” would be someone who has no hair on their face, meaning they  don’t have a beard or a mustache.  The idea is that people with beards and musta ches might be dishonest; they’re trying to hide something.  I’ve always t hought this was true, actually.  Never trust a man in a beard!

Elizabeth says, “Oh, really?  Do you swear?”  Here, “to swe ar” (swear) means to promise that you are telling the truth, to say very stron gly that you are not lying. “Swear” has some other meanings in English very different  from this meaning. You can find those in our Learning Guide for this episo de.

 Leo says, “I swear that I didn’t eat the last piece of cake .”  “Elizabeth says, “There’s something fishy about the way you said that.”  W hen you say something is “fishy” (fishy) you mean there’s something strange, som ething dishonest, something wrong.  “There’s something fishy going on her e,” meaning there’s something wrong here.  Elizabeth says there’s something f ishy about the way that Leo said he didn’t eat the last piece of cake, me aning somehow, again, he’s lying.

Leo says, “I don’t know what you mean.”  Elizabeth says, “ You didn’t eat the last piece of cake, but you know who did (who did eat it).”  Leo says, “I’m pleading the Fifth.”  This expression means I’m not going to tell  you, I refuse to tell you that information because it could harm me.  This actual ly refers, in the U.S., to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the Unite d States, which says that no one can be “compelled,” meaning you can’t make someone say that they committed a crime, especially in a courtroom.  So, “to pl ead the Fifth” means that you have the right, if you will, to protect yourself by n ot saying that you did something wrong.

Elizabeth says to Leo, “Spill it, Abe!”  “Abe,” of course , referring back to Honest Abe.  “To spill (something)” in this case means to say some thing that should be a secret, to tell someone a secret.  “Spill” has other mea nings also.  Once again, take a look at the Learning Guide for those.

Finally, Leo says, “Not on your life!”  “Not on your li fe” is a phrase used to mean that something is not going to happen, even if you kill me I’m not going to tell you.  It can also mean absolutely not.  If someone asks me,  “Jeff, are you going to buy a cat today?” and I say, “Not on your life!”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Elizabeth:  You’re full of it!

Leo:  I’m telling you the God’s honest truth.  Why woul d I eat the last piece of cake when I know that you had your heart set on it?

Elizabeth:  That’s the question, isn’t it?  Why would yo u go behind my back and eat it, and then try to put one over on me?

Leo:  Would I be able to look you in the eye if I wer e lying?  Look at me.  I’m the picture of Honest Abe.

 Elizabeth:  Do you expect me to believe that?

Leo:  There’s not a dishonest bone in my body.  I may te ll a white lie here and there, but I would never try to tell you a bald-faced l ie like this.

Elizabeth:  Oh, really?  Do you swear?

Leo:  I swear that I didn’t eat the last piece of cake.

Elizabeth:  There’s something fishy about the way you said that.

Leo:  I don’t know what you mean.

Elizabeth:  You didn’t eat the last piece of cake, but you know who did.

Leo:  I’m pleading the Fifth.

Elizabeth:  Spill it, Abe!

Leo:  Not on your life!

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 56: Scheduling an Appointment.

This episode is called “Scheduling an Appointment.”  It’ s going to be a conversation between Ann and Serge about setting up a meeting – arranging a meeting between two people.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ann:  Hello.

Serge:  Hi, Ann.  It’s Serge.  I’m calling to make an  appointment for LeeAnn.  She wants to meet with Miles next week sometime.

Ann:  Let me take a look at his appointment schedule.  Let’s see, can LeeAnn be here on Tuesday at 2:00?

Serge:  No, she’s tied up all Tuesday afternoon, but I could shuffle around some of her commitments to free her up on Tuesday morning, i f that helps.

Ann:  Unfortunately, Tuesday morning is out.  I could b ump someone on Wednesday afternoon at 3:00.  Can LeeAnn be here at t hat time?

Serge:  She has an appointment at 2:30 in this office , but it shouldn’t last more than a half hour.  She should be able to make it by 3: 00 if she’s not running late. Better yet, I may be able to finagle something, maybe push back that appointment until she gets back to the office.  Why don ’t you pencil her in for now?

Ann:  Okay, I’ll do that, but can you confirm with me by Monday?

 Serge:  Sure, I’ll give you a heads up no later than noon on Monday if I can’t push back her other appointment.

Ann:  Okay, sounds good.  Tell me, do you ever feel like we’re spinning our wheels, spending our days making, changing, and canceling a ppointments?

Serge:  Yeah, every single day!

[end of dialogue]

Ann begins by saying, “Hello,” answering the phone.  Ser ge says, “Hi, Ann.  It’s Serge.  I’m calling to make an appointment for LeeAn n.”  “To make an appointment” is to schedule a time to do something, usua lly to meet with someone.  Serge says that LeeAnn wants to meet with Mil es next week sometime.  Ann says, “Let me take a look at his appointmen t schedule.”  Your “appointment schedule” is a calendar showing when you have  meetings.  Ann says, “Let’s see, can LeeAnn be here on Tuesday at 2:00?” meaning 2:00 in the afternoon.

Serge says, “No, she’s tied up all Tuesday afternoon.”  Wh en we say we are “tied up” we mean we are busy, we are not available.  “I mea nt to answer his email this afternoon, but then I got all tied up with othe r things.”  I was busy; I was occupied.  Serge says that he could shuffle around some of  LeeAnn’s commitments to free her up on Tuesday morning.  “To shuf fle around” is a phrasal verb meaning to move or change things, to reorga nize things in a different position, either physically (in space) or tempo rally (in time).  People often use this when talking about their schedule: “I’m g oing to shuffle around my schedule so that I can see you tomorrow morning.”  Serge says he can shuffle around some of LeeAnn’s commitments (some of her oblig ations; some of her other meetings, most likely) to free her up.  “To free (someone or something) up” means to make someone or something available; to change things so that they are no longer tied up; they’re no longer busy.  “Let m e see if I can free up some time to see you this afternoon,” let me see if I can move  some of my meetings so that we can talk this afternoon.

Serge is offering to free up LeeAnn on Tuesday morning .  Ann says, “Unfortunately, Tuesday morning is out.”  When we say som ething is “out,” we mean it’s not possible; it’s not an option; I cannot do it at that time or day.  So Tuesday morning is not possible, then Ann says, “I could bum p someone on Wednesday afternoon at 3:00.”  “To bump (bump) (someo ne)” means to change when something will happen so that something else can ha ppen.  For example: “My friend was supposed to sing at the performance, but sh e was bumped by

 another singer.”  They decided that they wanted someone else to sing.  We often use this expression when, for example, you are flying and t he airline sold too many tickets, which happens frequently.  They sold more ticke ts than they had seats for, and so they had to force some people to take a different plane.  You would say they were bumped.  That’s the meaning here, A nn is going to try to move someone on Wednesday afternoon.

Serge says that unfortunately LeeAnn has an appointment at 2:30 in this office, but it shouldn’t last more than a half hour.  “To last ,” as a verb, means to go on for a certain amount of time, not to end until a cert ain amount of time has passed. So for example someone might ask, “How long is this rain going to last?” meaning how long will it be raining.  You might say, “Well, until probably 5:00 this afternoon,” it will last until 5:00.  Both “bump” an d “last” have additional meanings in English; taking look at our Learning Guide for tho se explanations.

Serge says that LeeAnn should be able to make it (meani ng arrive to the meeting) by 3:00 if she’s not running late.  “To run l ate” means to be behind your schedule, to be doing things later than you had planne d because things took longer than expected.  If you tell someone you are goin g to meet them at a café at 8:00 and you see that you are not going to arrive o n time, you would want to call them, or text them, and tell them that you are ru nning late, that you will be there at whatever time you will be there, hopefully n ot too late.

So, Serge says that she should be there by 3:00 if she’s n ot running late.  “Better yet,” he says, “I may be able to finagle something.”  “B etter yet” is an expression used to introduce another idea or another solution tha t you thought of that would work better than the one you were talking about previou sly.  So I give you plan A, and then I think: “Oh, no.  Plan B is better.”  So I’ ll say, “Better yet, let’s do plan B.”  It’s always supposed to be a better idea.  “Better yet,” Serge says, “I may be able to finagle (finagle) something.”  “To finagle”  means to be, perhaps, very smart about something, very clever.  It could also mean th at you’re being tricky; you’re doing something that you would not normally do i n order to get what you want.  We use this somewhat informal verb in situations t hat are difficult, but we think we can, somehow, arrange it so that it will be possible.  Serge is going to try to finagle something, try to figure something out: “ma ybe push back that appointment until she gets back to the office.”  To “p ush back” an appointment or a meeting is to move it to a later time or even to a later day.  You were going to meet someone Tuesday, but then they were going to busy, so  they asked to push back the meeting until Friday – to change it to a later date or time.

Serge is suggesting that he push back LeeAnn’s appointment  – her 2:30 appointment, so that she can make a 3:00 meeting.  Serg e says, “Why don’t you

 pencil her in for now?”  This expression, “to pencil (pen cil) (someone) in,” means to write someone’s name on a calendar, showing when the y plan on meeting that person, but still waiting for final confirmation.  The  reason we say “pencil” is because a pencil is something you write with that you can erase if you make a mistake.  A pen, of course, cannot be easily erased – most p ens.  So that’s why we use the word “pencil,” and we actually make it a ver b: “to pencil (someone) in.”  It means to put their name down for a certain t ime, but knowing that you have to wait until the person says, “I can definitely do i t.”  So, it’s when you’re not definite, when you’re not certain about something.

Ann says, “Okay, I’ll do that (I’ll pencil her in), but ca n you confirm with me by Monday?”  “To confirm” is to verify that something is tr ue or correct.  So Serge is going to have to call Ann back sometime before Monday to  say definitely – certainly – yes or no, LeeAnn will be at the appointme nt.  Serge says, “Sure, I’ll give you a heads up no later than noon on Monday if I ca n’t push back her other appointment.”  “Heads up” means I’m giving you informa tion in advance. Sometimes “heads up” means a warning.  If you are out playing baseball and you throw a ball and it goes towards someone who doesn’t see  it coming, you would yell “Heads up!”  You’re warning them that they might get hit in the head with a baseball.  Well, it doesn’t always have to be related to  your head; it can be a warning about anything.  Or, it can be information a bout something that will happen in the future: “I’ll give you a heads up when I  am about to leave my office.”  That means I will call you or communicate with  you before I leave my office, or when I know what time I will be leaving my o ffice.

So, Serge is going to give Ann a heads up no later tha n Monday at noon.  Ann says, “Okay, sounds good.  Tell me, do you ever feel like we’ re spinning our wheels.”  “To spin your wheels” means to be involved in a lot of activities that keep you very busy, but that don’t accomplish very much; you don ’t seem to get very much done, but you are constantly busy.  That would be  spinning your wheels.  Serge says, “Yeah, every single day!” meaning, sim ply, every day. “Single” is just used to emphasize – to stress something h appens every day, without missing a single day.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ann:  Hello.

Serge:  Hi, Ann.  It’s Serge.  I’m calling to make an  appointment for LeeAnn.  She wants to meet with Miles next week sometime.

 Ann:  Let me take a look at his appointment schedule.  Let’s see, can LeeAnn be here on Tuesday at 2:00?

Better yet, I may be able to finagle something, maybe push back that appointment until she gets back to the office.  Why don ’t you pencil her in for now?

# Applying for a Passport

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 57: Applying for a Passport.

This episode is called “Applying for a Passport.”  It’s a d ialogue between Orlando and someone at the passport office.  It’s going to be usi ng a lot of vocabulary related to getting a passport, at least here in the U nited States.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Clerk:  Yes, can I help you?

Orlando:  I want to get a passport.

Clerk:  Have you filled out the application?

Orlando:  No, I haven’t.

Clerk:  Come back when you’ve filled it out.

Orlando:  Okay, I’ve completed the application.

Clerk:  Let me see it.  You need to fill in your Socia l Security number here and you need to provide evidence of your citizenship.  Have you ever had a passport before?

Orlando:  No, I haven’t.

Clerk:  In that case, you’ll need to submit a copy of your  birth certificate, or if you were born outside of the country, a copy of your Natural ization Certificate or a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

Orlando:  I don’t have those documents with me.

 Clerk:  Come back when you do.

Orlando:  Okay, I’m back.  I have a copy of my birth certif icate.

Clerk:  All right.  Let me see some identification.

Orlando:  Identification?

Clerk:  Yes, I need to see a valid driver’s license, a gover nment ID, or a military ID.

Orlando:  I’ll be right back.

Clerk:  Yes?

Orlando:  Here’s my military ID.

Clerk:  Where are you passport photos?

Orlando:  Passport photos?

Clerk:  Yes, you need two identical passport photos.

Orlando:  I’ll be right back.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with the clerk, the person who is wo rking at the passport office, saying to Orlando, “Yes, can I help you?”  “Can I  help you?” or “May I help you?” mean the same thing.  I should also point out tha t although you can get a passport by going to the U.S. government passport office,  most people get their passports at the Post Office; that’s where you submit your a pplication.

Orlando says, “I want to get a passport,” which you pro bably know is a small, official book that is given to you by your government that allows you to travel to other countries.  The clerk says, “Have you filled out (have you completed) the application (the form that requests all the informatio n about you)?”  Orlando says, “No, I haven’t.”  The clerk says, “Come back when you’ve fill ed it out (when you’ve completed it).”

 So Orlando goes away, he comes back, and he says, “Okay, I’ve co mpleted the application.”  The clerk says, “Let me see it,” please allo w me to look at it – the clerk isn’t actually that polite.  She says, “You need to f ill in (to write in) your Social Security number here.”  The “Social Security numbe r” is a number that pretty much everyone in the United States has, issued by the  government – the government gives you this number.  Usually you get the nu mber when you are a young child, or even a baby.  It identifies you.  It is a number that is typically only given to people who have legal permission to be here in  the United States. Social Security is also the name of a program that provid es money for those who need money to live on, especially those who are old.  It’ s sort of like our national retirement system – except they don’t have very much money!  T he Social Security number, then, is one thing that you have to put  on almost every official application that you fill out in the U.S.

The clerk tells Orlando he also needs evidence of his citi zenship.  “Evidence,” here, means the same as proof; evidence would be a writt en document that supports what you are saying.  In this case, Orlando is saying  “I am a U.S. citizen,” and the clerk is telling him he has to prove tha t – he has to show that. “Citizenship” means, of course, belonging to a particular  country.  Some people have dual citizenship; they are citizens of more than one co untry – two countries if it’s dual citizenship.  I suppose you could have citizenshi p in more than two countries, it would be a little unusual

Orlando is asked if he has ever had a passport before.  Passports in the United States are typically issued, or given to you, and they are good for 10 years; every 10 years you have to get a new passport.  Orlando says, “No , I haven’t (I haven’t had a passport before).”  The clerk says, “In that case (in  this situation), you’ll need to submit a copy of your birth certificate.”  “To  submit” (submit) means to officially give or send something to someone or to some o rganization, especially if that organization has to review or approve whatever i t is that you are sending in.  So for example, you could submit a job applicati on.  You could give the company an application, they would look at it and see if  they want to hire you – to have you work for them.  The word “submit” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some mo re explanations.

Well, the clerk is asking Orlando for his “birth certificat e.”  This is an official piece of paper that shows your complete name, when and where  you were born, who your parents are, and typically the name of the hospital,  although that isn’t always on the birth certificate.  Every state has its own bi rth certificate system; there is not a national birth certificate system in the U .S.  If I wanted to get my birth certificate I would have to go back, or write – no wadays email – the Minnesota government office that takes care of birth cert ificates.  Within a given

 state, mostly the birth certificates are arranged by county.   A “county” is a smaller division within state.  Minnesota, for example, has 87 co unties – 87 different regions.  In fact, it has more counties than any other st ate in the United States for some reason.  I would have to go back to the county I was born in, Ramsey County, which is where St. Paul is, and ask for a copy of m y birth certificate.

I actually did that when I was…I don’t know…12 years old m aybe, and we discovered – I discovered that my parents had not officially put a name in for me on the birth certificate.  They hadn’t decided what the y were going to call me. Remember, I’m the youngest of 11 children, so they had sort of gone through all of the names that they wanted.  Well, because they didn ’t know my name by the time my mother left the hospital, the birth certificate  simply said “Baby Boy McQuillan.”  I had to then officially prove to the count y that my legal name was Jeffrey – that’s my full name, and I had to provide them  evidence that I have used this name all of my life.  But for the first 12 yea rs of my existence on this earth I was officially known as Baby Boy McQuillan, which i s actually a good name since I was the youngest in the family, and we oft en call the youngest in the family the baby of the family – even if they’re 46  years old!  I’m still the baby of the family.

Back to Orlando: Orlando has to get a birth certificate , or if he was born outside of the United States he needs a copy of either his Natur alization Certificate or something called a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.  A “Naturalization Certificate” is an official piece of paper showing that you were once a citizen of another country, but then you became a U.S. citizen.  So if you move here after 20 years of living in, say, Japan or France or South Afr ica – wherever, and you want to become a U.S. citizen you have to get what is cal led “naturalized.”  You become a citizen, and that process is called “naturalizatio n.”  So, a “Naturalization Certificate” is a certificate proving tha t you officially became a U.S. citizen on this particular day; it’s not your birth ce rtificate.  If you have an American mother or father, or both, and you are born in another country you’re still an American citizen.  However, because you will not  have a birth certificate from a U.S. hospital you need to go to the local emba ssy or consulate and get a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.  An “embassy” is the m ain headquarters of representatives from your government in another country.  Usually the embassies are in the capital cities of the other countries;  here in the United States, they would be in Washington, D.C.  Many governme nts also have small offices called “consulates” that are in other cities in t he United States or in a different country.  So for example, here in Los Angel es there is a consulate for the government of Mexico, a consulate for China, a consul ate for Spain.  Dozens of other countries have consulates in big U.S. cities, especi ally cities that may have a lot of citizens from their country.  The U.S. has co nsulates in other cities,

 in addition to embassies, in other countries.  A “consular ,” then, refers to the notion of a representative; “consul,” here, is more gen erally a representative of your government.  Consular Report of Birth Aboad; “ab road” simply means in another country.  So it’s sort of like a birth certificat e but it comes from the U.S. State Department, from either an embassy or a consulate,  that shows that you are, in fact, an American citizen.

Well, Orlando says he doesn’t have any of these things.  He says, “I don’t have those documents (those official pieces of paper) with me. ”  A “document” can mean a couple of different things.  Once again, take a  look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.  So the clerk says to Orlando , “Come back when you do,” meaning come back here when you have one of thes e official documents.  So he goes, and comes back again and gives his birth certificate to the clerk.  The clerk then says, “Let me see some identificat ion (let me see something that proves that you are who you are).”  Usuall y that means either a valid driver’s license, a government ID, or a military ID .  A “driver’s license” is issued, or given, by each state, that says you have permission t o drive in that state, and in any other state, but you need at least on e driver’s license from one state.  A “valid” driver’s license just means a driver’s lice nse that is current, that was issued recently.  A “government ID” is identification that is given by the government, perhaps another government agency besides the state where you live.  A “military ID (or identification)” is a card tha t says you are a member of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, or the Marines, and that you work in that organization.

So Orlando has to leave again, he comes back, he says, “He re’s my military ID.” The clerk then asks, “Where are you passport photos?”  In o rder to get a passport you have to have two pictures taken of yourself, and you need to bring them and give them with your application to the governm ent representative in order to get a passport.  Passport photos are very small, a nd are just of your head.  Well of course, Orlando doesn’t have the passpor t photos.  The clerk says, “Yes, you’ll need two identical (or the same) photog raphs.”  Orlando says, “I’ll be right back,” and leaves again.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Clerk:  Yes, can I help you?

Orlando:  I want to get a passport.

 Clerk:  Have you filled out the application?

Orlando:  No, I haven’t.

Clerk:  Come back when you’ve filled it out.

Orlando:  Okay, I’ve completed the application.

Clerk:  Let me see it.  You need to fill in your Socia l Security number here and you need to provide evidence of your citizenship.  Have you ever had a passport before?

Orlando:  No, I haven’t.

Clerk:  In that case, you’ll need to submit a copy of your  birth certificate, or if you were born outside of the country, a copy of your Natural ization Certificate or a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

Orlando:  I don’t have those documents with me.

Clerk:  Come back when you do.

Orlando:  Okay, I’m back.  I have a copy of my birth certif icate.

Clerk:  All right.  Let me see some identification.

Orlando:  Identification?

Clerk:  Yes, I need to see a valid driver’s license, a gover nment ID, or a military ID.

Orlando:  I’ll be right back.

Clerk:  Yes?

Orlando:  Here’s my military ID.

Clerk:  Where are you passport photos?

Orlando:  Passport photos?

Clerk:  Yes, you need two identical passport photos.

 Orlando:  I’ll be right back.

This episode is called “Being a Strict Parent.”  It’s a d ialogue between Allison and Ola, and you’re going to learn about this particular parent and all of the rules that she wants her daughter to follow.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Allison:  I’m almost ready for my granddaughter’s visit.  She’ll be here tomorrow and I want everything to be perfect.

Ola:  What do you have planned?

Allison:  I’m going to spoil her rotten.  My daughter is very strict and doesn’t allow her to do anything that a normal 10-year-old wants to do.

Ola:  Like what?

Allison:  Well, her time is very structured and regimente d.  She’s never allowed any time for just frivolous fun.

Ola:  And you’re taking off the shackles.

Allison:  That’s right.  She can play as much as she wants t o for the next week.  I don’t want her to miss out on any experiences just because her mother is overprotective.  There will be no curfews and no time sche dules.

Ola:  Are you sure that’s a good idea?  I’m sure your daughter has instructions about how your granddaughter should behave and the pu nishments she should get if she misbehaves.

 Allison:  You’re right about that.  I’m expecting a lo ng list of rules for my granddaughter while she’s here, but she shouldn’t expect me to toe the line.  I’m the grandmother after all, so I have special privileges.   Nobody tells me what to do with my own granddaughter.

Ola:  How did a free spirit like you end up with a da ughter who is so uptight?

Allison:  Beats me.

Ola:  She’s not going to thank you for spoiling her da ughter, you know.

Allison:  I know, but I’m her  mother and there’s still a thing or two I can teach he r about raising a daughter!

[end of dialogue]

Allison begins our dialogue by saying, “I’m almost ready f or my granddaughter’s visit.”  Her “granddaughter” would, of course, be the daughter of either her son or daughter.  “She’ll be here tomorrow and I want everyt hing to be perfect.”  Ola says, “What do you have planned?”  Allison replies, “I’m g oing to spoil her rotten.”  “To spoil (spoil) (someone) rotten (rotten)”  means to do something nice for another person, especially a child, never doing anyth ing negative, never yelling at them, always doing nice things for them, givin g them whatever they want for example.  Most parents try not to “spoil their  children,” meaning they don’t want their children to get used to getting goo d things all the time, and then when they don’t get good things they don’t “behave,” or  they don’t act appropriately.  This expression actually can also refer to vegetables or fruit or meat, any type of food that after a few days will begi n to go bad so that you can’t eat it anymore.  When food spoils, we say that it has be come rotten.  That means it’s no longer something you can eat because it’s gone bad

Allison says, “I’m going to spoil my granddaughter rotten .  My daughter is very strict and doesn’t allow her to do anything that a normal 10-year-old wants to do.” “To be strict” means to insist that someone follow all of the rules, without making any exceptions.  You must do everything according to the rules.  So, a strict parent is someone who has a lot of rules for their chil dren, and expects them to follow all of these rules.

Ola says, “Like what?” meaning give me an example of one of these rules. Allison says, “Well, her time is very structured and regimen ted.”  To say something is “structured” means that it has a lot of org anization, it’s very

 organized, it can’t be changed.  We might say it’s “infl exible,” you can’t change it. “Structure” has a couple of different meanings in Engl ish however.  You can get the other meanings by going to our website and downloa ding the Learning Guide for this episode.  “Regimented” means with a definit e order, a definite discipline, almost like the military – almost like the army.  In fact,  the word “regiment” can also mean a group of soldiers.  Here, it simply means ve ry ordered, very disciplined, not changing.

Allison says her granddaughter is never allowed any time f or just frivolous fun. Something that is “frivolous” (frivolous) is something just  for fun, something that isn’t serious, something that has no important meaning.  Sometimes, “frivolous” can be a criticism, meaning someone isn’t very serious; the y don’t take anything seriously.  Here, it just means fun, just to have fun, no educational or other purposes for it.

Ola says, “And you’re taking off the shackles.”  “To take off ” is a phrasal verb meaning to remove.  “Shackles” are, literally, heavy pieces of metal that you put around someone in prison, on their arms and sometimes o n their legs.  So “shackles” would be something that would put on a priso ner – someone in jail. Here, the expression means to remove restrictions or limi tations.  “To take off the shackles” doesn’t mean that her granddaughter is actually w earing shackles – we hope not!  It means that the grandmother wants to rem ove these rules and strict regulations that her granddaughter has to follow fr om her mother.  This, of course, is what grandparents often do.  When they have th eir grandchildren over, they feel they can be as nice to them – not have to discipl ine them, because, after all, that’s the job of the parent.  I never kne w my grandmother, so I don’t know if that’s true.  They were dead by the time I was old enough to know who they were.

In this dialogue Allison says that she’s going to take off the shackles from her granddaughter.  She says, “She can play as much as she want s to for the next week.  I don’t want her to miss out on any experiences.”  “To miss out on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning not to be able t o enjoy or participate in something, to miss an opportunity.  “Don’t miss out on seeing the movie tomorrow.”  That means don’t miss the opportunity, when  you have it, to do that thing.  “Miss” is a verb that has several different meani ngs also.  You know where you can find those, in this episode’s Learning Guide.

Allison says she doesn’t want her granddaughter to miss out  on any experiences just because, or only because, her mother is overprotective.   Someone who is “protective” tries to keep someone else safe.  But to be  “overprotective” means that you’re trying to protect them so much that you are t aking away their

 legitimate freedom.  You’re not allowing them to li ve a normal life because you’re protecting them too much.  Sometimes parents can be overp rotective of their children; husbands may be overprotective of their wives.  I n this case, Allison is saying that the mother of her granddaughter – her dau ghter – is overprotective.

Allison says, “There will be no curfews or no time schedule s.”  A “curfew” (curfew) is the time when someone, usually a child or a young adult, must be home, and after which they cannot go outside again.  So me places have official curfews, saying that anyone who is less than 18 years old, for example, must be at home or with one of their parents.  Usually parents have curfews for their high school children, telling them they need to be home befo re, say, 11:00 at night, or 10:00 at night on days when there is school.  Those are cu rfews.  Governments sometimes, when there is a lot of violence in a particula r place, will have a curfew.  My parents never gave me a curfew.  I think they expected that I would behave myself and not get into trouble and be home at  a reasonable time.  I have, however, lived under one case of a curfew from the government.  In 1992, after the “riots,” the violent actions of some people af ter a certain court case had finished – the riots caused the police here to issue a cur few.  You could not be out on the street after the sun went down.  That laste d, I think, for about a week or so.  I wasn’t actually living in the City of Los Angel es at the time, so it didn’t affect me very much.  That’s quite unusual, however, for  the government to “impose,” or to tell people they have to “abide,” or f ollow, a curfew.

Well, Allison will have no curfews for her granddaughte r.  Ola says, “Are you sure that’s a good idea?  I’m sure your daughter has instructi ons about how your granddaughter should behave (should act) and the punish ments she should get if she misbehaves.”  A “punishment” is something you make someon e do if they’ve done something wrong.  If you commit a crime the govern ment will give you, for example, a punishment of going to prison for a year.  “ To misbehave” is the opposite of to behave; “to behave” means to act properly,  act appropriately.  “To misbehave” means to do things wrong.  We use this word in  talking about children: “The children are misbehaving.”  My neighbor’ s children are misbehaving every day, right outside my window!

Allison says, “You’re right about that (you’re right abo ut my daughter having these punishments).  I’m expecting a long list of rules f or my granddaughter while she’s here, but she shouldn’t expect me to toe (toe) the line.”  “To toe the line” means to follow the rules, to do what you are told to do.  Allison says, “I’m the grandmother after all, and I have special privileges (spe cial rights, special advantages because of who I am).”  In other words, gra ndmothers can do what they want with their grandchildren.  “Nobody tells me what to do with my own granddaughter.”

 Ola said, “How did a free spirit like you end up with a  daughter who is so uptight?”  A “free spirit” is someone who does whatever they want to do, who doesn’t follow the rules, who doesn’t care what other people think.  “Uptight” is the opposite.  “Uptight” (uptight – one word) means t o be very worried, anxious, not relaxed.  “Uptight” is really an insulting term, it ’s a negative way to describe someone.  Just because a parent has rules, doesn’t mean th ey’re uptight, but Ola uses the word to describe Allison’s daughter.

Allison answers his question, “Beats me.”  The expression “b eats (beats) me” is an informal one used to show that you don’t know the a nswer to something. Someone says, “What time is it?”  If you don’t know, you co uld say, “Beats me, I don’t know.”

Ola says that Allison’s daughter is not going to thank you for spoiling her daughter.  Allison says, “I know, but I’m her  mother and there’s still a thing or two I can teach her about raising a daughter!”  When somebo dy uses the expression “a thing or two,” they mean many things, especially when you’re talking about how much a person knows about something.  Someone says, “Do  you know about iTunes or podcasting?” and if you do, you could say, “I know a thing or two,” meaning you probably know a lot about it.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Allison:  I’m almost ready for my granddaughter’s visit.  She’ll be here tomorrow and I want everything to be perfect.

Ola:  What do you have planned?

Allison:  I’m going to spoil her rotten.  My daughter is very strict and doesn’t allow her to do anything that a normal 10-year-old wants to do.

Ola:  Like what?

Allison:  Well, her time is very structured and regimente d.  She’s never allowed any time for just frivolous fun.

Ola:  And you’re taking off the shackles.

 Allison:  That’s right.  She can play as much as she wants t o for the next week.  I don’t want her to miss out on any experiences just because her mother is overprotective.  There will be no curfews and no time sche dules.

Ola:  Are you sure that’s a good idea?  I’m sure your daughter has instructions about how your granddaughter should behave and the pu nishments she should get if she misbehaves.

Allison:  You’re right about that.  I’m expecting a lo ng list of rules for my granddaughter while she’s here, but she shouldn’t expect me to toe the line.  I’m the grandmother after all, so I have special privileges.   Nobody tells me what to do with my own granddaughter.

Ola:  How did a free spirit like you end up with a da ughter who is so uptight?

Allison:  Beats me.

Ola:  She’s not going to thank you for spoiling her da ughter, you know.

Allison:  I know, but I’m her  mother and there’s still a thing or two I can teach he r about raising a daughter!

This episode is called…uh…I forgot…oh yeah, “Being Forget ful.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Charlize:  You won’t forget that we’re going over to  the Wong’s for dinner tomorrow night, will you?

Pete:  It’s etched in my brain.  I won’t forget.

Charlize:  It slipped your mind last week that we were m eeting Donna at the movies, remember?

Pete:  I was preoccupied last week, but I won’t forget a bout tomorrow night.

Charlize:  I’m reminding you because the week before tha t, you forgot to cash that check at the bank.  Remember that?

Pete:  I didn’t forget.  I was just a little wrapped up in work that week.  I’m not usually absentminded, you know.

Charlize:  Right.  Do you want me to send you an email tomorrow morning to jog your memory?

Pete:  That won’t be necessary.  I have the day, time, an d even their address committed to memory.  Do you want to test me?

 Charlize:  No, I don’t, but I just want to make sure w e don’t have a repeat of what happened last month.  You were supposed to meet me at the Donnelly’s at 8:00 and you never showed up.  Remember that?

Pete:  No, I don’t.  I have amnesia.  I won’t remembe r any other incident you want to throw in my face.  I thought last week you said you would stop giving me a hard time about my bad memory.  Remember that?

Charlize:  Uh, no, I don’t.

Pete:  I guess I’m not the only one who’s scatterbrained !

[end of dialogue]

Charlize begins our dialogue – I think this is the fam ous actress Charlize Theron, I’m not sure – by saying, “You won’t forget that we’re  going over to the Wong’s for dinner tomorrow night, will you?”  “To forget” m eans not to remember something, to have no memory of something.  Charlize is using one of the many ways to ask a question in English, using something called a  “tag” question: “You won’t forget that we’re going over to the Wong’s for dinner tomorrow night, will you?”

Pete says, “It’s etched in my brain.”  Something that is “ etched (etched) in your brain” means that you have memorized it, you have permane ntly written it down in your mind so that you cannot possibly forget it.  Somet imes we use that expression for very happy things, sometimes for very sad thing s.  Pete says, “I won’t forget.”  Charlize responds, “It slipped your min d last week that we were meeting Donna at the movies, remember?”  “To slip (slip ) your mind” means to forget something, not to remember something: John said,  “I was supposed to get married this afternoon but it slipped my mind, just for got all about it!”

Pete says, “I was preoccupied last week, but I won’t forge t about tomorrow night.”  “To be preoccupied” means to be worried about  something else, to be thinking about something else; we might also say “to be distracted.”  Charlize says, “I’m reminding you because the week before that (mea ning two weeks ago), you forgot to cash that check at the bank.”  “To re mind (someone)” means to help someone remember something, to remember to do  something by telling them, perhaps over and over, or sending them an email:  don’t forget to do this. Charlize is reminding Pete because he forgot to cash a ch eck at the bank.  “To

 cash a check” means to go into a bank with a piece of pape r called a “check,” give it to the person working at the bank, and in exchang e they give you back money.

Charlize mentions how Pete forgot to cash this check two w eeks ago, and then asks him, “Remember that (do you remember)?”  Pete says, “I didn’t forget.  I was just a little wrapped up in work that week.”  “To b e wrapped (wrapped) up in (something)” means to be very busy with something, to b e very involved in a certain task – a certain thing that you are doing.  The word “wrap” has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some more information.  Pete says, “I’m not usually absentminded, you know.”  “To be absentminded” (one word) means to be forgetful, to b e easily distracted, not to be able to remember things.  There’s an old expression a bout the absentminded professor, the idea is that university professors are so busy w ith their intellectual tasks that they forget to do basic things like get their car  washed or buy food to make dinner.  That would be an absentminded professor.

Well, here Pete is saying that he is not absentminded.  Actually, he says, “I’m not usually absentminded, you know.”  Charlize says, “Right.”  She says, “Right,” which would normally mean I agree with you, but when yo u say it a certain way it means the opposite: I don’t believe you, I don’t agree  with you.  Often people will say, “Yeah, right,” that means I don’t believe you.  So  Charlize says, “Right,” she doesn’t believe him, then asks him, “Do you want me to sen d you an email tomorrow morning to jog (jog) your memory?”  “To jog  (someone’s) memory” means to remind someone of something, to help someone r emember something. If you are going out early tomorrow morning and you do n’t want to forget your lunch, you may put a little note on the door that says “b ring lunch.”  That note will jog your memory; it will remind you of what you are sup posed to do.

Charlize is offering to send Pete an email to jog his m emory about their dinner at the Wong’s tomorrow night.  Pete says, “That won’t be n ecessary (no, you do not need to do that).  I have the day, time, and even the ir address committed to memory.”  When we say something is “committed to memory,”  it’s similar to the previous expression “etched in my brain.”  It means you’ve me morized it, you know it so well you can repeat it without even looking a t it.  Most Americans have committed to memory, for example, certain patriotic son gs.  Because they’ve heard them so often, they know them, we would say, “by he art,” they have the memorized.  Pete then asks Charlize, “Do you want to test  me (do you want me to answer questions so that I can prove that I know)?”

 Charlize says, “No, I don’t, but I just want to make sure we don’t have a repeat of what happened last month.”  A “repeat of (something) ” is when something happens again, just like it did before.  We would also use the word “recurrence.” It “occurs,” or it happens, again.  Charlize says, “You w ere supposed to meet me at the Donnelly’s at 8:00 and you never showed up.”  Pe te was supposed to meet Charlize at the Donnelly’s.  Notice if we’re talking ab out someone’s house, especially a family in a house, we’ll often use the form  “the” and the name of the person with an “s” at the end: “We’re going over to t he McQuillan’s.”  We’re going over to the McQuillan house, the house that belongs to t he family named McQuillan.  There is an apostrophe before the “s,” so it  would be “McQuillan’ (apostrophe),” which is like a little comma, but up above  the word, and then the “s.”  It indicates possession; we’re really saying the McQuill an’s house.

Pete was supposed to show up, but didn’t.  He never show ed up.  “To show up” is a phrasal verb meaning to arrive at a particular pl ace at a particular time, to go somewhere when you are expected.  “My friend told me tha t we would meet at the café at 3:00, but I waited for an hour and she n ever showed up.”  “Show” has many different meanings, including other phrasal verbs.  You can get more information in this episode’s Learning Guide.

Charlize says, “Remember that?”  Pete says, “No, I don’t.  I have amnesia (amnesia).”  “Amnesia” is a medical condition where you c an’t remember what happened during a certain period of time.  Usually th is is because you were hit on the head or had a very frightening experience.  You might forget everything; you might even forget who you are and where you live.  T hat would be a serious case of amnesia.  Pete says, “I don’t remember because I h ave amnesia.”  He’s probably joking, of course.  He then says, “I won’t remem ber any other incident (any other event, anything else that happened) you want to throw in my face.”  “I won’t remember any other (any additional) incident you  want to throw in my face (or that you will throw in my face).”  “To throw (somet hing) in (someone’s) face” means to remind someone of something, especially if it’s something that the person wants to forget but you keep reminding them.  Us ually it’s something bad that happened or something that someone did wrong.  T hey made a mistake, and you keep throwing that mistake in their face; you kee p reminding them. That’s what Pete thinks Charlize is doing; he says, “I tho ught last week you (Charlize) said you would stop giving me a hard time ab out my bad memory.” “To give (someone) a hard time” means to do or say thing s that make the other person feel uncomfortable, to make a joke about them.  We would also used the verb, here, “to tease” (tease), to make jokes about somet hing that someone did wrong.

 Pete says, “Remember that (remember when you said you wer en’t going to give me a hard time)?”  Charlize says, “Uh, no, I don’t.”  Pete then says, “I guess I’m not the only one who’s scatterbrained!”  “To be scatterbr ained” is similar to “to be absentminded,” you’re unable to focus, you’re easily distr acted, you are constantly forgetting things.  That would be someone who  is scatterbrained.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Charlize:  You won’t forget that we’re going over to  the Wong’s for dinner tomorrow night, will you?

Pete:  It’s etched in my brain.  I won’t forget.

Charlize:  It slipped your mind last week that we were m eeting Donna at the movies, remember?

Pete:  I was preoccupied last week, but I won’t forget a bout tomorrow night.

Charlize:  I’m reminding you because the week before tha t, you forgot to cash that check at the bank.  Remember that?

This episode is called “Buying Fake Products.”  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Lindsay:  Look at this designer bag I bought.  It was such a steal!

Rafael:  Let me see that.  You do know that this is an imitation, not the real thing, right?

Lindsay:  What do you mean?  Of course it’s real.

Rafael:  Where did you buy it?

Lindsay:  Well, there was a guy on the street selling al l of these genuine designer bags.  He said he got them straight from the factory, an d that’s why he could sell them at such a markdown.

Rafael:  The reason he could sell it dirt cheap is because  this is a knockoff.  I know you’re a sucker for a bargain, but I can’t believe you  fell for his line.

Lindsay:  How do you know this is a knockoff?  Are you an expe rt on women’s handbags?  I still think this is real, and I’m sure I di dn’t get ripped off.

Rafael:  Whatever you say.  As they say, there’s a sucker bor n every minute!

 [end of dialogue]

Lindsay begins the dialogue by saying to Rafael, “Look a t this designer bag I bought.  It was such a steal!”  A “designer” bag or a “d esigner” anything is something that has a particular label or brand, especial ly in fashion.  When we’re talking about clothing if you said, “Well, that’s a desig ner dress made by Gucci,” that is a specific company – a specific “designer” (person wh o creates the piece of clothing, who designs the piece of clothing – the w ay it looks), and that would be a designer dress.  Well, this is a designer bag.  She says, “It was such a steal.”  “Steal” here means a bargain, something that you got at a very low price. “Steal” has a couple of other very different meanings ho wever; take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations of that word .

Rafael says, “Let me see that (give that to me so I can see  it).”  He says, “You do know that this is an imitation, not the real thing, ri ght?”  An “imitation” is a copy, a fake, something that is not original.  If you go to Ita ly you can often see Roman copies of Greek original statues.  Of course, the Romans h ad their own statues that were original, but many times they imitated the Greek statues.  Those statues are imitations; they’re not the original of the  statue.  Well, this is an imitation designer bag; it’s not the real thing.  The  expression “the real thing” means the original, not a copy, not a fake.

Lindsay says, “What do you mean?  Of course it’s real.”  S he thinks the bag she bought is, in fact, really the real thing.  Rafael says, “Where did you buy it?”  She says, “Well, there was a guy (a man) on the street selling  all of these genuine designer bags.”  So, Lindsay was walking down the street a nd saw a man selling bags that he said were genuine.  “Genuine” (genuine) means real, not fake, the same as “the real thing.”  The man said these were genu ine bags.  Well, of course, if you are walking down the street in a big city a nd someone is selling something to you like, for example, a bag made by Prada or some other designer, you probably should realize that these are not  usually genuine; they are, in fact, fakes.  They make it and then put the nam e on it, even though it isn’t the real thing.

Lindsay, however, apparently is not too smart; she says the man said he got them straight from the factory, and that’s why he could sell them at such a markdown.  “To get (something) straight from (something  or someone)” means directly from.  I once bought a new laptop computer onl ine, and I received the computer straight from China – straight from the factor y, the place where the computer was made in China.  It was sent to me interna tionally, directly to my

 house.  I got it straight from the factory.  Lindsay says t hat because this person got the bags straight from the factory he could sell the m at a markdown.  A “markdown” (one word) is a discount, something lower tha n the regular price.

Rafael says, “The reason (this man) could sell (the bags) dirt cheap is because this is a knockoff.”  The expression “dirt (dirt) cheap” mea ns very inexpensive, very cheap, at a very low cost.  “Dirt” is what you find o n the ground – it is the ground.  If you dig down in a garden or dig in the f ront of your house you will have dirt.  That’s the black stuff, typically, unless you li ve in the North Pole, in which case there is no dirt.  But if you live in the Nort h Pole, you probably can’t buy designer bags up there!  Anyway, “dirt cheap” means ve ry cheap.  The reason he can sell the bags dirt cheap is because they are knockoffs.  A “knockoff” (knockoff – one word) is a copy, an imitation; it’s another word for a fake.  We usually use the term when we are talking about  a physical object.  You could also have, for example, a fake excuse or a fake reaso n for doing something.  But if you use the word “knockoff,” you’re ref erring to an actual physical item, something that someone is selling that the y say is original – is genuine, but isn’t.

Rafael says, “I know you’re a sucker for a bargain, but I can’t believe you fell for his line.”  A couple of expressions there: first “to be a sucker for (something)” means to be a person who likes something very much, and be cause they like it so much they can be easily fooled – easily tricked into thin king that you’re getting this thing, even though it isn’t real, even though normal people would not necessarily think it’s real.  “To be a sucker for” can also mean you like something very much, or when you are presented with this thing you c an’t resist.  For example, I’m a sucker for new technology.  If there’s some  new thing out there – new device, I need to have it.  I want to have it; I’m a sucker for those sorts of things.  Lindsay is a sucker for a bargain.  A “bargain” is same as a “steal,” it’s a very good price on something.  Rafael says he can’t believe Lindsay fell for the man’s line.  “To fall for (something)” means to be foo led by someone, or to be tricked by something.  Men often fall for women who are  beautiful and smile at them and laugh at their jokes.  Here, “to fall for” w ould mean to fall in love, but generally it means to be tricked.  I’m not saying that f alling in love is the same as being fooled, though wise men say only fools fall in love .  I think I should write a song about that!  Anyway, Rafael says that Lindsay fell for this man’s line.  The word “line” here means something that someone said to yo u usually to trick you, to fool you, to get you to believe something that isn’t true.  “Line” has lots of different meanings in English however; look at the Learning Guide for some more explanations.

 So Lindsay says, “How do you know this (bag) is a knockoff?  are you an expert on women’s handbags?  I think this is real, and I’m sure I didn’t get ripped off.” “To get ripped (ripped) off” means to get cheated, to  have lost money because you were tricked or fooled.  Rafael says, “Whatever you sa y.”  This is an informal phrase used when you don’t believe what the other perso n is saying, but you do not want to continue arguing or fighting about it.  He says, “As they say, there’s a sucker born every minute!”  “As they say” is a way of saying th is is a common expression, this is a common saying.  And there is a common expression, a common saying in English “there’s a sucker born every minute .”  A “sucker” is someone who is easily fooled – is easily tricked.  “There’s a  sucker born every minute” means there are lots of people who are suckers – who are easily tricked. This expression is usually “attributed to,” people usually say it was first said by, the person who founded, or started, one of the first  circuses in the United States, a man by the name of P.T. Barnum.  A “circus” is a perf ormance where you have animals and people doing interesting tricks.  P.T. Barnu m’s circus is still around in the United States; you can still go see it.  Now it ’s called Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey’s Circus.  I used to see it every year when  I was a child.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Lindsay:  Look at this designer bag I bought.  It was such a steal!

Rafael:  Let me see that.  You do know that this is an imitation, not the real thing, right?

Lindsay:  What do you mean?  Of course it’s real.

Rafael:  Where did you buy it?

Lindsay:  Well, there was a guy on the street selling al l of these genuine designer bags.  He said he got them straight from the factory, an d that’s why he could sell them at such a markdown.

Rafael:  The reason he could sell it dirt cheap is because  this is a knockoff.  I know you’re a sucker for a bargain, but I can’t believe you  fell for his line.

 Lindsay:  How do you know this is a knockoff?  Are you an expe rt on women’s handbags?  I still think this is real, and I’m sure I di dn’t get ripped off.

Rafael:  Whatever you say.  As they say, there’s a sucker bor n every minute!

# Reducing Household Expenses

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 63: Reducing Household Expenses.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 563.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will give you all of the vocabulary, defin itions, sample sentences, additional definitions, cultural notes, comprehension qu estions, and, most importantly, a complete transcript of everything we say on  this episode.

This episode is a dialogue between Roland and Ginger a bout “household expenses,” the money that you have to spend to live in a h ouse or apartment. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Roland:  If we want to save enough money to buy a hous e, we need to get serious about our finances and do some financial plannin g.  I think the first step is to create a household budget.

Ginger:  Okay by me.  You know that I’m all about the bottom line.

Roland:  Yeah, right.  I think we have a pretty good i dea of our spending patterns, so it shouldn’t be too hard to come up with a budget t hat we can both live with.

Ginger:  Right.

Roland:  Okay, one thing we need to keep in mind is th at we tend to underestimate our monthly expenses.  If you look at our d iscretionary spending on this spreadsheet I created, you’ll be surprised at ho w much money we spend on nonessentials.

Ginger:  Okay, I can cut back on nonessentials.

Roland:  You can?

 Ginger:  Sure, instead of getting my nails done every we ek, I’ll get them done only three times a month.

Roland:  Well, that’s a start…

Ginger:  And instead of buying a new 60-inch TV, we can  get a 52-inch one instead.  That should save us a lot of money.

Roland:  I think you need to do the math.  If we don’ t cut back much more drastically, we’ll be ready for retirement by the time w e can afford a house!

[end of dialogue]

Roland begins by saying to Ginger, “If we want to save en ough money to buy a house, we need to get serious about our finances and do some financial planning.”  Roland and Ginger want to buy a house; t hey need to save their money, so they need to “get serious about,” or focus on, be concentrated on, and actually do things related to their finances.  Your “fin ances” are how you manage your money, the way you save and spend, the amount of mo ney that you save and spend.  “Financial planning” is the process of sittin g down and thinking about your future and the money that you will need.  When you  retire, how much money you will have to live on?  If your child is going to go  to college, how much money will you need to send them there?  The answer is a lot !

Well, Roland says that he thinks the “first step,” the fir st thing they should do, is create a household budget.  “Household” refers to everyon e who lives in your house, apartment, or condominium: the father, the mot her, the children, maybe grandma, maybe grandpa, and so forth.  A “budget” i s a plan about how much you are going to spend for different things – how much are we going to spend for food, how much are we going to spend for gasoline for  our car, and so forth.

Ginger says, “Okay by me (meaning yes, I agree).  You know that I’m all about the bottom line.”  The expression “to be all about (som ething)” means to be very interested in something, very involved, perhaps, in somethi ng.  I’m all about the Dodger baseball team; I love to watch the Dodgers her e in Los Angeles.  Ginger is all about the bottom line.  The “bottom line” ref ers to the amount of money that you have at the end of a certain period – how much did you spend, how much did you save.  Did you spend more than you saved, or did you sa ve more than you spent?  I should mention that “about” as a preposition  is used with a lot of

 different verbs and idioms (phrasal verbs); take a look a t the Learning Guide for some more information about that one.

Roland says, “Yeah, right.  I think we have a pretty goo d idea of our spending patterns.”  Your “spending patterns” are the ways in wh ich you spend money.  A “pattern” is something that happens usually repeatedly ove r time.  You always spend about this much money every month on food, this much money on cable television, this much money on Starbucks coffee, and so fort h.  Roland says, “it shouldn’t be too hard (too difficult) to come up wit h (to write down) a budget that we can both live with (that we both agree to follow). ”  Ginger says, “Right,” meaning I agree.

Roland says, “Okay, one thing we need to keep in mind (me aning one thing we need to remember) is that we tend to underestimate o ur monthly expenses.” “We tend to” means we usually “underestimate.”  “To e stimate” means to guess approximately how much of something that you need or wa nt.  “To underestimate” means to guess or believe that something i s smaller, or less, or perhaps less important than it actually is.  So if you say,  “Oh, I estimate I spend 10 dollars a month on gasoline,” and you actually spend 100 dollars a month on gasoline, well, then you are underestimating.  The opp osite would be, of course, “to overestimate,” to guess too high rather than too lo w.  Roland says that he and Ginger underestimate their monthly expenses.  “Expense” is money that is spent on something.  The money that you give to other people for something, that’s an expense.

Roland says, “If you look at our discretionary spending on t his spreadsheet I created, you’ll be surprised at how much money we spend o n nonessentials.” “Discretionary” means optional, something you have a choice about, something you could do or not do.  “Discretionary spending” is mone y that you don’t have to spend; money that you could save or spend, depending on you r decision.  A “spreadsheet” is an electronic document, usually created b y a program such as Excel or Lotus or other software, that’s used to store num bers and to make calculations about things – numerical things.  So, what R oland has done is made a spreadsheet on the computer of how much they spend, and he says they spend a lot of money on nonessentials.  Something that i s “essential” is something you must have.  Food and water are essentials for human life. “Nonessentials” are things you don’t need.  A 56-inch f lat screen television is a nonessential; human beings can actually live without one.   I know that’s hard to believe for some of you!  Computers are really essential for many people in their jobs and businesses; they’re not nonessential, at least they’ re not for me.

 Ginger says, “Okay, I can cut back (I can spend less) on nonessen tials.”  Roland says, somewhat surprised, “You can?”  Ginger says, “Sure, inst ead of getting my nails done every week, I’ll get them done only three ti mes a month.”  “To get your nails done” is to go to a place where they shape and p aint your fingernails and toenails, something that women usually do – and some rock stars!  What Ginger is saying is that instead of going every week to get her n ails done, she’ll only go three times a month, not four times a month.  Roland  says, “Well, that’s a start (that’s a beginning).”  Ginger then says, “And instead of buying a new 60-inch TV (that is, a television where the screen is 60 inches measur ing diagonally, from one corner to the other, opposite corner), we can get a  52-inch one instead.  That should save us a lot of money.”  Of course, these are not  very important sacrifices; you’re not going to save a lot of money doing t hese sorts of things.

Roland says, “I think you need to do the math.”  When som eone says “do the math,” they mean look at the numbers, calculate, add and  subtract, figure out exactly what the numbers are.  “Do the math.”  “Math” i s short for mathematics. Here, it means really do the calculations.  “If we don’t  cut back much more drastically, we’ll be ready for retirement by the time w e can afford a house!”  “To cut back,” as I mentioned earlier, means to reduce, to de crease the amount of something.  The verb “cut” has several meanings in English;  “to cut back” is a phrasal verb, but there are other ways of using this verb that are explained in the Learning Guide.  Roland says that they have to cut back dra stically.  “Drastically” means in a big way, a lot.  If they do not, they’ll be ready for retirement by the time they can afford a house.  “Retirement” is when you quit your job, usually after you’re 55-60-65 years old, and you don’t work anymo re.  In the United States, it’s typical around the age of 65, though some p eople retire earlier and some later.  “To afford” means to be able to pay for so mething.  Roland is saying that they won’t be able to buy a house for many, many yea rs unless they cut back much more drastically.

Now we’ll listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Roland:  If we want to save enough money to buy a hous e, we need to get serious about our finances and do some financial plannin g.  I think the first step is to create a household budget.

Ginger:  Okay by me.  You know that I’m all about the bottom line.

# Working in a Laboratory

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 64: Working in a Laboratory.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 564.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode to help you improve your English even faster.  Yo u can also take a look at our other ESL courses on the website.

This episode is called “Working in a Laboratory.”  It’s a dialogue between Tony and Gale using vocabulary you would find in a scientific la boratory.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I was working in the lab, as usual, when my colleague br ought his three-year-old son into work. …

Tony:  Hi, Gale.  This is my son, Philippe.  There was a problem with his daycare today, so he’ll be spending the day here with me.  I’ll  teach him all about doing research.

Gale:  I’m not sure this is a good place for a toddler .  Should he be playing with the microscope like that?

Tony:  Oh, he’ll be fine.  I’ll just keep the beakers and test tubes out of his reach and he’ll be all right.

Gale:  Whoa, he almost tipped over that tray of Petri  dishes.  I’m using those for the experiment I’m running, and there are some pretty dangerous chemicals in them.

Tony:  Good thing you saw him before he could do any rea l damage.  I think he just wants to help, right?  You just want to collect som e data for Gale, right?

6

Gale:  Don’t look now but he’s emptying those solutions into the pockets of your lab coat.

Tony:  Oh, you silly goose!  You’re just trying to make wor k more fun and interesting for us, aren’t you?

[end of dialogue]

The title of this dialogue is “Working in a Laboratory, ” the word is spelled (laboratory); most people pronounce it “ lab-ratory ,” as if there were no “o” in the middle.  You will hear some people say “ laboratory .”  There is also a different pronunciation that you can definitely hear the “o” in: “la-bo-ratory ,” but that’s not a very common one, at least an American English.  A laborat ory is a place where scientists and others do experiments.  Most Americans who ha ve gone through high school, at least many of them, have taken chemistry classe s, and chemistry classes in an American high school are usually held – they usually take place in a laboratory, or least a room that has things you would  find in a laboratory to do experiments with.

This story begins with the woman, Gale, saying that she wa s working in the lab – “lab” is just a short form for a laboratory – as usual, w hen my colleague brought his three-year-old son into work.  Your “colleague” is you r coworker, a person with whom you work, usually at the same business or organiza tion but not always.

Tony, her colleague, says, “Hi, Gale.  This is my son, Phili ppe.  There was a problem with his daycare today, so he’ll be spending the day here with me.” “Daycare”  (daycare – one word) is a type of business that takes care of young children for parents who need to work; they have to put their children somewhere.  This is more common when the woman, especiall y, has to work – the mother, but it could be for either the mother or  the father.  If there are two parents in the family and they are both working, the chi ldren who are too young to go to school, under six years old for example, would need to be placed typically in some sort of daycare, literally care during the day, during the time they are working.

Poor Tony had a problem with his daycare, and so he decid ed instead of staying home with his son, he brought him into work.  Tony says h e’s going to teach his son all about doing research.  “Research” is the process of  learning new information.  In a laboratory it would involve doing experiments, typically.  Gale says, “I’m not sure this is a good place for a toddler.”  Normally, laboratories have

7

dangerous chemicals or dangerous things for young children.   So Gale says, “I’m not sure (meaning I think) this is a good place for a to ddler.”  Notice although she says, “I’m not sure,” that’s just a polite way of saying thi s is my opinion.  A “toddler” is a one-, two-, or three-year-old child, usu ally a child who is learning to walk; we call them a toddler (toddler).

Gale says, “Should he be playing with the microscope like t hat?”  A “microscope” is a device used to see things that are very, very small, tha t you can’t normally see just with your eyes.  It’s often used in biological rese arch, but also other types of research.  Tony says, “Oh, he’ll be fine.”  He do esn’t think it’s a problem that his young son is playing with this microscope.  He says, “I’ll just keep the beakers and test tubes out of his reach and he’ll be all right.”  A “beaker” (beaker) is a glass cup that has small markings in it for measuring.   It’s used especially in chemistry, when you are pouring or putting liquids into something smaller; the beaker has the liquid material inside of it.  A “test t ube” (two words) is a small glass container; it is round, like a tube.  Usually, it is rounded at one end, so it’s open at one end and it’s closed at the other, and you p our things into it, chemicals for example, when you are doing your experimen ts.  When I was in high school, our chemistry teacher was called “Beaker” by the  students.  Well, we didn’t say that to her, we said it to each other sort of  as a joke.

Tony says that he’s going to keep the beakers and test tub es out of his son’s reach.  “Reach” here would be the area around you that  you can touch by putting out your hand.  “Out of reach” means that it is too far  away from you.  So, if I’m sitting at one end of a table and the newspaper is fo ur feet away, it is out of reach; I cannot reach it, I cannot touch it.  Of course , I could just get up and walk over and get it, but I’m too lazy!

Tony says that he’ll be all right – he’ll be okay, his son.   Gale says, “Whoa, he almost tipped over that tray of Petri dishes.”  “Whoa,” spelled (whoa), is an expression that we use when something is falling, or som ething is about to go wrong, or something is surprising.  Gale says that Philip pe, the young toddler, almost tipped over something.  “To tip over (something) ” or “to tip (something) over” is a phrasal verb that means to knock something over;  to hit something, usually accidentally, and make it fall over.  For example: “I hit the glass of milk accidentally, I tipped it over and all the milk came out  of it.”  Actually, that used to happen to me all the time when I was a child.  My moth er was very careful about giving me too much milk because I would always tip over the  glass – by mistake, of course!  On farms in Minnesota, where there are anim als, the high school students like to tip over cows that are sleeping – complete ly different idea!

8

Gale says that Philippe almost tipped over a tray – a gro up of, in this case, Petri dishes.  A “Petri dish” is a small, very short, round gl ass or plastic dish that has a top on it that scientists use for certain kinds of research.   Gale says that “I’m using those (those Petri dishes) for an experiment I’m running (I’m doing), and there are some pretty dangerous chemicals in them.”  An “experiment” is a scientific test of something to see whether you are right  about your ideas.  Gale is “running,” conducting or doing, an experiment, and t here are some dangerous chemicals involved.  A “chemical” is a liquid or a gas used i n chemistry for some experimental reason, or for some other reason; chemicals are used in many different things.

Tony says, “Good thing you saw him before he could do any r eal damage,” meaning it is fortunate – it is lucky you saw him and stop ped him from doing any “damage,” any harm.  “I think he just wants to help, r ight?”  He then talks to his son and says, “You just want to collect some data for Gal e, right?”  “To collect” means to gather, to get something, some information, o r physical thing together in one place.  “Collect” has a couple of different mean ings in English, as does the word “tip” that we talked about earlier.  Take a loo k at the Learning Guide for both of these words, and some additional explanations of  them.

Gale is collecting “data” (data), which is information,  facts.  Technically, the word “data” is plural; the singular is “datum,” but most peo ple use “data” nowadays for both singular and plural.  Gale says, “Don’t look now bu t he’s emptying those solutions into the pockets of your lab coat.”  “Don’t lo ok now” means you should look; “don’t look now” means there is something surprising  that is going on – that is happening.  In this case, the young Philippe is emptyin g solutions into the pockets of his father’s lab coat.  “To empty” means to remo ve the contents of something so there is nothing left inside.  When you com e home from your trip, you empty your luggage; you empty your suitcase, you take e verything out of it. A “solution” is a chemical term, usually it’s a liquid tha t is a mixture of two different other liquids.  A “lab coat” is a special piece  of clothing, usually white, that is worn by scientists who are working in a laboratory,  like the one in our dialogue.

Tony says, “Oh, you silly goose!” again talking to his young so n.  The expression “silly goose” is something you would say to a young child wh o has done something funny that has made you laugh.  A “goose” is, you probably know, a kind of animal, it’s a bird; but “silly goose” is a term we use with children to say they’ve done something funny, not something dangerous.  T ony obviously doesn’t understand how dangerous it is for his son in the laboratory.  He says, “You’re just trying to make work more fun and interestin g for us, aren’t you?”  He

9

thinks that Philippe is funny.  Gale thinks the young Ph ilippe is dangerous, or at least should not be in the laboratory.  This is what hap pens sometimes when you take your children to work.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue at a normal speed.

I was working in the lab, as usual, when my colleague br ought his three-year-old son into work. …

# Dating a Friend¡¦s Ex

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 65: Dating a Friend’s Ex.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 565.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Visit our website at eslpod.com.  Download this episode’ s Learning Guide, an 8- to 10-page guide we provide for all of our current e pisodes that gives you some additional help in improving your English.

This episode is called “Dating a Friend’s Ex (ex).”  The t erm “ex” can refer to your former boyfriend, your former girlfriend; it could also  refer to your former husband or wife.  Sounds interesting, let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Fareed:  Where are you going?

Amber:  I’m going to meet Peter.

Fareed:  When are you going to tell Lily?

Amber:  Tell her what?

Fareed:  You know what – that you’re dating her ex.  S he’s not going to take it well.

Amber:  I don’t know why she would object.  They broke u p over a year ago and they’ve both moved on.

Fareed:  Peter has moved on, but Lily still has a thing  for him.  You know that as well as I do.

Amber:  She never said that he was off-limits.  It’s not  like we’re sneaking around behind her back.

 Fareed:  Aren’t you?  She’s one of your best friends a nd you haven’t clued her in on the two of you yet.  If you don’t tell her soon, wh en she finds out, all hell is going to break loose.

Amber:  That’s not fair.  If there were a statute of limitations on ex-boyfriends, then we’re well past that.  He’s fair game.

Fareed:  That’s not how she’s going to see it.  If you a sk me, you have two options: break it off with Peter or tell Lily now, bef ore she finds out from someone else.  Tell her the truth and let the chips fall wher e they may.

Amber:  That’s easy for you to say.  You’re not facing Li ly’s wrath.  I think I’ll keep this under wraps for now, thank you very much.

Fareed:  Fine, but it’s your funeral.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Fareed saying to Amber, “Wher e are you going?” Amber says, “I’m going to meet Peter.”  Fareed says, “Whe n are you going to tell Lily?”  Lily’s a girl – a woman.  Amber says, “Tell her w hat?”  Fareed says, “You know what (you know what I am talking about) – that you’ re dating her ex.”  So to review, Fareed, the man, is a friend with Amber, the woman in the dialogue. Amber is dating – is going on a romantic evening or aft ernoon with Peter.  Peter used be the boyfriend of Lily, another women, who is no t in the dialogue.  So, we would say Amber is dating Lily’s ex.  Here, I think, her e x-boyfriend – her previous or former boyfriend.

Fareed says that Lily is not going to take it well.  “To take (something) well” means to handle or manage a negative situation calmly, p ositively, without getting angry or upset.  Usually when you tell someone bad news, if they say, “Oh, okay,” they may be very disappointed but they don’t sh ow it – they take it well.  Well, Fareed says that Lily is not going to take t he news that Amber is dating her ex well.  Amber says, “I don’t know why (Lily) would object,” there’s no reason for her to object.  “To object” means to oppose so mething, to do or say something that shows that you don’t agree with this, tha t you think it’s a bad idea. The word “object” has a couple of different meanings in  English however; make sure you look at the Learning Guide for some additional  explanations of that word.

 Amber says, “I don’t know why she would object.  They (mea ning Lily and Peter) broke up over a year ago and they’ve both moved on.”  “To  break up” in this dialogue means to end a romantic relationship.  You’re  boyfriend and girlfriend for a year – six months, and then she says to you, “I don’t  love you anymore,” or “I found someone who’s better looking and makes more mon ey, and I am leaving you.  I’m going to break up with you.”  I think that’s w hich she said to me, I’m not sure, something like that!  Well, Amber is saying that Pe ter and Lily broke up over a year ago, a long time ago, and that they’ve both  moved on.  “To move on” is a phrasal verb meaning that you’ve stopped thinking a bout something in the past and you are living your normal life again.  If your  girlfriend leaves you, you may be very upset for a week or two weeks, or a month or t wo months, but eventually you have to move on.  You have to get over it, forget about it; find another fish in the sea, as we say.  The word “move” has m any different meanings in English; please take a look at our Learning Guide, again, for more explanations.

Fareed says to Amber, “Peter has moved on (Peter is no l onger thinking about his ex-girlfriend Lily), but Lily still has a thing for h im (for Peter).”  The expression “to have a thing for (someone)” means that you are rom antically attracted to that person.  You’re interested in that person romantically:  “He has a thing for his boss’s daughter.”  Probably not a good idea – unless, of course, you want to take over the company, and then you should probably pursue tha t – go ahead with that!  Lily still has a thing for Peter, and Fareed says,  “You know that as well as I do.”  He’s saying to Amber you already know that Lily has n ot moved on.

Amber says, “She (Lily) never said that he (Peter) was off -limits.”  “To be off- limits” means to be not allowed, prohibited, forbidde n.  It could be a thing, it could be a place that is off-limits; you cannot go there.  Amb er says, “It’s not like we’re sneaking around behind her back.”  “It’s not like” means i t is not the case, or it is not true that we’re sneaking around behind her back.  “ To sneak (sneak) around behind (someone’s) back” – notice it’s “around” and “be hind” together – “to sneak around behind (someone’s) back” means to do something wit hout another person knowing, to hide what you are doing, to try not to let someone know what you are doing.

So, they’re not sneaking around behind Lily’s back.  Faree d says, “Aren’t you? She’s one of your best friends and you haven’t clued her  in on the two of you yet.”  “To clue (someone) in” is a phrasal verb meaning to give someone a little bit of information about something, to tell someone w hat is happening.  Fareed is saying that Amber has not told Lily that she, Amber, is d ating Lily’s ex-boyfriend Peter – she hasn’t clued her in.  He says, “If you don’t  tell her soon, when she

 finds out, all hell is going to break loose.”  So, if A mber does not tell Lily about her dating Peter, Fareed is saying that when Lily finds out on her own all hell is going to break loose.  The phrase “all hell is going to  break loose” is an informal one.  The word “hell” is usually not used in formal or polite conversation, unless you are talking about the place hell, where in the Chr istian religion you go if you have been bad in this life.  But as a general rule, w e don’t say “hell” in polite conversation.  So this is an informal phrase; it’s used to mean that there will be a major or very big problem, and people are going to ge t very angry, very upset when this thing happens.  “All hell is going to break l oose” means once people find out they’re going to be angry, they’re going to b e mad, they’re going to do something about it.

Amber says, “That’s not fair (that’s not just or right).  If there were a statute of limitations on ex-boyfriends, then we’re well past that.   He’s fair game.”  A “statute of limitations” is a legal term – an official  term that describes the maximum amount of time during which you can take some leg al action.  For example, if you steal someone’s car and the police do no t find you – do not catch you, they have only a certain number of years to find you.   If after, let’s say, five years they don’t find you, there may be a statute – which is another word for a law – a statute of limitations that says after five years,  if the police don’t catch you and don’t try to put you in jail, then they cannot  try to catch you and put you in jail after it.  You are basically free.  Here, Ambe r is using the expression to mean that there isn’t a time limit on when you can da te someone’s ex-boyfriend, and if there were – if one did exist – it has been a l ong time and therefore we are well past that; we are past the time when I have to wa it before I can date this ex- boyfriend.  “He’s fair game.”  “Fair game” means that something is allowed; something can be had or used by anyone, not just one per son.  When you say something is “fair game” you mean anybody can take it; in  this case, anybody can date Peter.

Fareed says, “That’s not how (Lily’s) going to see it.  If  you ask me (if you ask my advice), you have two options (two things you can do): brea k it off with Peter or tell Lily now, before she finds out from someone else.”  “To break (something) off” is a phrasal verb meaning to end a relationship o r to end an agreement that you have with someone else.  In this case, Fareed is saying  either Amber should break up with Peter or she should tell Lily about it no w.  “Tell her the truth,” Fareed says, “and let the chips fall where they may.”  T his is a common expression: “to let the chips (chips) fall where they may. ”  This means to accept the consequences, the results of your actions; to see what h appens especially when the results – the consequences may be negative.  Thi s expression comes from card playing like they do in Las Vegas.  When you are betting money –

 when you are putting your money down saying that you’re going to win, for example, a game of poker.  The “chips” are round, usual ly plastic, colored disks that represent money.  So you don’t actually put a hundr ed dollars on the table in Las Vegas if you are gambling, you would have a chip tha t would be worth a hundred dollars – would be a symbol for the 100 dollar s.  But the expression is used generally, “let the chips fall where they may,” to mean that you have to accept the consequences of your actions, even though they are negative.

Amber says, “That’s easy for you to say.  You’re not facing L ily’s wrath.”  “Wrath” (wrath) is anger, someone who is very upset.  She’s saying t hat Lily will be very upset when she tells her.  Amber says, “I think I’ll keep  this under wraps for now, thank you very much.”  “Thank you very much” means I don’t want your opinion, or I am not going to follow your advice.  “To keep (som ething) under wraps” (wraps) means to keep something secret, not to let anyone  else know about it: “I’m going to keep this under wraps.”  Usually it’s a bad  idea to have secrets, especially with your friends, girlfriends, wives, and so for th.  It’s a very bad idea; trust me when I tell you!

Fareed says, “Fine (okay), but it’s your funeral.”  A “fun eral” is a ceremony you have when someone dies; to remember them you all get to gether and you have this funeral, this sort of meeting where you remember the person who died.  The expression “it’s your funeral” is an informal one meaning  that you think the other person’s actions are going to cause a lot of problems, no t necessarily death, but you’re not going to interfere with their decision.  Wh en someone says “it’s your funeral,” they’re saying to you something bad is going to  happen to you but it’s none of my business, I’m not going to interfere, I’m n ot going to try to stop you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Fareed:  Where are you going?

Amber:  I’m going to meet Peter.

Fareed:  When are you going to tell Lily?

Amber:  Tell her what?

Fareed:  You know what – that you’re dating her ex.  S he’s not going to take it well.

 Amber:  I don’t know why she would object.  They broke u p over a year ago and they’ve both moved on.

Fareed:  Peter has moved on, but Lily still has a thing  for him.  You know that as well as I do.

Amber:  She never said that he was off-limits.  It’s not  like we’re sneaking around behind her back.

Fareed:  Aren’t you?  She’s one of your best friends a nd you haven’t clued her in on the two of you yet.  If you don’t tell her soon, wh en she finds out, all hell is going to break loose.

Amber:  That’s not fair.  If there were a statute of limitations on ex-boyfriends, then we’re well past that.  He’s fair game.

Fareed:  That’s not how she’s going to see it.  If you a sk me, you have two options: break it off with Peter or tell Lily now, bef ore she finds out from someone else.  Tell her the truth and let the chips fall wher e they may.

Amber:  That’s easy for you to say.  You’re not facing Li ly’s wrath.  I think I’ll keep this under wraps for now, thank you very much.

Fareed:  Fine, but it’s your funeral.

[end of dialogue]

I don’t think anyone will object if I thank the writer of the script for this episode, Dr. Lucy Tse.  Thank you, Lucy.





# Having a Wild Party

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 66: Having a Wild Party.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 566.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can go there to download  a Learning Guide for this episode that includes, well, everything you need to improve your English.

This episode is called “Having a Wild Party.”  It’s a dia logue between Paula and Mitch about someone who’s having a party that’s a little too crazy.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Paula:  Okay, let’s get this party started!

Mitch:  I really don’t think having a party is such a good  idea.  We’re supposed to be house-sitting, and I’m sure the Abrams wouldn’t wan t their house used for a big blowout.

Paula:  Ignorance is bliss.  They’ll never know.  Stop bei ng such a goody two- shoes and help me set up.

Mitch:  What if something gets broken or damaged?  Thi ngs usually get out of hand when people start pounding back a few.

Paula:  What do you think I’m doing?  I’m moving the  breakables to the other room.  Nothing will happen.

Mitch:  How can you say that?  At Kyle’s party last month,  two guys got into it and ended up trashing his parents’ house!

Paula:  That’s because they didn’t have Babbit.

Mitch:  What’s a Babbit?

 Paula:  Babbit is the name of an old high school frie nd of mine and he’s tough as nails.  He’ll be here to bust heads and to keep everybody in line.  Trust me. Nothing bad will happen with Babbit playing bouncer.  Where are you going?

Mitch:  I’m getting out while I can.  This is a disaster  waiting to happen.

Paula:  You’re not staying for the party?  You’re leavi ng?

Mitch:  Wouldn’t you, if you were on the Titanic?

[end of dialogue]

We begin with Paula saying to Mitch, “Okay, let’s get th is party started!”  Let’s start our party – our celebration.  Mitch says, “I really don’t think having a party is such a good idea.”  It’s not a good idea, Mitch thinks.  “We’re supposed to be house-sitting, and I’m sure the Abrams wouldn’t want th eir house used for a big blowout.”  “To house-sit” means to take care of someone’s home – someone’s house when that person is gone, perhaps because they’re t raveling.  You might stay at their house or apartment; you might just go over  every day or every week to check to make sure the house is okay, check the mail for exam ple.  A “blowout” is a big party, it’s something where you have m any people and a lot of noise; it’s a loud party.  Usually, we think about this a djective, “blowout,” when we’re talking about a party perhaps for college student s who are drinking and yelling.  That would be an example of a blowout.  Th ere are several words in English that use “out.”  “Blowout” is what we call a co mpound word; it’s the word “blow” plus the word “out” together as one word.  For  more examples of this take a look at our Learning Guide for this episode.

So Mitch says that he and Paula are house-sitting, are wa tching this house for perhaps friends or family, the Abrams family, and that they would not want a big party in their house.  Paula uses next an expression that i s common: “Ignorance is bliss” (bliss).  “To be ignorant” means not to know some thing.  “Bliss” is an old word for being very happy.  The expression “ignorance is b liss” means that sometimes it’s better not to know.  If you know, then you’ ll feel worse; but if you don’t know, well then, it’s not a problem.  For exampl e, someone says to you, “Do you know how many calories are in this doughnut?”  I f you eat too many doughnuts you’ll get fat.  Too many calories will make yo u fat – just ask the average American!  That’s an example of a place where yo u could use this expression.  Someone says, “Do you know how many calories are in this doughnut?” and you say, “Ignorance is bliss,” meaning I d on’t want to know, I’m happier if I don’t know.

 Paula says that the Abrams will never know, they’ll never find out – unless they’re listening to this podcast!  She says, “Stop being su ch a goody two-shoes and help me set up.”  The expression “a goody (goody) tw o-shoes,” that’s “two (two) -shoes,” like what you put on your feet.  I’m not  sure the origin, where the expression comes from, but “goody two-shoes” is a person wh o always does what he or she is supposed to.  It’s really sort of an insu lting, negative term; you’re saying that this person is always perfect.  The idea  is that maybe they’re a little boring or maybe that they don’t like to have fun  because they never do anything wrong.  Paula wants Mitch to help her set up.   “To set up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to organize and prepare an event: to put the tables up, to put the chairs by the tables, and so forth.

However, Mitch is worried, he says, “What if something g ets broken or damaged?  Things (meaning the situation) usually get o ut of hand when people start pounding back a few.”  “To get out of hand” mean s to get out of control.  If a teachers says, “My class is getting out of hand,” she means t he class is getting wild, it’s getting loud, she can’t control it.  Mitch says that this situation will get out of hand – will become uncontrollable when people start  pounding a few back. The expression “to pound (pound) back a few,” or “to pou nd a few back,” means to be drinking many alcoholic beverages: one beer, one gl ass of wine, then another beer, then another beer.  When you’re drinkin g then quickly, we would say that you are pounding a few back.  It means to drink a  lot of alcohol quickly.

Paula says, “What do you think I’m doing?  I’m moving the  breakables to the other room.  Nothing will happen.”  Something that is “breakable” is something that is able to be broken, something that can break easil y.  They are many words in English that use this “able” (able) at the end, for  example: “This is doable.” That means you can do it, it is able to be done.  So, so mething that is “breakable,” is something that you can break.  Paula is moving all of the breakables into another room, where the party will n ot be.  She tells Mitch, “Nothing will happen,” nothing bad will happen.

Mitch says, “How can you say that (that’s not possible)?  At K yle’s party last month, two guys got into it and ended up trashing his parents’ house!”  When you say two people “got into it” you mean they had a fight or an argument; often it means that they are hitting each other.  Well, at a p arty last month two guys (two men; two boys) got into it (had a fight) and ended up  (as a result of their fight) trashing his parents’ house.  “To trash,” here, means to  destroy or to break something, or to make something very dirty and disorgani zed.  If the house is full of dirt, and there are things that are broken, and th ere is glass, for example, on

 the floor, we might say that someone trashed the house.  In this case, it was the two guys who were fighting.

Paula says, “That’s because they didn’t have Babbit.”  The  party did not have Babbit.  Mitch says, “What’s a Babbit?”  Paula explains, “Babbit is the name of an old high school friend of mine and he’s tough as nails.”   The expression “to be tough as nails” means to be very strong; you can’t hurt t his person.  Usually it’s a big person, a very strong person.  “Nails” are little pie ces of metal we use to put into wood, usually to connect or put something on the wood.  You could also use nails on your wall to put up a picture.  Paula says that  her old friend, Babbit, is as tough as nails.  “He’ll be here to bust heads and to keep everybody in line.”  “To bust heads” means to hurt another person with physical fo rce.  So, Babbit is going to make sure there are no fights; he’s going to ke ep everybody in line.  “To keep everybody or everyone in line” means to do something  so that everyone behaves, no one does anything badly.  A good teacher has to keep her students in line, make sure they aren’t doing anything crazy.  As your teacher, I hope you’re not doing anything crazy while you’re listening to  this episode!  Paula says, “Trust me.  Nothing bad will happen with Babbit p laying bouncer.”  A “bouncer” is a strong person, usually a man, who works at  a bar or at a party.  He makes sure that no one causes any problems, no one gets into  a fight.  “To play bouncer” means, in this case, to work as a bouncer.

Paula then says to Mitch, “Where are you going?”  Mitch sa ys, “I’m getting out (meaning I’m leaving) while I can (while I am able to ).  This is a disaster waiting to happen.”  The expression “a disaster (a horrible th ing; a bad thing) waiting to happen” means that you know something very bad is going to happen because what you are doing is a bad idea.  A young child in the  kitchen while you are cooking is a disaster waiting to happen; something bad is going to happen because the situation is dangerous.

Paula says, “You’re not staying for the party?  You’re le aving?”  Mitch says, “Wouldn’t you, if you were on the Titanic?”  The “Tita nic,” you may know, was a British ship that sank in 1912; it went down into the water and killed more than 1,500 people.  Nowadays, we often use it in English as an example of a horrible disaster – a huge disaster.  Or maybe we say that because it  was a terrible movie, I’m not sure!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Paula:  Okay, let’s get this party started!

Mitch:  I really don’t think having a party is such a good  idea.  We’re supposed to be house-sitting, and I’m sure the Abrams wouldn’t wan t their house used for a big blowout.

Paula:  Ignorance is bliss.  They’ll never know.  Stop bei ng such a goody two- shoes and help me set up.

Mitch:  What if something gets broken or damaged?  Thi ngs usually get out of hand when people start pounding back a few.

Paula:  What do you think I’m doing?  I’m moving the  breakables to the other room.  Nothing will happen.

Mitch:  How can you say that?  At Kyle’s party last month,  two guys got into it and ended up trashing his parents’ house!

Paula:  That’s because they didn’t have Babbit.

Mitch:  What’s a Babbit?

Paula:  Babbit is the name of an old high school frie nd of mine and he’s tough as nails.  He’ll be here to bust heads and to keep everybody in line.  Trust me. Nothing bad will happen with Babbit playing bouncer.  Where are you going?

Mitch:  I’m getting out while I can.  This is a disaster  waiting to happen.

Paula:  You’re not staying for the party?  You’re leavi ng?

Mitch:  Wouldn’t you, if you were on the Titanic?

[end of dialogue]

The script for this episode was written by Dr. Lucy Tse.  What would happen if I started writing scripts, you may ask.  That would be a disa ster waiting to happen!





# Visiting a Patient in the Hospital

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 67: Visiting a Patient in the Hospital.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 567.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

If you like this podcast and would like to support us you can  become a member of ESL Podcast by going to our website, eslpod.com (com).   You can also make a donation to or podcast to keep this audio portion fr ee for everyone.

This episode is about someone visiting a hospital.  It uses vocabulary that you would need in a hospital.  I hope you don’t need it, but if you do, here it is.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

George:  You’re just in time.  There’s only another 20  minutes until the end of visiting hours.

Inez:  I got here as soon as I could.  How is Uncle Peter?

George:  They moved him from the emergency ward to the intensive care unit. He’s on life support.

Inez:  How could this have happened?  How could somebody in the prime of his life collapse suddenly like that?

George:  They’ve been running tests all day, and the doct or is supposed to come by after her rounds to talk to us.  Hopefully, we’ll get  some answers then, and she’ll give us an update on Uncle Peter’s condition.  Com e on, I’ll take you to the ICU.

Inez:  Okay, but I really dread seeing him on a respirato r and hooked up to monitors.

George:  This is it, room 323.

 Inez:  Oh, look at him.  What are all of these IV drip s for?  He looks so lifeless in that hospital bed.  Is he under sedation?

George:  Yeah, I think so.  We’ll know more when the d octor gets here.  Oh, here she is.

Inez:  Let’s hope she has some answers for us.

[end of dialogue]

George begins by saying to Inez, “You’re just in time.”  “In time” means before something is ending, before something is no longer possib le.  To tell someone that they are “just in time” means that a few minutes l ater, or maybe an hour later they would not be able to do what they can do now.  Ge orge says, “There’s only another 20 minutes until the end of visiting hours.”  “ Visiting hours” are times when family and friends can see and visit patients in a h ospital.  A “patient” is someone who is sick.  So, it’s the time you can go to the hospital and talk to somebody who’s there.  Every hospital has different visiting  hours.

Inez says, “I got here as soon as I could (as fast as I could ).  How is Uncle Peter?”  George says, “They moved him from the emergency w ard to the intensive care unit.”  In a hospital, the different par ts or sections of the hospital are called “wards” (wards).  For babies that are going  to be born, you go to the “maternity ward.”  That’s where they deliver babies.  Th ere was a famous novel by late Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn called The Ca ncer Ward .  That would be the place in the hospital where they take care  of people who have cancer.  This is the “emergency ward,” it’s for people who  have very serious problems and need immediate attention.  The “intensive  care unit” is a special part of the hospital for people who are so sick they mig ht die soon, so that they are given extra attention (extra care; help) to make sure  they don’t.  George says that Uncle Peter is on life support.  “Life support” i n a hospital are machines that keep a person alive.  Often, they allow the person to br eathe; they prevent the person from dying, if they did not have the life support  they would die.  To be on life support is to be in a very serious situation.

Inez says, “How could this have happened?  How could somebo dy in the prime of his life collapse suddenly like that?”  Inez doesn’t un derstand why Uncle Peter is sick.  She says he’s in the prime of his life.  The expressi on “the prime (prime) of (one’s) life” are the best years, the years where you  are almost always going to be healthy.  Maybe it’s between 20 and 70, depends o n the person.  I’m 46, so I’m in the prime of my life.  Uncle Peter suddenly colla psed.  “To collapse” means

 to fall down suddenly because you feel sick; you feel weak; perhaps you become unconscious, like you were sleeping.  That’s to collapse.

George says that the doctors have been “running tests” (d oing tests) all day, trying to find out what is wrong.  “The doctor,” he says,  “is supposed to come by (is supposed to visit) after her rounds to talk to us.”  “ Rounds” (rounds) are when a doctor goes and sees all of his or her patients, usually in a certain order: first they go to this ward, then they go to that ward; first they see this person, then they see that person.  It’s sort of like the plan that do ctors follow to visit all of the patients that they have.  George says, “Hopefully, we’ll g et some answers then (when the doctor comes), and she’ll give us an update (t he most recent information) on Uncle Peter’s condition (how Peter is doing).”  I should mention that the word “round” that we just talked about has seve ral different meanings in English.  If you’re member of ESL Podcast, you can find o ut what those are by going to the Learning Guide for this episode.  You can  also find other meanings of the word “condition” in that same Learning Guide.

George says, “Come on, I’ll take you to the ICU.”  The “ICU” is the intensive care unit, often called, simply, “ICU.”  Inez says, “Okay, but I  really dread seeing him on a respirator and hooked up to monitors.”  “To drea d” (dread) means not to want to do something because you are very worried or you’ re anxious about what will happen.  Uncle Peter is on a respirator.  A “resp irator” is a machine that helps you breathe by pushing oxygen into your lungs.  It allows yo u to breathe even if you can’t breathe on your own.  It’s very common when som eone is ill that they are so weak that they cannot breathe properly, and so r espirators are used to keep them alive.  Inez says Uncle Peter is hooked up to moni tors.  “To be hooked up to (something)” means to be connected to som ething.  A “monitor” is a machine, especially in a hospital, that tells you how the  person – the patient is doing: their heart rate, their blood pressure, and so  forth.

George says, “This is it,” they’ve been walking to the ICU .  “This is it,” he says, “room 323.”  Inez says, “Oh, look at him (meaning Uncle Peter).  What are all of these IV drips for?”  “IV” stands for intravenous.  “IV drip” is a clear, usually, plastic bag that is full of liquid, often with medicine  in it, and it hangs next to the patient.  It is hooked up to the patient; there’s actua lly something that goes in, usually, to the patient’s arm.  This allows, for example,  for the doctors to make sure the person keeps “hydrated,” make sure they have enoug h water.  It is also a way of giving medicine to a person who is sick.  You’ll o ften see IVs next to patients in hospitals.

 Inez then says, “He looks so lifeless in that hospital bed.”   “To be lifeless” is to be without life, basically like you’re dead.  Inez says, “Is he  under sedation?” “Sedation” is medicine that makes you very sleepy; it calms yo u down.  Often, if someone is under sedation, you can’t talk to them because they’re sleeping or they don’t respond normally to you.  George says, “Yeah, I think so.  We’ll know more when the doctor gets here.  Oh, here she is.”  Ine z then says, “Let’s hope she has some answers for us.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

George:  You’re just in time.  There’s only another 20  minutes until the end of visiting hours.

Inez:  I got here as soon as I could.  How is Uncle Peter?

George:  They moved him from the emergency ward to the intensive care unit. He’s on life support.

# Describing Brisk and Slow Business

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 68: Describing Brisk and Slow Business.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 568.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to become a member  of ESL Podcast, and receive a Learning Guide for each of our episodes.  You  can also support our podcast by making a small donation to help keep these aud io files free for the world.

On this episode, we are going to be talking about when  business is good – when a company is doing well, when they are doing brisk busine ss, a lot of business – and when they are doing not so well, slow business.  Let ’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Clint:  Anya!  Long time no see.  Let me buy you a dri nk.  I’m celebrating.

Anya:  Oh, yeah?  What’s the good news?

Clint:  My company has had a banner month.  Since we lau nched our new line of software, we’re having trouble keeping up with demand.   Every product is flying off the shelves.

Anya:  Wow, that’s great news.  Everybody I talk to is singi ng a different tune. Foot traffic is down and business is slow – really slow.

Clint:  That’s too bad.  I thought that Yao’s company w as doing brisk business. Six months ago, he was selling a line of cell phones tha t was all the rage, and customers were beating down his door to get one.

Anya:  That was six months ago.  It’s a different story now .  Those cell phones are now considered passé, and he has inventory he can’t un load.  You know how fickle the market is.

Clint:  I’m sorry to hear that.  How about you?  How’s the travel business?

 Anya:  Why do you think I’m sitting here crying in my beer?   Pull up a chair and I’ll tell you my sob story.

[end of dialogue]

Clint begins by saying, “Anya!  Long time no see.”  This is an old expression which means it’s been a long time since we have seen each o ther.  “Long time no see.  Let me buy you a drink.”  Of course, if he’s bu ying her a drink that means they’re in, usually, a bar and the drink will be a  beer or wine, possibly a Cuba Libre with a little bit of lime on top – yeah!  So Clint says, “I’m celebrating.” He’s happy about something; something good has happened and he wants to celebrate.

Anya says, “Oh, yeah?  What’s the good news?”  Clint says, “ My company has had a banner month.”  When you say you’ve had a “banner  (something),” as an adjective, it means very good, better than expected.  We o ften use this in talking about a company and how much it is selling, or how wel l is doing, but it could also be, for example, about a person: “Charlie had a b anner year.  He got good grades, he found a new girlfriend, and he won the lo ttery.”  That would be quite a year!  Actually, he won the lottery and then got the ne w girlfriend, so if you’re looking for a new girlfriend just win the lottery!

Clint continues, “Since we launched our new line of sof tware, we’re having trouble keeping up with the demand.”  “To launch (some thing)” means to start a new project, a new program, maybe even a new business.  I n this case, Clint’s company is starting – is starting to sell a new line of sof tware.  When we use the word “line” in talking about business products or services we  mean they are a group of related products.  Sometimes we use this term in talking about the name or the brand of a product, for example: “He likes the  Guess line of jeans.”  That’s the kind of jeans – the brand, the name – the specific ki nd of jeans that he likes. But in that line, usually there are several different p roducts that are somehow related or similar.

Clint’s company is launching a new line of software, and they’re having trouble keeping up with the demand.  “To keep up with (somethi ng)” is a phrasal verb meaning to be able to reach something, to be able to  do what you’re required to do.  In this case, you’re able to keep up with demand.  The “demand” is people who want to buy things from you; it’s the willingness of  people to buy your product.  There’s two parts in any business: there’s supply, which is what you produce, and then there’s demand, which is what people want.  So, Clint’s company needs to keep up with the demand, or keep up wit h demand, meaning

 they need to make sure they have enough things to sell for the people who want to buy them.  He says, “Every product is flying off the she lves.”  The expression “to fly off the shelves” (shelves) means to sell something v ery quickly.  A “shelf” is like a flat area where you put things in a store so peop le can see them.  Usually there are more than one shelf, so there are several she lves (the plural).  “To fly off the shelves” means to sell something very quickly, So Clin t’s company is selling these pieces of software very quickly.

Anya says, “Wow, that’s great news.  Everybody I talk to is sin ging a different tune.”  A “tune” is like a song; it’s music.  “To sing a d ifferent tune” (tune), however, means to have a different experience than some one else, usually to have a different experience because something has changed a lot.  For example, Anya says that although Clint’s company is successful, other pe ople she has talked to – other businesses – are not successful.  She says,  for example, “Foot traffic is down and business is slow – really slow.”  “Foot traffic” is the number of people who come into a store or a business that come in to by something.  So, if there are fewer people coming, there are fewer peopl e buying, and therefore business will be slow.

Clint says, “That’s too bad.  I thought that Yao’s compan y (Yao must be the name of a friend of theirs) was doing brisk business.”  “ Brisk” (brisk) is an adjective that means very fast; often it means with a lo t of energy, with a lot of excitement.  When we use it to talk about business, howeve r, we mean that they have lot of success, that they’re selling things very quickly.  Clint says, “Six months ago, Yao was selling a line of cell phones that was all the rage.”  When we say something is “all the rage” (rage), we mean it i s very popular, something that suddenly becomes popular and everybody wants to buy it .  A few years ago there was a dance song called “The Macarena,” many years a go.  It was all the rage; everyone wanted to get this song.  [Jeff sings]

Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena Que tu cuerpo es pa’ darle alegria y cosa buena Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena Hey Macarena

I’m very sorry about that; really, I am!  Well, that’s wh at we mean by “all the rage,” very popular.  So, Yao’s company was popular six mon ths ago in fact, customers were beating down his door to get one of the se cell phones.  “To beat down (someone’s) door” is a phrase that means to do anyt hing to get this product.  In this case, it means that the product is very p opular, that all of the customers wanted to buy one of these cell phones.

 Anya says, “That was six months ago.  It’s a different story n ow.  Those cell phones are now considered passé.”  When we say something i s “passé” (passé), with an accent mark over the “e” because it is a foreign  word, we mean it is no longer popular, it is old-fashioned; out of date, we might say.  Anya says that Yao has inventory he can’t unload.  “Inventory” are the thing s that a company owns. So if you makes cell phones, somewhere you have a bunch of cell phones in your building ready to sell.  That’s your inventory.  “To  unload,” in this case, means to sell.  But “unload” can also mean to give somet hing away, especially if nobody wants it.  To try to get rid of something is ano ther meaning of unload. “Unload” has other meanings as well, as does the word “ banner” that we began our dialogue with; look at the Learning Guide and you ’ll find more explanations. Anya continues, “You know how fickle the market is.”  “Fickle ” (fickle) means to change your mind frequently, especially about what you like  and don’t like.  One day I like popcorn, the next day – eh – I don’t really want any.  I’m fickle; I change my mind a lot.  Anya says “the market,” meaning people wh o are buying things or business in general is fickle – it changes quickly.

Clint says, “I’m sorry to hear that.  How about you?  Ho w’s the travel business?” So apparently Anya is in the travel business: airlines, rai lroads, that sort of thing. Anya says, “Why do you think I’m sitting here (here in the  bar) crying in my beer?”  The expression “to cry in your beer” means to dri nk beer or alcohol because you are sad or depressed and you think that the be er will make you feel better.  So, “to cry in your beer” means to be sad and  to try to make yourself happy by having a beer.  Anya says, “Pull up a chair and I’ ll tell you my sob story.”  “To pull up a chair” literally means to take a ch air and put it next to someone to talk to them.  More generally, it means sit d own and listen to someone who is going to tell you a story.  So you pull up  a chair when you are about to listen to a story, and if someone says “pull up a chair,” they mean listen to my story.  Her story is a sob (sob) story.  “To sob,” as a verb, means to cry very emotionally; a “sob story” is a sad story, something that  would make you cry: “The girls spent all night talking about their sob stories related to their ex- boyfriends.”  Something you might want to do over a bee r!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Clint:  Anya!  Long time no see.  Let me buy you a dri nk.  I’m celebrating.

Anya:  Oh, yeah?  What’s the good news?

 Clint:  My company has had a banner month.  Since we lau nched our new line of software, we’re having trouble keeping up with demand.   Every product is flying off the shelves.

Anya:  Wow, that’s great news.  Everybody I talk to is singi ng a different tune. Foot traffic is down and business is slow – really slow.

Clint:  That’s too bad.  I thought that Yao’s company w as doing brisk business. Six months ago, he was selling a line of cell phones tha t was all the rage, and customers were beating down his door to get one.

Anya:  That was six months ago.  It’s a different story now .  Those cell phones are now considered passé, and he has inventory he can’t un load.  You know how fickle the market is.

Clint:  I’m sorry to hear that.  How about you?  How’s the travel business?

Anya:  Why do you think I’m sitting here crying in my beer?   Pull up a chair and I’ll tell you my sob story.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 69: Traveling for Singles.

This episode is called “Traveling for Singles.”  It’s dial ogue between Ray and Samantha talking about someone who is going on a vacatio n by themselves. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ray:  I have a great idea for your next vacation.  You sho uld go on a singles cruise.

Samantha:  I’m not going on a singles cruise.  Everybody will be on the make.

Ray:  That’s the point, isn’t it?  You can take your pi ck of single guys.  What could be better?

Samantha:  I’m not interested in having a fling!

Ray:  You’ll never meet anybody if you don’t get out th ere and mingle.  Look, here’s a 10-day tour through Asia and the tour company w ill even match you with someone before the trip.  You can use the time on the  tour to get better acquainted.

Samantha:  That sounds awful.  What if I don’t like t he person I’m matched with? I’m stuck with him for 10 days, and we’ll both be miserab le.

Ray:  Okay, here’s something you’ll like – a single’s adventu re vacation.  You can enjoy the great outdoors, while you get to know the sing le guys on the tour.  The worst case scenario is that you don’t meet a guy you like.  Y ou’ll still have a great vacation.  What do you have to lose?

 Samantha:  My peace of mind!  Okay, you’re my brother, and you’re trying to look out for me, but leave me alone and stop trying to mar ry me off.  I’m happy being single.  Can’t you get that through your thick skull?

Ray:  Sure, you’re happy.  That’s why you’re always such a ra y of sunshine!

[end of dialogue]

Ray says to Samantha, “I have a great idea for your next va cation.  You should go on a singles cruise.”  Someone who is “single” is someon e who is not married, typically.  A “cruise” is when you go on a very large boat, and usually it travels for three days or seven days.  For example, here in Los Angele s you can go on a cruise from here down to Mexico and back in three or fou r days.  Cruises are popular ways that some people like to take their vacation  – not me, but some people.  “Singles cruises” are cruises were everyone is sing le, or most of the people are single, and the idea is that it will help you find a boyfriend or a girlfriend.

Samantha says, “I’m not going on a singles cruise.  Everybod y will be on the make.”  The expression “to be on the make” (make) means th at you are looking not just for a relationship but specifically for a sexual relationship, not necessarily a permanent one.  Ray has a different opinion of life ; he says, “That’s the point, isn’t it?” meaning that’s the purpose of the single crui se.  “You can take your pick of single guys (meaning men).”  “To take your pick” means that you have many choices.  You can decide what you want, and choose from man y different things; in this case, from many different men.  Ray says, “What coul d be better?” meaning there is no better situation for you than to h ave the choice of all of these single guys.

Samantha says, “I’m not interested in a fling (fling)!”   A “fling,” as a noun, is a romantic relationship but not a serious one, one that  you do not think will last very long.  “Fling” actually has several different meaning s in English; you know where to find those, in the Learning Guide.

Ray says, “You’ll never meet anybody if you don’t get out t here and mingle.”  “To get out there” means to go out where other people ar e; in this case, to go out and try to meet men.  “To mingle” (mingle) means to inter act socially with other people, even if you don’t know them very well, usually at  a party.  Someone invites you to a birthday party and you don’t know most of the people there, you can go and talk to them.  You would mingle, go from o ne person to the next, very informally, and have conversations.  Ray says, “Look, here’s a 10-day tour

 through Asia and the tour company will even match you wit h someone before the trip.”  A “tour” is an organized trip to see different  places, usually with what we would call a “guide,” a leader that explains everything  to you.  This is a 10-day tour through Asia, and the tour company matches you with  someone.  “To match” (match) two people or two things means to put them tog ether.  There are companies on the Internet, for example, where you can tr y to meet someone else, and you can describe the person you want to meet.  T he company then tries to match you, to find someone who fits or who match es that description. “Match” has other meanings as well in English.  Guess wher e you can find those?  That’s right, in the Learning Guide.  I knew yo u knew the answer!

This tour is going to match Samantha with someone befo re the trip.  So they’re going to say you should talk to this man.  Ray says, “You can  use the time on the tour to get better acquainted.”  The expression “to ge t better acquainted” means to become more familiar with another person, to lear n more about someone else. Samantha, however, is not interested; she says, “That soun ds awful (terrible). What if I don’t like the person I’m matched with?”  What if she is matched with someone she doesn’t like?  Then, she says, “I’m stuck with hi m for 10 days, and we’ll both be miserable.”  “To be stuck with (someone o r something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to be forced to have to be with someone, o r to be forced to have to have this situation.  “To be stuck with (someone)” means he re that she would have to be with this person even if she doesn’t want to b e.  Usually it’s a negative thing when someone says “I’m stuck with this,” or “I’m stuck with her.”  It means you’re not very happy.  Samantha says, “then we’ll both b e miserable,” we’ll be terrible, we’ll feel bad.

Ray says, “Okay, here’s something you’ll like,” he’s going to  give her another idea for her vacation.  It’s a single’s adventure vacation .  “Adventure,” in general, means an exciting experience where you do many new things.   Maybe you will climb a mountain or you will hike – that is, walk – a lo ng distance through the forest.  I’m not sure; I have never been on an adventur e vacation.  Ray says, “You can enjoy the great outdoors.”  “The great outdoo rs” is a term that means nature, the world outside of the cities and the towns.  He says, “You can enjoy the great outdoors while you get to know the single gu ys on the tour.”  So you can meet single men on this tour.  He says, “The worst case  scenario is that you don’t meet a guy you like.”  “The worst case scenario” is  the worst thing that can happen, the thing that would be more terrible than anything else.  So Ray is saying that it can’t be that bad, because the worst thi ng that could happen is that she doesn’t meet a man.  Ray says, “You’ll still have a gre at vacation.  What do you have to lose?”  The expression “What do have to lose?” means that you should do something because there are no negative conseque nces or results,

 and there might be something good: “Call the girl you  met today at the party and ask her out on a date.  Ask her to go to coffee with you.   You have nothing to lose.”  If she says no, well, then, you’ll probably never see her again – unless the party was at your office, in which case – hmm – maybe that ’s not a good idea!

Samantha answers the question “What do you have to lose? ” by saying “My peace of mind!”  “Peace (peace) of mind” means tranquil ity, calmness, the feeling of relaxation, of satisfaction.  Samantha says she wouldn’t  be very relaxed on a singles adventure vacation.  She says to Ray, “Okay, you’re m y brother, and you’re trying to look out for me.”  “To look out for ( someone)” is a phrasal verb meaning to make sure the other person is okay.  If you have  a young brother or sister you want to protect them; you want to look out for them.  Samantha says, however, “leave me alone (stop bothering me) and stop t rying to marry me off.” “To marry (someone) off” is another phrasal verb meanin g to try to find a husband or wife for someone, to arrange a marriage for someone.  A father may try to marry off his daughter, who is still living at hom e and doesn’t have a job. Probably won’t be very successful, however!  Or, you may try t o marry off your older brother, who doesn’t do very well with women.

Samantha says, “I’m happy being single.  Can’t you get th at through your thick skull (skull)?”  When you say to someone “to get something t hrough their thick skull,” you’re saying that you are frustrated with the ot her person who doesn’t understand something because they’re too stupid or too slo w.  The “skull” is the large bones in your head that keep your brain in.  When  we say someone has a “thick skull,” we mean they’re not very smart.  So this is an  informal, very rude thing, not a nice thing to say to someone.  “Why can’t yo u get that through your thick skull” means that you are stupid and you don’t underst and what I am saying to you.

Ray says, “Sure, you’re happy (you’re happy being single Sa mantha).  That’s why you’re always such a ray of sunshine!”  “To be a ray (ra y) of sunshine” means to be a very happy person.  But usually we use this exp ression sarcastically, trying to make a joke, and that’s what Ray is doing here.  Samantha is not a very happy person, she just insulted him, so Ray i s making a joke, saying “you’re such a ray of sunshine.”  It really means you are n ot very happy; you’re not very cheerful.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Ray:  I have a great idea for your next vacation.  You sho uld go on a singles cruise.

Samantha:  I’m not going on a singles cruise.  Everybody will be on the make.

Ray:  That’s the point, isn’t it?  You can take your pi ck of single guys.  What could be better?

This episode is called “Guessing a Number.”  It’s a dialog ue between Angela and Dwight.  It’s also going to be using some vocabulary not  just about guessing, but – well, about numbers.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Angela:  Hey, look at this.  This restaurant is holding a  contest.  If you can guess the number of marbles in this bowl, you’ll get a free meal every day for one year!

Dwight:  I’ll take a stab at it.

Angela:  So will I.  Let’s see, I think there must be cl ose to 1,000 or 1,200 marbles in there.  What are you doing?

Dwight:  I’m doing some calculations in my head.  The bo wl is about 75 percent full, and it’s 15 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches (15”x12”x6” ).  The marbles are about /.notdef.g0001 of an inch in diameter…

Angela:  Are you actually trying to figure out the capaci ty by crunching the numbers?  This is a game.  You’re supposed to guess.

Dwight:  I know it’s a game, but I want to increase my chances by making an educated guess.  Hold on, I just need to do one more ca lculation and I’ll have the magic number.

Angela:  That’s cheating.

 Dwight:  No way!  I’m just using what God gave me to b eat you out of a year’s worth of meals.

Angela:  Bring it on.  I’ll pit my random guess again st your educated guess any day!

[end of dialogue]

Angela says to Dwight, “Hey, look at this.  This restaurant  is holding a contest.” A “contest” is a competition where different people par ticipate to try to win something.  We often use the verb “hold”: “I’m going t o hold a contest,” I’m going to have a competition.  “If you can guess the number of marbles in this bowl, you’ll get a free meal every day for one year!”  “To gue ss” means to provide an answer even though you’re not sure if it is correct.  “G uess” actually has several meanings in English; you’ll find those in this episode’s L earning Guide.  “Marbles” are small, round pieces of colored glass.  You often find  them with children; they play a game where they roll the marbles on the floor.   This is, at one time, a popular contest in restaurants; they would have a big g lass bowl full of these little marbles and you had to try to guess the number of marble s in there.  Many different people would guess, and then if you guessed i t correctly you got some prize.

Dwight says, “I’ll take a stab (stab) at it.”  “To take a stab at (something)” means to either make a guess or try to do something even thou gh you will probably not be right, even though you may not succeed or be successful.  “To take a stab at” means to attempt to do something.  Angela says, “So will  I (meaning I will try to guess, too).  Let’s see, I think there must be close to 1,0 00 or 1,200 marbles in there.  What are you doing?”

Dwight says, “I’m doing some calculations in my head.”  “Ca lculations” are when you combine numbers: you add them, you subtract them, you m ultiply them, or you divide them to find out how much of something ther e is.  In general, calculations are what you do to solve some sort of mathemat ical problem. Dwight is doing them “in his head,” meaning mentally, not with a machine.  He says, “The bowl is about 75 percent full.”  “Percent (%)”  is 100th; it’s the amount of something out of 100 parts.  So, 75 percent would be 75 out of 100.  So, the bowl is 75 percent, or /.notdef.g0001 full; it’s about 15 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches (15”x12”x6”).  We talk about or use the word “by” when we are describing the length, the width, and the height of something.  If we say it’s 15 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches, we mean it is 15 inches long, 12 inches w ide, and 6 inches high.  Dwight says, “The marbles are about /.notdef.g0001 of an inch in diameter.”  “Three

 quarters (/.notdef.g0001)” or “three fourths” is used also when talking about pa rt of something. Three fourths is written three over four ( /.notdef.g0001), there’s a diagonal line that divides them.  It’s the same, of course, as 75 percent, that’s th ree fourths of 100.  The marbles are /.notdef.g0001 of an inch in diameter.  “Diameter” (diameter) is the distance across a circle.  If you take a circle and you cut it in half,  that length is the diameter.

Angela then says, “Are you actually trying to figure out  the capacity by crunching the numbers?”  “To figure out” means to understand, to  get an answer.  Dwight is trying to figure out the capacity of this jar where the marbles are.  “Capacity” is the amount of space available.  “To crunch the numbers”  is an idiom which means to make a mathematical calculation.  Often we tal k about that when, for example, we have a new project but we’re not sure if we  have enough money. We need to find out exactly how much it’s going to cost, I  may say, “I need to crunch the numbers.”

Angela says, “This is a game.  You’re supposed to guess.”  Dwight says, “I know it’s a game, but I want to increase my chances by making a n educated guess.” “To increase your chances” means to increase the likelihood  – the possibilities for you to win, to be successful.  If you are interviewing for a new job and you go to the interview in your swimming outfit – your swimming  trunks, which is what we call what a man wears, or your swimming suit for a w oman – well, that’s not really a very good strategy.  You could increase your chance s by wearing a suit instead of a bikini – although I look pretty good in a bikini!  Dwight says that he’s trying to make an educated guess.  An “educated guess” is st ill a guess – you still don’t know, but you have some facts or experience or knowledge that will help you make your guess.  Dwight says, “Hold on (wait one second), I just need to do one more calculation and I’ll have the magic numb er.”  “The magic number” just means the correct number here.

Angela says, “That’s cheating.”  “Cheating” is when you do  something against the rules, especially in a game, and this is contest – a kind of  game.  Dwight says, “No way (meaning that is completely wrong)!  I’m just usi ng what God gave me to beat you out of a year’s worth of meals.”  The expression “to use what God gave you (or someone)” means that you take advantage – you use  the intelligence and talent that you were born with.  This is especially true when many people do not have those talents.  So, if you are a very good skier, you could use what God gave you to go to the Olympics, for example.  Dwight says th at he’s going to use what God gave him – presumably, we’re guessing, the ma thematical ability he has – he’s going to use that to beat Angela out of a ye ar’s worth of meals.  “To beat (someone) out of (something)” means to win a ga me, a contest, or a

 competition against another person.  You win the price;  you take first place – you beat someone out of.  You can also say that, for example,  about a job: “He beat me out for that job at Berkeley.”  You could, I suppose,  say it about a woman or a man: “I beat my friend out for the affections and love  of this particular woman.” Hopefully, you are not in a competition!

Angela says to Dwight, “Bring it on.”  This is an inform al expression that’s used to show when you’re ready to do something; you’re ready for a friendly competition. “Bring it on” means I’m ready; I’m ready to enter into  this game and beat you. Angela says, “I’ll pit my random guess against your educated  guess any day!” “To pit (pit) (something) against (something else)” mea ns to test one thing against another, to see how well one person can do som ething compared to another person.  Angela says that she’s going to make a “random” guess, meaning she’s not going to try to calculate, she’s not g oing to crunch the numbers; she’s just going to take a random – we might say a “wild” – guess. She’s going to pit – she’s going to basically say my random guess is as good as – really better than your educated guess.  “Pit” Has a co uple of different meanings in English; of course, those are found in the L earning Guide.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Angela:  Hey, look at this.  This restaurant is holding a  contest.  If you can guess the number of marbles in this bowl, you’ll get a free meal every day for one year!

Dwight:  I’ll take a stab at it.

Angela:  So will I.  Let’s see, I think there must be cl ose to 1,000 or 1,200 marbles in there.  What are you doing?

This episode is called “Assigning Blame in a Car Accident.”   “Blame” is who did something wrong.  So figuring out – determining – wh o did something wrong when two cars have an accident.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Tarik:  Are you okay?

Stacey:  Yeah, I think so.  I’m just a little shaken up, but look at my car!

Tarik:  Mine is in pretty bad shape, too.  Good thing, though, it wasn’t totaled.

Stacey:  Okay, let’s exchange insurance information, so we ca n both get out of here.

Tarik:  Right.  I’ll put in a claim today and your insur ance should pay to repair both of our cars.

Stacey:  What?  This accident wasn’t my fault.  You crashed into me!  You rear ended me!

Tarik:  That’s only because you swerved in front of me and  slammed on your brakes!

Stacey:  I did no such thing.  I changed lanes and you beg an tailgating me. That’s why you rear ended me.  I’m not to blame here.

 Tarik:  That’s your account of what happened, and it doe sn’t jibe with mine.  I say we each call our respective insurance companies and let th em battle it out.

Stacey:  Fine.  There’s no point in arguing with someon e who won’t own up to his mistakes.

Tarik:  Those are my thoughts exactly.

[end of dialogue]

Tarik and Stacey had a “car accident,” one car hit the ot her.  Tarik begins, after he gets out of the car I guess, by asking Stacey, “Are you o kay?” meaning physically.  Stacey says, “Yeah, I think so.  I’m just a little  shaken up, but look at my car!”  “To be shaken (shaken) up” means to be shocked, scare d, a little confused especially after something very traumatic, somethin g that may cause you pain either emotional or physical.  In this case, it w as the car accident that shook up Stacey.  The phrasal verb is “to shake up.”

Stacey is worried about her car.  Tarik says, “Mine (mean ing my car) is in pretty bad shape, too,” meaning very bad shape, very damaged.  Tarik says, “Good thing, though, it wasn’t totaled.”  Notice he doesn’ t say “It is a good thing,” he uses a sentence form here that isn’t necessarily completely gr ammatical but is quite common normal conversation, especially with this phr ase “good thing.” “Good thing you’re okay,” that means it is a good thing  that you are okay.  Tarik says, “Good thing, it (his car) wasn’t totaled.”  When you  “total your car” you completely destroy it, usually by accident – we hope!  “Tota l” has a number of different meanings that are different than that; you can find those, or at least some of them, in the Learning Guide.

When you have a car accident in the United States, many t imes people will call the police.  However if it’s not a serious accident, that isn’t always necessary. Instead, people will give each other their contact infor mation, especially their insurance information.  So Stacey says, “Okay, let’s exchange  insurance information, so we can both get out of here (we can b oth leave).”  “Insurance” is when you pay a small amount of money to a company each m onth or each year, and then if something bad happens to you, like a car a ccident, they will pay to fix your car.  Stacey and Tarik exchange this information; she g ives her information to him, he gives his information to her.

Tarik says, “Right.  I’ll put in a claim today and your in surance should pay to repair both of our cars.”  Now, this is where the prob lem starts.  When you have a

 car accident, you should not argue with the other person.   It doesn’t matter what you think or what the other person thinks, it matters wha t the insurance company thinks.  If you have two different insurance companies – T arik has one, Stacey has another – then the person who is to blame – that i s, the person you caused the accident; we would also say who is “at fault” – their  insurance company has to pay to fix the other car, as well as the car of their  insured customer.  Tarik is saying that Stacey caused the accident because he’s saying tha t her insurance should pay to repair both of their cars.  In order to g et the insurance company to pay for the damage in an accident, you have to put in a “claim” (claim).  That means you have to send them documents – pieces of paper – r equesting a payment – requesting that they pay you.

Stacey says, “What?  This accident wasn’t my fault.”  “Faul t,” here, means responsibility.  “Fault” has a number of other meaning s, and those are in the Learning Guide.  Stacey is saying that the accident, the  fact that the two cars hit each other – crashed into each other – was not her fau lt.  Stacey says, “You crashed into me!”  “To crash into” means to hit someone w hile you’re moving at a high speed.  So, a car could crash into a tree if it’s g oing very fast.  Stacey says that Tarik crashed into her car, so it’s his fault.  She says, “You rear ended me!” “To rear (rear) end (someone)” is a two-word phrasal ve rb meaning when one car hits the back of another car, usually because that car wa s too close – was traveling too close – and so they did not stop in time – they did not stop before they hit the other car.  That’s to rear end someone.  I t’s always used in talking about cars, typically.

Tarik says, arguing now with Stacey, “That’s only because you  swerved in front of me and slammed on your brakes!”  “To swerve” (swerve) me ans to turn sharply, quickly, and suddenly to try to avoid hitting someth ing else.  So you’re in your car and you’re driving down the road and you see a c at in front of you, you might swerve so that you don’t hit the cat.  I might not !  But you will probably swerve; you will move your car quickly to the left or to the  right.  Tarik is saying that Stacey swerved in front of him – in front of his ca r, and then she slammed on her brakes.  “To slam (slam) on your brakes (or the brakes) ” means to stop your car suddenly, very, we might say, abruptly.  Your “brakes” a re the part of the car that stops the wheels from moving, and you have a little thing in the front of your car by your foot called a “brake pedal” (pedal) that you  step on – you press – in order to stop the car.  “To slam on your brakes” means to  do that suddenly, quickly.  That’s what Stacey did according to Tarik, and the refore Tarik didn’t have a chance to stop after she did this, because it was so su dden.

 Stacey says, “I did no such thing (meaning I didn’t do an ything like that).  I changed lanes and you began tailgating me.”  The parts of the road where you drive are called the “lanes.”  Usually in a big street th ere are two lanes going in one direction and two lanes in another direction, so th ere are two rows of cars. What Stacey is saying is that Stacey changed lanes – moved fro m the right lane, let’s say, to the left lane – and Tarik began tailgatin g Stacey.  “To tailgate” (tailgate – one word) means to follow closely behind an other car, to be too close to the car in front of you.  Stacey says, “That’s why you rear ended me.  I’m not to blame here,” I’m not the one who is at fault.

Tarik says, “That’s your account (that’s your version; your stor y) of what happened, and it doesn’t jibe (jibe) with mine (with  my story).”  “To jibe” means to match, so that it’s the same information.  Here they have  two different stories; they don’t jibe.  “I say we each call our respective insur ance companies and let them battle it out.”  “Respective” means you call your co mpany and I’ll call my company; it’s what belongs to you and what belongs to me.   “Respective” belongs to a certain person, so: “The children after schoo l go home to their respective houses,” the ones that are theirs.  Tarik says we’l l let the insurance companies battle it out.  This expression, “to battle it out,” means to argue or to fight over something, usually for a long period of tim e.  To battle it out – to have a long argument or fight.

Stacey says, “Fine.  There’s no point in arguing with som eone (there’s no reason to argue with someone) who won’t own up to his mistakes. ”  “To own up” means to admit that you are responsible, that you are wrong; you say yes, that was my fault, I am to blame.  So, Stacey is saying that Tarik w ill not own up to his mistakes, the things he did wrong.  Tarik, of course, thi nks that Stacey is in the same situation; she won’t own up to her mistakes.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Tarik:  Are you okay?

Stacey:  Yeah, I think so.  I’m just a little shaken up, but look at my car!

Tarik:  Mine is in pretty bad shape, too.  Good thing, though, it wasn’t totaled.

Stacey:  Okay, let’s exchange insurance information, so we ca n both get out of here.

 Tarik:  Right.  I’ll put in a claim today and your insur ance should pay to repair both of our cars.

Stacey:  What?  This accident wasn’t my fault.  You crashed into me!  You rear ended me!

Tarik:  That’s only because you swerved in front of me and  slammed on your brakes!

Stacey:  I did no such thing.  I changed lanes and you beg an tailgating me. That’s why you rear ended me.  I’m not to blame here.

Tarik:  That’s your account of what happened, and it doe sn’t jibe with mine.  I say we each call our respective insurance companies and let th em battle it out.

Stacey:  Fine.  There’s no point in arguing with someon e who won’t own up to his mistakes.

Tarik:  Those are my thoughts exactly.

I hope my explanation of today’s dialogue jibes with the ideas of the person who wrote it, Dr. Lucy Tse.

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 72: Blowing the Whistle at Work.

This dialogue is between Becky and Saeed; it’s about blow ing the whistle.  “To blow the whistle” is to tell someone about something th at is wrong in your company or organization.  If someone is doing something i llegal like stealing, to blow the whistle would be to tell your boss or to tell the police.  Let’s get started

[start of dialogue]

Becky:  What are we going to do?

Saeed:  I don’t know.  I need time to think about the  ramifications of blowing the whistle.

Becky:  There are no two ways about it.  If we step up a nd do the right thing, we are putting our jobs on the line.

Saeed:  But we can’t keep quiet about this.  If it get s out, and we knew about it all along, we’ll get into even more trouble.  And plus, t hink of how many people would be hurt if we kept our mouths shut.  Could we li ve with that?

Becky:  Maybe there is a way for us to protect our interest s and still do the right thing.  Maybe we could be anonymous whistleblowers.

Saeed:  Don’t count on being able to remain anonymous.   When this thing blows up, we’ll be in knee-deep.  There’s only one thing to do.

Becky:  What?

 Saeed:  I have to put my money where my mouth is and g o public with what we know.  I’ll just have to let the chips fall where they ma y.

Becky:  Don’t be too hasty.  Let’s sleep on it and talk abo ut it tomorrow.

Saeed:  You can do that if you want to, but I’ve made  up my mind.  The question is: Are you with me?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Becky saying to Saeed, “What are  we going to do?” Saeed says, “I don’t know.  I need time to think about t he ramifications of blowing the whistle.”  “Ramifications” are consequences, implicat ions, something that will happen because you do something, especially when you’re n ot exactly sure what will happen if you do something: the consequences of your actions.  To blow the whistle means to share information about something wron g or bad that someone is doing because you want to stop it; you’re either telli ng someone in your company – the president or your boss – about something th at people are doing wrong, or you’re perhaps telling the government that yo ur company or organization is doing something wrong or illegal.

Becky says, “There are no two ways about it.”  This an idiom  that means there is no doubt, it’s very clear; this can happen in only one wa y, there are no different options for us.  There’s only one thing we can do, that’ s the meaning of there are no two ways about it.  She says, “If we step up and do the right thing, we are putting our jobs on the line.”  She saying that this i s what will happen, there is no other choice for us.  “If we step up,” that is, if we vol unteer to do or to participate in this action – if we come forward, which is another ph rasal verb that means the same thing – if we go to the boss or to the government , “we are putting our jobs on the line.”  Something that is “on the line” is some thing that is at risk, in danger, there’s a possibility that you could lose it.  To say your j ob is on the line means depending on what I do I could lose my job very soon.

Saeed says, “But we can’t keep quiet about this (we can’t not tell anyone).  If it gets out, and we knew about it all along, we’ll get i nto even more trouble.”  Notice the very popular word “get” in English; there are all sorts of phrasal verbs – two- word verbs that use the verb “get.”  This one is “get o ut.”  “To get out” means for information – secret or private information to become public, to become known by many people.  There are other meanings of this expressi on also, and those are in the Learning Guide.

 Saeed says, “If it gets out (if this news about this bad t hing is publicized – if people find out about it), we’ll get into even more trouble.”  Notice “into,” the preposition, connected with “get.”  “To get into trou ble” means to be in trouble, to go from not being in trouble to being in trouble.  Saeed says, “And plus (meaning in addition), think of how many people would be hurt if we kept our mouths shut.” “To keep your mouth shut” means not to tell anyone, not to say anything to anyone else, to be quiet.  This is something I have a gre at deal of difficulty doing: keeping my mouth shut.  My wife tells me this almost every d ay!  Saeed is worried that people will get hurt if they don’t tell  someone; he says, “Could we live with that?”  “To live with” means to be able to t olerate something.  It’s a phrasal verb meaning to put up with something, to be a ble to continue living your life.

Becky says, “Maybe there is a way for us to protect our intere sts and still do the right thing.”  “To protect your interests” means you are taking care of yourself, you are making sure you don’t get hurt.  She wants to pr otect herself, but she also wants to do the right thing.  She says then, “Maybe  we could be anonymous whistleblowers.”  “To be anonymous” means that no one kno ws your name, that no one knows who you are.  So, you write a note to a gi rl you like but you don’t put your name on the note; the note is anonymous.  I’m  not sure why you would do that; it seems kind of stupid to me.  You, of course,  would want the girl to know your name.  But, I suppose maybe you want to provide some mystery about your identity – it’s possible!

Back to the story, Saeed says, “Don’t count on being able to remain anonymous.” “Don’t count on” means don’t rely upon, don’t depend u pon, it’s not for certain. Saeed says, “When this thing blows up, we’ll be in knee-d eep.”  “To blow up” here means to become a major problem, to be a situatio n that will affect many different people in a bad way.  “To blow up” has othe r meanings in English as a phrasal verb; those are in that Learning Guide we talke d about earlier.  So, Saeed is saying, “When this thing blows up (when people find out about it and it becomes a big problem), we’ll be in knee-deep.”  “To be in knee (knee) -deep” means to be heavily involved in something, you are very much  involved in it. Often, it’s a bad thing, but you could also say “I’m knee -deep in work this week,” I have so much work I can barely think, I’m heavily involved in  it.

Saeed says, “There’s only one thing to do.”  Becky asks, “What ?”  He says, “I have to put my money where my mouth is and go public wit h what we know.” This is an expression: “to put your money where your mouth  is,” it means to stop talking about something and actually do it; not just to say you’re going to run a

 marathon, but actually to practice and run the maratho n.  We use it when someone has finally decided to do something that they’ve b een talking about.  It also is used sometimes when you give advice to someone, and yo u need to actually do something as part of that advice: “I’m going to help you find a job.”  I promise you something; I’m going to put my money where m y mouth is, I’m actually going to call some people to find you a job.  “ To go public” means to share information with many people, especially the newspa pers or the television news programs.

Saeed says, “I’ll just have to let the chips fall where th ey may.”  This expression, “to let the chips (chips) fall where they may,” means to  do something even though something bad might be a result of your action, to do something and not think about the positive or negative ramifications, or con sequences, of your action.

Becky, however, says, “Don’t be too hasty” (hasty).  That mea ns don’t be so rushed, don’t do it quickly, think about this decision.   She says, “Let’s sleep on it and talk about it tomorrow.”  “To sleep on it” means t o think about something overnight; to go home, to fall asleep, continue thinkin g about it, and the next day you make your decision.  Saeed says, “You can do that if you  want to, but I’ve made up my mind (I’ve decided).  The question is: Are yo u with me?” meaning are you going to help me; support me; agree with me.

Let’s listen to the dialogue now at a normal speed.

[start of dialogue]

Becky:  What are we going to do?

Saeed:  I don’t know.  I need time to think about the  ramifications of blowing the whistle.

Becky:  There are no two ways about it.  If we step up a nd do the right thing, we are putting our jobs on the line.

Saeed:  But we can’t keep quiet about this.  If it get s out, and we knew about it all along, we’ll get into even more trouble.  And plus, t hink of how many people would be hurt if we kept our mouths shut.  Could we li ve with that?

# Discussing Social Class

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 573: Discussing Social Class.  This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 573.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.  Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download the Learning Guide for this episode, a special 8- to 10-page guide we provide for all of our episodes to help you improve your English even faster.  This episode is called “Discussing Social Class.”  It’s a dialogue between Hector and Sophia using a lot of vocabulary related to talking about people at different social and economic levels in a country.  Let’s get started.  [start of dialogue]  Hector:  Can you believe James?  All evening, he tried to tell me how this country would be better if we had no social classes.  He’s out of his mind.  Sophia:  He was just trying to get a rise out of you.  We all know that the two of you don’t see eye to eye.  Hector:  He thinks that just because he comes from a working-class background, he can criticize anyone who is middle class or upper class.  I just can’t stand his holier-than-thou attitude.  Sophia:  He knows you, and he knows which buttons to push to get you worked up.  I don’t think he was serious when he said he thought class warfare was a good idea.  Hector:  Well, he was downright insulting.  He talks as though we have no sense of social responsibility.  We do our share for the poor.  What more does he want from me?  Sophia:  I think he has a chip on his shoulder, because his parents are blue collar and he now lives in a white-collar world.  He feels he has to stand up for the marginalized people in our society. # Shopping for Produce

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 74: Shopping for Produce.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 574.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can go there to learn the secret of life!  You can also download a Learning Guide for this episode that co ntains information, including a complete transcript to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Shopping for Produce.”  “Produce”  includes fruits and vegetables.  Let’s get started. > On my way home from work, I stopped at the supermarket.  My doctor has been telling me to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, so I  finally decided to follow her advice.  I resolved to eat better, so I could feel better.  I made a beeline for the produce department.
> First, I looked at some bananas.  Since they ripen off t he vine, I picked out some that were already ripe and others that were still gree n.  Next, I looked for some tomatoes.  They looked picked over, but then I saw some org anic tomatoes and decided to give those a try.  Then, I went to look for t he spinach.  I found it, but it didn’t look fresh at all.  The leaves were brown and wi lted.  I decided to pass on the spinach and checked out the mushrooms.  The mushrooms di dn’t look any better.  In fact, some were beginning to rot.  I picked  up some lettuce instead and headed for the checkout stand.
> I was feeling pretty good about my new decision to eat b etter.  But then, I passed the cookie aisle.  My resolve weakened.  I spotted my favor ite type of cookies. Before I knew what I was doing, I’d put a bag of those  cookies in my cart.
> I know I should be able to resist impulse buys, especially of things I’m likely to eat all in one sitting, but don’t forget, I’m eating  more fruits and vegetables.  With my new healthy diet, aren’t I allowed to fall off the  wagon now and then?

 Our story begins with me coming home from work.  I decid e to stop at the “supermarket,” which is a large store that sells many types  of food.  A “market” is a general word for a store, especially a story that sell s food.  A supermarket is just a big market.  “My doctor,” I say, “has been telling me to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables.”  “Fresh” is, in this case, an adjective th at means recently picked – recently taken from the trees or the fields where the y were grown.  These are fruits and vegetables that are ready to be eaten or to  be cooked; in other words, they’re not in a can, they’re the actual vegetable right  from the farm.

I say that I was going to eat more fruits and vegetables because my doctor recommended that to me.  I resolved to eat better, so I could feel better.  “To resolve” here means to make a firm decision to change som ething in your behavior, usually to change something in your life.  the noun is “resolution.”  It’s very common for people to make New Year’s resolutions.  Wh en the first of January comes up every year they say, “Okay, I’m going to stop  smoking,” or “This year I’m going to stop eating a pound of chocolate  every day,” something like that.  That’s a resolution; the verb is “to resolve. ”  “To resolve” can also mean to solve a problem or a conflict, an argument, something  like that.

I say next that I made a beeline for the produce depar tment.  The expression “to make a beeline (beeline – one word) for (something)” means to go directly to a particular place or to a particular person without stopp ing to look at or to talk to anyone else; you go directly to that person.  When childre n go to the library, some of them make a beeline for the comic books.  They wal k in the door, and they run over to the comic books; they don’t stop and loo k at anything else. Some men, when they walk into a bar, make a beeline for the beautiful women. Of course, I did not make a beeline for any women; I ma de a beeline for the produce department.  “Produce” means fresh fruits and v egetables; it’s a general term.

First, I looked at some “bananas,” those are yellow pie ces of fruit that are long and they grow on trees – I think.  I say that since bana nas, or because bananas ripen off the vine, I picked some that were already rip e.  “To ripen (ripen) off the vine (vine)” means that they continue to mature and beco me “ripe,” or ready to eat, after they are removed from the plant.  So ther e some fruits, for example, that you can take it off of the tree, like a banana, an d you wait a couple of days, and it will turn from green to yellow indicating it i s now ready to eat.  There are some fruits that do not ripen off the vine, meaning you  have to wait until they are ready – until they are ripe before you remove it from t he tree or the plant.  A “vine” technically is a plant that grows certain kinds of f ruit.  Grapes, for example,

 and tomatoes, grow on what we call vines.  “To ripen of f the vine,” however, is a general term referring to fruit that matures after i t has been picked, or removed from the plant or tree where it was growing.  So beca use bananas ripen off the vine, you can pick those bananas that are still green.  A g reen banana indicates it is not yet ripe.

Next, I looked for some tomatoes.  They looked picked over.  When we say something is “picked over,” we mean that other customers ha ve come and taken the best ones, so the ones that are left are not very goo d.  That’s what it means to be picked over.  Before I forget, the word “green” has other meanings in English, and those are in the Learning Guide.

I say that the tomatoes were picked over, but then I saw so me organic tomatoes. “Organic” is a very popular adjective describing food now adays.  Usually it means that it is grown naturally, without any chemicals, anything that might damage your health.  Organic food is supposed to be mor e healthy because it doesn’t have these different chemicals that are normally u sed when we are farming – and by “we” I mean other people, not me!

Then I look for some spinach, after I get my organic tom atoes.  I found the spinach, but unfortunately it didn’t look fresh at all.   It was old; it was not recently arrived from the farm.  The leaves on the spinach, the p art of the spinach that is flat and large, were brown and wilted.  When we say so mething is “wilted” (wilted), we mean that the leaves of the fruit or vege table are not fresh, they’re weak, they are bent.  For example, lettuce if put in the oven will very quickly wilt with the heat.  Things often wilt in the heat, and t hat means that they are no longer hard, crisp; they are weak instead, and they star t to look bad, and that’s what happened to leaves of the spinach.

I decided to pass on the spinach.  “To pass on (something)”  here means to decide not to buy or not to use something.  If you’re at  a dinner and someone offers you some hot dogs, and you don’t really like hot d ogs – although I can’t understand why, I love hot dogs!  But you decide, well, hot dogs, they’re not very healthy, so you say to the person, “I think I will pass on the hot dogs,” meaning I’m not going to have any.  “To pass on” has other very d ifferent meanings, and those are in – everyone together – the Learning Guide .

So, I pass on the spinach, and I decide to “check out,” o r go look at (investigate) the mushrooms.  The mushrooms didn’t look any better.  I n fact, some of the mushrooms were beginning to rot (rot).  “To rot” is wh en something that is living, like a plant or a vegetable or a body begins to decay and  decompose.  When

 something dies it begins to fall apart, whether it’s a body or a banana.  Usually it begins to have a bad smell and it begins to come apart physically.  So that is the meaning of to rot; it’s when something that was once li ving dies and begins to smell and look ugly.

The mushrooms, I say, didn’t look any better because they were beginning to rot, so I picked up some lettuce – I took some lettuce and I pu t into my cart.  My “cart” is another word for a shopping cart, which is a la rge metal basket on wheels that you use in a store; you push it.  I picked up so me lettuce and put it in my cart, and I then headed for the checkout stand.  “To h ead for” means to go in the direction of.  The “checkout stand” is the part of the grocery store where you pay for your food.

I was feeling pretty good about my new decision to eat b etter.  But then, I passed (I walked by) the cookie aisle.  In a store, you have usua lly several “aisles.” These are basically rows where you have food on both sides,  usually on shelves. So I pass by the cookie aisle, the aisle that had the cookie s in it, and my resolve weakened.  Remember we mentioned “resolve” as being you r decision to do something – to change something.  Here it’s used as a nou n: my resolve weakened.  “To weaken” means to become less strong, to beco me weaker.  I spotted (I saw) my favorite type of cookies.  Before I knew  what I was doing, I’d put a bag of those cookies in my cart.  So, I saw the cooki es, I could not resist them.  I needed the cookies I thought, so I got them an d I put them in my cart.

Finally I say, “I know I should be able to resist impulse buys.”  An “impulse (impulse) buy (buy)” is something that you buy that you wer e not planning on buying.  You did not have the idea before you got to the store, but you saw it and you decided to buy it.  I say, “I know I should be able to  resist impulse buys (meaning not buy those things), especially of things I’m likely to eat all in one sitting.”  “All in one sitting” means all at once, at o ne time.  If you give me a bag of potato chips I will eat them all in one sitting.  “ But,” I say, “don’t forget, I’m eating more fruits and vegetables.  With my new healthy diet, aren’t I allowed to fall off the wagon now and then?”  The expression “to  fall off the wagon” means to resume a bad habit, to start doing something that yo u stopped doing such as, for example, smoking.  If you say, “I’m going to stop smoki ng,” and then two months later you have a cigarette, you’ve fallen off the wagon.  This is often used for people who are alcoholic, stop drinking, but then a  few weeks, or months, or even years later they start drinking again.  They fall of f the wagon.

Now let’s listen to the story, this time at a normal spe ed.

 [start of story]

On my way home from work, I stopped at the supermarket.  My doctor has been telling me to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, so I  finally decided to follow her advice.  I resolved to eat better, so I could feel better.  I made a beeline for the produce department.

First, I looked for some bananas.  Since they ripen off t he vine, I picked out some that were already ripe and others that were still gree n.  Next, I looked for some tomatoes.  They looked picked over, but then I saw some org anic tomatoes and decided to give those a try.  Then, I went to look for t he spinach.  I found it, but it didn’t look fresh at all.  The leaves were brown and wi lted.  I decided to pass on the spinach and checked out the mushrooms.  The mushrooms di dn’t look any better.  In fact, some were beginning to rot.  I picked  up some lettuce instead and headed for the checkout stand.

I was feeling pretty good about my new decision to eat b etter.  But then, I passed the cookie aisle.  My resolve weakened.  I spotted my favor ite type of cookies. Before I knew what I was doing, I’d put a bag of those  cookies in my cart.

I know I should be able to resist impulse buys, especially of things I’m likely to eat all in one sitting, but don’t forget, I’m eating  more fruits and vegetables.  With my new healthy diet, aren’t I allowed to fall off the  wagon now and then?

This episode is dialogue between Spiro and Nancy.  They’r e going to be talking about whether they get up early in the morning or lat e in the morning, and vocabulary related to that topic.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Spiro:  Hey, watch out!

Nancy:  Oh, I’m sorry.  I didn’t see you there.  I thoug ht I would be the only person up at the crack of dawn.  What are you doing sitti ng on the stoop at this ungodly hour?

Spiro:  I’m trying to turn over a new leaf.

Nancy:  What do you mean?

Spiro:  I’m in the habit of staying up until all hour s of the night.  I hardly ever get enough sleep and walk around all day sleep-deprived.  I’ m trying to see if I can make the switch from being a night owl to an early rise r.  I’m hoping the new hours will make me a changed man.

Nancy:  That sounds very commendable, but that still doesn’ t answer my question.  What are you doing sitting out here?

Spiro:  I’m waiting for the coffee shop to open.

Nancy:  Can you eat breakfast this early in the morning?

 Spiro:  No, but I can drink coffee, lots and lots of coff ee.

Nancy:  You’ll definitely be the first one in line.

Spiro:  I guess what they say is true: the early bird get s the worm.

Nancy:  I don’t know about worms, but the early bird wil l definitely get the first dose of caffeine!

[end of dialogue]

Spiro begins by saying, “Hey, watch out!”  “Watch out” me ans be careful; it’s a phrase we use to warn someone who is in danger, to tell  someone when something bad might happen to them.  We’re telling t hem to be careful – watch out.  Nancy says, “Oh, I’m sorry.  I didn’t see you there.   I thought I would be the only person up at the crack of dawn.”  “To be up at the  crack (crack) of dawn (dawn)” means to be awake and out of your bed at a very early hour, very early in the morning.  The “dawn” is the beginning of the day, the beginning of the morning.

“What are you doing sitting on the stoop at this ungodl y hour?”  Nancy is asking Spiro why he is sitting on the stoop (stoop).  A “stoop” is an area outside the front door of some homes or some apartment buildings in the city, usually with several steps that lead down to the sidewalk.  We often associate this with buildings – apartment buildings, especially in older cities on the Ea st Coast, but you can have a stoop anywhere.  “Stoop” has, believe it or not, other meanings as well, and those can be found in the Learning Guide.

Nancy wants to know what Spiro is doing sitting on the st oop at this ungodly hour.  The expression “an ungodly hour” means very early i n the morning when most people are asleep.  It’s sometimes used either to b e funny or to express the idea that it is too early for people to be up and awa ke and sitting on stoops.

Spiro says, “I’m trying to turn over a new leaf (leaf).”   The expression “to turn over a new leaf” means to begin a new phase – a new pa rt of your life by changing your behavior in some way.  “I used to always eat  McDonald hamburgers for lunch.  But today I’m going to turn ove r a new leaf, I’m going to have Burger King hamburgers instead!”  See, I’ve changed  my behavior.  I’m joking, of course; that’s not a changing your behavior if you’re going from one restaurant to another eating the same thing.  “To tur n a new leaf” would be to

 start eating something different – something healthy.  “To turn over a new leaf” means to go from doing something usually not good to d oing something good.

Nancy says, “What do you mean?” and Spiro says, “I’m in the habit of staying up until all hours of the night.”  “To be in the habit  of (something)” means to be accustomed to or used to doing something: “Many Americans a re in the habit of eating a small breakfast.”  That’s something they usually do.  “To stay up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to not go to bed, to r emain awake until it is very late at night when most people are already sleeping.  “All hours of the night” is a phrase that means throughout the night, going from pe rhaps 10:00 at night until 5:00 in the morning or 7:00 in the morning.  Colleg e students preparing for an exam may study all hours of the night.  They’ll not good  to sleep the day before they have their exam – which is probably not a good idea  actually!

Well, Spiro says that he is in the habit of (he’s used t o) staying up until all hours of the night.  He says, “I hardly ever get enough sleep a nd walk around all day sleep-deprived.”  To be “sleep-deprived” means to be very tired because you have not had enough sleep.  “To deprive” (deprive) mean s to withhold or not give someone something.  In this case, you’re not giving yourse lf enough sleep.  He says, “I’m trying to see if I can make the switch from b eing a night owl to an early riser.”  “To make the switch” means to begin to do someth ing differently, to change to something else; “I used to buy all of my clothin g at the store, now I’m going to make the switch and buy it online.”  Spiro says t hat he wants to make the switch from being a night owl to an early riser.  A  “night owl “ (owl) is a person who enjoys being awake very late at night, someone who f eels that they have more energy at night; they like staying up late.  An “ow l” is a bird that is often awake at night, or at least that’s what people think, so  a night owl is someone who stays up late.  The opposite of a night owl would b e an early riser (riser). “To rise” means to get up.  To be an “early riser” (w ith an “r” at the end) means to be a person who gets up early.  So, he wants to become a  person who instead of being a night owl is an early riser.  He says, “I’m hop ing the new hours will make me a changed man.”  “To be a changed man,” or a “chan ged woman,” means that you have had a major or very important change in yo ur life, a transformation, something that has made you a better person.

Nancy says, “That sounds very commendable.”  Something that i s “commendable” means it is admirable, it is good, it’s som ething that’s very impressive that people should congratulate you for.  Nancy says this is commendable, “but that still doesn’t answer my question.   What are you doing sitting out here (on the stoop)?”  Spiro says, “I’m wait ing for the coffee shop to open.”  He wants to go buy some coffee, so he wants to wait until the coffee shop

 (the store where they sell coffee) is open.  Nancy says, “Ca n you eat breakfast this early in the morning?”  Spiro says, “No, but I can drink coffee, lots and lots of coffee.”  Coffee, of course, has caffeine in it, which i s a chemical that will make you stay awake.

Nancy says, “You’ll definitely be the first one in line,” meaning the first one there when the store opens.  Spiro says, “I guess what they say is true: the early bird gets the worm.”  This is an old expression: “The early bi rd gets the worm.”  It means that people who wake up early are more successful beca use they can take advantage of opportunities that are not available to other people, or they can get to places early and get more things done.  Or, if  for example, a store is having a sale – a very popular sale, and you go early in t he morning you’re more likely to get that thing that you want to buy.  Later i n the day, the store may not have any more left.  So, the early bird gets the worm.  A “worm” is a small, little animal that crawls on the ground; it’s something that b irds – many birds eat. They go down to the ground and they pick up these worms a nd they eat them. The word “early bird,” or the term “early bird” also m eans the same as an early riser, so you could say “I’m an early bird.”  That means I get up early.

Nancy says, “I don’t know about worms, but the early bird w ill definitely get the first dose of caffeine!”  A “dose” (dose) is the amount of a drug or a medicine that you are supposed to take.  Nancy is making sort of a joke here.  Caffeine, she’s saying, is a drug that Spiro needs – that Spiro is going  to take when he drinks his coffee.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Spiro:  Hey, watch out!

Nancy:  Oh, I’m sorry.  I didn’t see you there.  I thoug ht I would be the only person up at the crack of dawn.  What are you doing sitti ng on the stoop at this ungodly hour?

Spiro:  I’m trying to turn over a new leaf.

Nancy:  What do you mean?

Spiro:  I’m in the habit of staying up until all hour s of the night.  I hardly ever get enough sleep and walk around all day sleep-deprived.  I’ m trying to see if I can

 make the switch from being a night owl to an early rise r.  I’m hoping the new hours will make me a changed man.

Nancy:  That sounds very commendable, but that still doesn’ t answer my question.  What are you doing sitting out here?

Spiro:  I’m waiting for the coffee shop to open.

# Using Unfair Influence

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 76: Using Unfair Influence.

This episode is called “Using Unfair Influence.”  Let’s g et started.

[start of dialogue]

Josey:  Hello, I’m Josey Kim.

Curt:  Hi, I’m Curt West.  Thanks for agreeing to meet  with me.

Josey:  You mentioned on the phone that you can help us get that government contract we’re bidding on, is that right?

Curt:  Absolutely.  I’m sure I can be of service to your com pany and secure that contract without too much difficulty.

Josey:  I appreciate your confidence, but can you tell me  more about how you plan to do that?

Curt:  I think the less said the better.  Let’s just say that I have friends in high places.

Josey:  I’m not sure I understand you.

Curt:  Come on, you know how business is done on Capitol Hill.  If you line the right pockets, it’s not difficult to pull some strings to get what you want.

 Josey:  Are you suggesting that our company use bribery to g et preferential treatment on our bid?

Curt:  I’m simply saying that backroom deals are business as usual in the government.

Josey:  If you’re suggesting that we hire you to do influe nce peddling, I can tell you now that we’re not interested.  Corruption may be rampant in government, but we’re not willing to do anything unethical to get  a contract.

Curt:  Suit yourself, but without somebody like me doing your dirty work, there’s no way you’re going to win that contract.

Josey:  That may be, Mr. West, but that’s a chance we’re wi lling to take.

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Josey saying, “Hello, I’m Josey Ki m.”  Curt says, “Hi, I’m Curt West.  Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.”  Josey says, “You mentioned on the phone that you can help us get that g overnment contract we’re bidding on, is that right?”  A “contract” is a legal a greement between two people or two groups, where one of the “parties,” as they’re ca lled – one of the people or the groups agrees to give something, to do something for the other group or person, and that other party gives them money or somethin g else of value.

Josey is talking about a government contract that her busin ess is bidding on.  “To bid” (bid) means to offer to do something, in this case  for a particular amount of money.  Often the government has work that it needs done , and it has businesses do that work.  But the businesses have to bid; th ey have to say, “I’ll do it for this much,” “I’ll do it for that much,” and then the government picks the best bid, sometimes the cheapest or the one that will d o the most for the money. “To bid” has other meanings in English as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for those.

Curt says, “Absolutely,” meaning yes, we can help you get th at government contract.  He says, “I’m sure I can be of service to your com pany and secure that contract without too much difficulty.”  “To be of service t o (someone)” means to be useful, to be helpful to that person.  “To secure” h ere means to get, to obtain. “Secure” has other meanings in English; those – guess wha t – are in the Learning Guide.

 Josey says, “I appreciate your confidence, but can you tell me more about how you plan to do that?”  So Josey wants to know how Curt ca n help her company get this government contract, and Curt says, “I think the l ess said the better.” This expression, or phrase, “the less said the better,” is used to indicate that you don’t want to give a lot of information – a lot of d etails about something, perhaps because the details would be about something bad, unet hical, immoral, or wrong in some way, and the other person doesn’t need to know t hat information. Sometimes the phrase is simply used to mean that I don’t want to talk about it or that’s not something we want to talk about because, perh aps, it’s embarrassing to someone: “The less said the better.”

Curt says, “Let’s just say that I have friends in high place s.”  “To have friends in high places” means that you have personal or professional relationships with people who have a lot of power.  Perhaps you know the g overnor of your state.  If I knew our current Governor Schwarzenegger I would say th at I have friends in high places.

Josey says, “I’m not sure I understand you.”  Curt says, “Com e on (meaning be reasonable; don’t joke with me), you know how business is d one on Capitol Hill.” Capitol Hill is in Washington, D.C.; it’s where the bu ilding – the Capitol Building is located, where you have the U.S. Representatives and the  U.S. Senators.  They meet in the Capitol Building, so when someone says Capit ol Hill, they’re referring to the Senate and the House of Representatives, or sim ply the Congress, which is another word for those two groups.

Curt says, “If you line the right pockets, it’s not difficu lt to pull some strings to get what you want.”  “To line (line) the right pockets” me ans to give money to powerful people so that they will make a particular de cision or take a particular view on something.  You’re basically influencing them ill egally – unethically – by giving them money.  This is a type of what we would call more generally “corruption,” where people in the government are takin g money, or houses or vacations or whatever, in exchange for making certain decisio ns to help the people who gave him or her that money.  That’s what it  means to line someone’s pockets.  He says, “it’s not difficult to pull some strings t o get what you want.” The phrase “to pull some strings” means to do something i n secret, something unusual, perhaps unethical to influence a person or a  situation.  It doesn’t always have to be something that is illegal.  “To pull some st rings” means simply to use your influence – your power to get something done.  But  with Curt, we kind of think it is unethical!

 Josey says, “Are you suggesting that our company use bribery to get preferential treatment on our bid?”  “Bribery” (bribery) is the i llegal practice of giving money to politicians or other decision-makers to make them do wha t you want to do, so it’s to line someone’s pockets, as we said earlier.  That’s br ibery, and the verb is “to bribe.”  “Preferential treatment” means someone is going to be favorable toward you; they’re going to make decisions that help you or your  organization.  Again, if this is done because they received a bribe then that woul d be illegal and unethical.

Curt says, “I’m simply saying that backroom deals are business a s usual in the government.”  A “backroom (one word) deal” is an agree ment that happens in secret, without people knowing about it, certainly witho ut the general public – the average person knowing about it.  “Business as usual” here means the way things have always been done in this particular kind of bu siness or in this type of organization, in this case the government.  Curt is saying  that the government always has these secret agreements – these secret deals, that ’s business as usual – as normal.

Josey says, “If you’re suggesting that we hire you to do infl uence peddling, I can tell you now we’re not interested.”  “Influence peddli ng” (peddling) is, again, the illegal practice of using your authority or your power as a way to get money or favors from other people.  Josey is saying that her company is not going to give Curt money so that he can go bribe government officials.  She says, “Corruption may be rampant in government, but we’re not willing to do anything unethical to get a contract.”  “Corruption” is, as we mentioned befo re, dishonest behavior by people who have a lot of power, especially governments.  “Rampant” (rampant) means very common, not unusual; often a negative thing t hat’s very common. “Unethical” means wrong, immoral, often illegal.  But  unethical doesn’t necessarily mean it’s illegal, but it does mean that it’s wrong; it’s against the common understanding of right and wrong.

Curt says, “Suit yourself,” meaning you can do what you wa nt to do; I don’t care. “Suit yourself, but without somebody like me doing your d irty work, there’s no way you’re going to win that contract.”  “Dirty work” her e means doing things that are not pleasant, perhaps are wrong, but that you are going to have to do.  Curt says that if you don’t do this – if you don’t bribe the g overnment officials – you won’t win the contract; the contract will not be given t o you.  Josey says, “That may be, Mr. West (that may be correct, she means), but tha t’s a chance we’re willing to take,” meaning that’s a risk that we are wil ling to take.  Perhaps we won’t get the contract, but we won’t do anything illeg al or unethical.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Josey:  Hello, I’m Josey Kim.

Curt:  Hi, I’m Curt West.  Thanks for agreeing to meet  with me.

Josey:  You mentioned on the phone that you can help us get that government contract we’re bidding on, is that right?

# Magic and Illusions

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 77: Magic and Illusions.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 577.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the beautiful City of Los Angeles, in the State of California.

Go to our website today at eslpod.com.  In fact, go th ere right now – I’ll stop and wait!  When you’re there, you’ll see that you can downl oad a Learning Guide for this episode that will help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is a dialogue between Patricia and Sergio about magic, about people doing tricks that make you think that they have specia l powers.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia:  This is the best magic show I’ve ever seen.  Have  you ever seen so many amazing magic tricks in your life?  They’re blowing m y mind!

Sergio:  They’re all just illusions.  It’s nothing but smoke and mirrors.

Patricia:  I don’t know how you can say that.  We’ve seen  some really impressive sleight of hand tricks and that escape artist seemed to do the impossible.

Sergio:  Couldn’t you see that it was just misdirection?   While you weren’t looking, the magician left through the trap door.

Patricia:  Maybe that’s how that trick was done, but how do you explain the mind reader?  How did he know what I was thinking if he coul dn’t really read my mind?

Sergio:  I’m sure any supernatural powers these magicians and entertainers claim to have have been debunked by somebody.  Maybe he use d the power of suggestion.  Who knows?

Patricia:  And maybe you’re just jaded.

Sergio:  And maybe you’re the most gullible person who ever lived!

 [end of dialogue]

Patricia says to Sergio, “This is the best magic show I’ve eve r seen.”  A “magic show” is a type of entertainment where there is a perfo rmer, what we call a “magician,” who appears to do things that are impossible .  Patricia says, “Have you ever seen so many amazing magic tricks in your life?”  A “magic trick” is something that this magician does that appears impossible.   For example, perhaps there’s a woman in a box, and they separate the  box, and you think that the woman has been cut into two pieces.  But of course, she hasn’t – or has she? Patricia says these magic tricks are blowing her mind.  “To blow one’s mind” means to make someone feel very surprised or excited or impr essed: “I heard her play the violin last night at the concert and it bl ew my mind.  She was amazing.”

Sergio says, “They’re all just illusions.”  An “illusion” i s something that appears different than how it actually is.  You think you’re seei ng one thing, but really you’re seeing something else.  Sergio says, “It’s nothing but smoke and mirrors.” “It’s nothing but” means all that it is is smoke and mirr ors.  The expression “smoke and mirrors” (mirrors), it’s also sometimes “blue smoke and mirrors” or just “smoke and mirrors,” they both mean the same, which i s that you are distracting people to focus their attention on somethin g else or somewhere else, so they think that what is going on is magic, but it’s just  an illusion.  “Smoke and mirrors” or “blue smoke and mirrors” is a distraction.

Patricia says, “I don’t know how you can say that.  We’ve see n some really impressive sleight of hand tricks and that escape artist seeme d to do the impossible.”  A “sleight (sleight) of hand trick” is when  your hands move very quickly, and you can’t really see what’s going on.  Magician s often have sleight of hand tricks.  More generally, the expression is sometimes use d simply to mean an illusion, a trick, something that isn’t really true bu t it looks true.  An “escape artist” is a magician – a performer, who is able to get  out of very difficult situations.  For example, the great American magician H oudini, who is probably the most famous magician in U.S. history, was known to be  a great escape artist. You could put him in a box, and put him into the ocean , and somehow he would get out the box.  Of course, these things were always pla nned, but they made it look like it was the impossible being done.

Sergio says, “Couldn’t you see that it was just misdirection ?”  “Misdirection” is distracting someone, making him or her focus on something else so while they’re looking over there, you’re doing something over here.  Then they look back, and it looks like you did something amazing or impossible, but in fact, you were just

 doing it so they couldn’t see it.  That’s misdirection, to  direct someone to the wrong place.  Sergio says, “While you weren’t looking, t he magician left through the trap (trap) door.”  A “trap door” is actually in t he floor, but you can’t see it; you don’t know it’s there.  Usually it is underneath like a p iece of carpet or a rug, and when you’re not looking someone can go down through the  trap door and it looks as though they simply escaped, but you couldn’t see how the y did it.  That’s a trap door.

Patricia says, “Maybe that’s how that trick was done, but h ow do you explain the mind reader?”  Your “mind” is what you think with.  A  “reader” is someone who can tell, in this case, what’s in your mind.  So, a “min d reader” would be someone who can say, “I know what you’re thinking.  Another word for a mind reader would be a psychic.  A “psychic” is a person who that says he or she has the power to know what other people are thinking, or even  to know what will happen in the future.  The expression “mind reader” is someti mes used in a discussion or an argument, especially between for example a husband an d a wife.  The wife will say, “Why didn’t you go to the store and buy me some flowers?” and husband will say, “Well, I didn’t think you liked flowers.  I’m n ot a mind reader.”  I can’t tell what you are thinking – I can’t see your thoughts.  And t hen the man sleeps in the living room that night – that’s usually what happen s!

Patricia says, “How did he know what I was thinking if he  couldn’t really read my mind?”  Patricia thinks that this mind reader – this mag ician was actually reading her mind, actually knew which she was thinking.  Sergio says,  “I’m sure any supernatural powers these magicians and entertainers clai m to have have been debunked by somebody.”  “Supernatural” is something that  is beyond the natural, beyond the normal, above what normal human beings can d o.  “Supernatural power” would be the ability to do something that woul d otherwise be impossible. Sergio says, “I’m sure any supernatural powers these magicia ns and entertainers claim to have (say they have) have been debunked by somebody.”   “To debunk” (debunk) means to prove that something is not true, to prove that something did not happen the way you thought it happened.  Sergio i s saying that these supernatural powers that these magicians say they have are  not really supernatural powers, that someone has shown how they do t heir tricks.  Sergio says, “Maybe he used the power of suggestion.”  “The powe r of suggestion” is when you give someone an idea – a thought, and make th em think that it was their idea to begin with so they believe it.

Patricia says, “And maybe you’re just jaded.”  “To be jad ed” (jaded) means that you have experienced something too much so that you’re no longer interested in

 it, or you no longer become excited by it.  It’s definit ely a negative expression, a negative way of describing someone to say that they’re jade d.

Sergio says, “And maybe you’re the most gullible person wh o ever lived!”  “To be gullible” (gullible) means to believe everything that o ther people say and do.  It’s, again, a negative adjective; it means that you are easily fooled, that you believe other people when you should not.  Sergio, then, is in sulting Patricia by calling her gullible.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Patricia:  This is the best magic show I’ve ever seen.  Have  you ever seen so many amazing magic tricks in your life?  They’re blowing m y mind!

Sergio:  They’re all just illusions.  It’s nothing but smoke and mirrors.

Patricia:  I don’t know how you can say that.  We’ve seen  some really impressive sleight of hand tricks and that escape artist seemed to do the impossible.

Sergio:  Couldn’t you see that it was just misdirection?   While you weren’t looking, the magician left through the trap door.

Patricia:  Maybe that’s how that trick was done, but how do you explain the mind reader?  How did he know what I was thinking if he coul dn’t really read my mind?

Sergio:  I’m sure any supernatural powers these magicians and entertainers claim to have have been debunked by somebody.  Maybe he use d the power of suggestion.  Who knows?

Patricia:  And maybe you’re just jaded.

Sergio:  And maybe you’re the most gullible person who ever lived!

[end of dialogue]

It wasn’t just an illusion. Today’s script really was writte n by Dr. Lucy Tse.  Thank you, Lucy.





# Eating a Home-Cooked Meal

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 5 78: Eating a Home-Cooked Meal.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 578.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  If you want to support this p odcast to keep our audio files free please consider making a donation on our websi te or becoming an ESL Podcast member.

This episode is a dialogue between Louise and Gil.  The y are talking about eating a meal at home and some of the vocabulary that m ight be connected to that activity.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Louise:  What’s the matter with you?

Gil:  I just got off the phone with my mom and she says t hey’re planning a welcome-home party for me next week – at a restaurant!

Louise:  What’s wrong with that?

Gil:  After living abroad for a year, I was really loo king forward to a home-cooked meal.

Louise:  Why didn’t you just tell your mother that?

Gil:  I didn’t have the heart to do that.  She was so  excited about the party, and who am I to tell her she has to slave over a hot stove to cook me a lavish dinner?

Louise:  I’m sure she wouldn’t mind.  It’d be a labo r of love.

Gil:  You don’t know my mother.  She doesn’t cut corner s and makes everything from scratch.  She uses these recipes that were passed down to her from her mother.  She can make the most intricate dishes, but what  I’m craving are the comfort foods she always made for us when we were kids.  It  makes my mouth water just thinking about her cooking.

 Louise:  After a year of living on instant noodles and t ake-out food, I’m not surprised you want something home-cooked.  I tell you what .  After the party, come over to my house and I’ll have a home-cooked meal ready for you.

Gil:  You, cook for me?  Thanks, but no thanks!

[end of dialogue]

Louise begins by saying to Gil, “What’s the matter with you?” meaning what is wrong with you.  Gil says, “I just got off the phone wit h my mom and she says they’re planning a welcome-home party for me next week –  at a restaurant!”  So, Gil says he just got off the phone, meaning he just fini shed talking to his mother, and his mother says that they (his family) is planning a w elcome-home party for him.  “Welcome home” is when someone goes away and then comes back home.  If they’ve been gone a long time you might have a welcome-home party. But this party is going to be at a restaurant.  Louise sa ys, “What’s wrong with that?”  Gil says, “After living abroad for a year, I w as really looking forward to a home-cooked meal.”  “To live abroad” means to live in a nother country; sometimes people say “to live overseas.”  That’s popular in  the United States, meaning you have to cross the ocean – cross the Atlantic o r Pacific and live in another place.  But that’s not always the case; you can live  abroad by moving to Canada for example.

Gil says that he was really looking forward, after having been away from his country and his family for a year, to a “home-cooked meal ,” a meal – a lunch or a dinner – that is prepared at home.  Louise says, “Why d idn’t you just tell your mother that?”  Gil says, “I didn’t have the heart to do  that.”  If someone says they “don’t have the heart to do (something)” they mean t hey don’t want to say something or do something because they think it will hur t another person’s feelings – it will make that other person feel bad.  Gil says his mom “was so excited about the party, and who am I to tell her she h as to slave over a hot stove to cook me a lavish dinner?”  “Who am I to tell her (me ans how can I tell her; what right do I have to tell her) to slave over a hot stove?”  A “stove” (stove) is what you have in the kitchen; you use it to put pans on a nd then you light a fire underneath, or have some sort of heat coming from bel ow and you cook things inside of the pan.  “To slave (slave) over (something)” m eans to work very hard at something.  A “slave” is a person who is owned by anoth er person. Fortunately in the United States there is no more slaver y; we don’t have any slaves, at least not legally.  But the expression “to slave o ver” means to work

 very hard at something, and this is a common way of using i t: “to slave over a hot stove.”

He doesn’t want his mother to slave over a hot stove just co ok him a lavish dinner.  “Lavish” (lavish) is something that is very fancy; i t could be something very expensive.  We could talk about giving your wife a lavi sh Christmas gift or birthday gift.  “Lavish” would be expensive, it would be  nice, and I would highly recommend it!  But here, it means a meal that perhaps  had many different ingredients that was very difficult to make.

Louise says, “I’m sure your mother wouldn’t mind,” meanin g it would not bother her.  “It would be,” she says, “a labor of love.”  The e xpression “a labor of love” means doing something difficult or that takes a lot of time, but you do it because you love the other person.  You want to show the other  person how much you love them by doing this particular thing.  So it’s diffi cult, yes, but you’re doing it because you love this person.

Gil says, “You don’t know my mother.  She doesn’t cut corne rs and makes everything from scratch.”  “To cut corners” is an expression th at means to do something the easy way.  “To take shortcuts” is another exp ression that means the same thing.  If you cut corners, usually the final re sult is not as good as it could have been.  You are not doing everything you’re sup posed to do.  Well, his mother does not cut corners; she makes everything from scratch .  To cook or to make some particular food “from scratch” (scratch) means tha t you don’t use any canned good, you don’t use any food that has already be en prepared; you just start with the basic ingredients and you mix them togeth er and you cook them or prepare them for the meal.  There’s no going to the grocery store and buying something in a bottle or a can.  Everything is done from  the original ingredients; that’s making something from scratch.  “Scratch” has a coupl e of other meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for this episode that will give you some additional explanations.

Gil says that his mother uses these recipes that were passed d own to her from her mother, Gil’s grandmother.  A “recipe” is a writte n set of instructions – of steps – that tells you how to make a certain kind of food , what we would call a certain “dish,” which is the thing that you are preparin g made from other ingredients – from other things.  His mother got these  recipes that she uses from her mother; they were passed down to her.  To “pass down ” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to give something to someone in the  next generation.  So when a father gives his son his wedding ring, or gives hi s daughter some

 important book that has been part of the family for ma ny years, that’s to pass something down.  Usually it’s something valuable, at least  to the family.

Gil says his mother “can make the most intricate dishes, b ut what I’m craving are the comfort foods she always made for us when we were kids. ”  Something that is “intricate” (intricate) is very complicated, very complex, a  lot of details, a lot of ingredients in order to make that particular kind of f ood – that dish.  But Gil doesn’t want an intricate dish, he’s “craving,” meaning  he has a very strong sense of wanting, particularly food – he’s craving comfort food.  “Comfort food” is food that is very familiar to you, often it’s the kind of food that you ate as a child, and so eating it again makes you feel comfortable.  It makes you feel like you were a child, innocent and protected, things that would  make you feel comfortable.  Chicken noodle soup is for some people comfo rt food.  For me, comfort food would, hmm, probably be a jelly sandwich – yes, that’s a comfort food!

Gil says that it makes my mouth water just thinking about h er cooking.  “To make your mouth water” means that when you think of a parti cular food it starts to make you feel hungry, and when you start to feel hungry your mouth begins to what we call “salivate,” it fills with water.  So, some thing that makes your mouth water is something that is very good tasting, something t hat is delicious.

Louise says that after a year of living on instant noodles and take-out food, I’m not surprised you want something home-cooked.  “Instant” means immediate. When we talk about “instant” with food, we’re talking  about food that can be prepared in a very short period of time.  For example, a food that’s very popular especially among college students because it’s cheap is ram en noodles, at least here in Los Angeles.  Ramen noodles is a Japanese food, b ut it can be prepared very quickly if you buy the noodles already prepared in a p ackage at the store. So instant noodles would be that kind of food; you pour  hot water in it and you can you eat it.  “Take-out food” is food that you buy fro m a restaurant and bring back to your home, you don’t eat it at the restaurant.  In the U.S., that’s called take-out food.

Louise says, “I tell you what.”  “I tell you what” is a p hrase you use when you are proposing or suggesting an idea to another person.  You  can also say “I’ll tell you what,” both of those are possible.  Louise says, “After t he party (the coming home party – the welcome-home party), come over to my ho use and I’ll have a home-cooked meal ready for you.”  Gil says, “You, cook for m e?  Thanks, but no thanks!”  “Thanks, but no thanks” means you appreciate the person offering or suggesting to do something for you, but you don’t want to do it.  It’s often used

 somewhat sarcastically or humorously to say I don’t really wan t to do that at all, that’s not a good thing that you are offering me

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Louise:  What’s the matter with you?

Gil:  I just got off the phone with my mom and she says t hey’re planning a welcome-home party for me next week – at a restaurant!

Louise:  What’s wrong with that?

Gil:  After living abroad for a year, I was really loo king forward to a home-cooked meal.

Louise:  Why didn’t you just tell your mother that?

Gil:  I didn’t have the heart to do that.  She was so  excited about the party, and who am I to tell her she has to slave over a hot stove to cook me a lavish dinner?

# Telling People Where You¡¦re From

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 79: Telling People Where You’re From.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 579.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You probably already know that , but did you know that we also have an ESL Podcast Store, where you can buy additional courses in English?  Yeah?  And our ESL Podcast Blog, where a couple of times a week we provide even more help in improving your English.

This episode is called “Telling People Where You’re Fro m.”  The U.S. is a land of immigrants (people from other countries), but also a co untry where people move to different parts of the country frequently.  This is go ing to tell you how you tell someone where you came from before you got to where you  are now.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Cora:  Hi, I’m Cora.

Antonio:  I’m Antonio.  Nice to meet you.

Cora:  Same here.  Are you from around here?

Antonio:  No, I’m originally from Arkansas.  How about  you?

Cora:  I’m a native Californian, but I grew up in the Middle East.  My parents were in the military, so we moved quite a bit, but mainly a round the Middle East.

Antonio:  That’s really interesting.  I spent some time in Jordan myself a few years ago doing research for my company.  But I’ve lived in Los Angeles for over 10 years and consider it my adopted hometown.

Cora:  Isn’t that funny?  Even though I was born here, I only moved back here two months ago.  I’m sure you know the city much better th an I do.

Antonio:  I’d be happy to show you around, to help you get reacquainted with L.A.

 Cora:  I was only eight years old when my family moved aw ay, so I have a lot of catching up to do.

Antonio:  Let’s start next weekend.  I’ll show you some of the places where the locals like to hang out.

Cora:  That sounds great.  Is this how all Angelinos tr eat newcomers?

Antonio:  Absolutely!  I’m the city’s one-man welcome wag on.

[end of dialogue]

Cora begins our dialogue by saying, “Hi, I’m Cora (my n ame is Cora).”  Antonio says, “I’m Antonio.  Nice to meet you.”  Cora says, “Same  here,” which is an informal way of saying nice to me you, too: “Same here.  Are you from around here?”  “To be from around here” means from that loca l area, born in this particular town or city.  So if someone says after meeting  me, “Are you from around here?” meaning Los Angeles, I would have to say, “No.”

Antonio says, “No.”  He says, “I’m originally from Arkansas. ”  Arkansas is a state in the central part of the United States, south of Misso uri, north of Texas I think. Arkansas is where Antonio is originally from.  “Originall y from” means the place where you were born.  Usually we say that when you haven ’t spent a lot of time in your new location.  But even now, I’ve been in Los An geles almost 20 years, if someone asks me where I was originally from I would say St.  Paul, Minnesota.

So, Antonio is originally from Arkansas.  Cora says, “I’m a  native Californian.” “To be native to (some location)” means to have been bor n in that particular place.  In California, most of people who live here – well maybe not most – a lot of the people who live here are not native California ns.  They weren’t born in California; they came from other states or other countri es.  “Native” has a couple of other meanings in English as well, and those are i n your Learning Guide for this episode.

Cora says, “I grew up in the Middle East.”  So she was bo rn in California, but she “grew up,” she spent her childhood in another place – i n the Middle East, referring to the part of the world that is southeast of Europe, northwest of Africa: places like Iraq and Iran and Israel.  Those are countri es in the Middle East. Well, Cora says that her parents were in the military (t he army, or the navy, or the marines), so we moved quite a bit, but mainly aro und the Middle East.  This

 is not unusual for military families; they get assigned t o different places in the world, sometimes frequently.  In this case, Cora moved “qu ite a bit,” meaning a lot.

Antonio says, “That’s really interesting.  I spent some tim e in Jordan myself a few years ago doing research for my company.”  “To spend some ti me” means to do something for an amount of time, usually not very long , but you don’t say exactly how much: “I’m going to spend some time working on my e mail this afternoon,” maybe 10 minutes, maybe an hour.  Or, “I spent some tim e in New York City.”  A couple days, a week, could be longer, you’re not really sur e.

Antonio says that he spent some time in Jordan, which is an other country in the Middle East, “But I’ve lived in Los Angeles for over 10 y ears and I consider it my adopted hometown.”  Your “hometown” technically is the  place where you were born, so my hometown is St. Paul.  Your “adopted homet own” is another city that you move to that perhaps you love so much that you say, “Wel l, this is my hometown now.”  I’m going to adopt it, like you woul d adopt a child I guess or a puppy.  I don’t know why you would adopt a puppy, but – well, a cat.  Why you would adopt a cat I have no idea!  But this is differen t; this is adopted hometown.

Cora says, “Isn’t that funny (isn’t that interesting)?  Eve n though I was born here, I only moved back here two months ago.  I’m sure you know the city much better than I do.”  So Cora has been away for all these years, and she’s now coming back to Los Angeles.  Antonio, obviously interested romanti cally in Cora, says, “I’d be happy to show you around, to help you get reac quainted with L.A.”  “To show (someone) around” means to take someone to differe nt parts of the city, or to help someone become familiar with the most importan t things or places.  If you come to Los Angeles, I could show you around.  I could take  you to the beach, I could take you to downtown, to Disneyland, tell you where  the good restaurants are, and so forth.  That’s to show someone around.  Thi s verb “to show” has a couple of different meanings however.  This meaning, i n this dialogue, is a phrasal verb; for some other examples with different mea nings take a look at the Learning Guide.

Antonio says he can help Cora get reacquainted.  “To be  acquainted with (something)” is to know something, to have some informat ion about something or to know someone, but perhaps not very well.  “To get rea cquainted” means that you are going to try to become familiar again with some one that you knew a long time ago, or some place that you were in a long time a go, and that is the case with Cora.  Antonio is going to help her learn again  about Los Angeles.

 Cora says, well, “I was only eight years old when my family moved away (moved out of L.A.), so I have a lot of catching up to do.”  T he expression “to have a lot of catching up to do” means that you need to learn a lot of things in order to become as familiar with something as the other person is, or you need to learn all about these things that have happened when you were go ne.  “To catch up” is a phrasal verb that in this case means to get up to the sam e level of knowledge as another person after being gone for some reason.  If  you watch a television series and you miss a couple of weeks, you may ask your friend  to tell you what happened so you can catch up.

Well, Cora has a lot of catching up to do because she’s be en away from Los Angeles for so long.  Antonio says, seeing an opportunit y, “Let’s start next weekend.  I’ll show you some of the places where the local s like to hang out.”  A “local,” as a noun, is a person who lives in that area.  It’s especially a term that you will hear in places where there are lots of tourists.   There are the people who come and visit, and then there are the locals, the peopl e who actually live there.

So Antonio is going to show Cora where the locals like t o hang out.  “To hang out” is a phrasal verb meaning to spend your free time – your leisure time doing things that are fun but aren’t necessarily important.  G oing with your friends to a café or to a restaurant, those are places where you hang out.  It can also be used as a noun; a “hangout” is a place where a particular gr oup of people often go to. That term is especially popular when we are talking abo ut adolescents, high school, and college kids.

Cora says to Antonio, “That sounds great.  Is this how all  Angelinos treat newcomers?”  “Angelino” is someone like me, who lives in  Los Angeles.  “To treat (someone)” is to act toward someone in a particu lar way, to behave towards someone: “You should treat other people nicely,” you shou ld be nice to them. Or, “He treated his dog very badly,” he wasn’t very nice to  his dog.  Maybe the dog wasn’t very nice to him!  A “newcomer” (one word - n ewcomer) is a person who is new to an area, someone who has lived somewhere e lse and now has come to live in this particular town or city.

So, Cora is asking if all Angelinos treat newcomers, like her, so nicely.  Antonio says, “Absolutely!  I’m the city’s one-man welcome wagon.”  One-man” means one person doing something alone; not necessarily a man , could be a woman.  A “welcome wagon” is a service, if you will, that welcomes pe ople who have recently moved to a new area.  There isn’t really anythin g like a welcome wagon in modern America.  But sometimes when you move to a new  city, the local businesses might send you flyers – might send you advertisement s; your

 neighbors, perhaps, might come up and talk to you and g reet you.  That would be sort of the idea of a welcome wagon.  A “wagon” (wago n) is like a big a big cart that would be pulled by a horse for example, or it coul d be pulled by humans, and you ride inside of it.  If you think back in the 19th century in the U.S., when people were coming from the east coast of the U.S. out to the  west, out to places like California, they had horses and the horses pulled this m ode of transportation called a wagon.  It has four wheels on it; usually the w agon was “covered,” meaning there was a top to it.  That’s a wagon.

Of course, Antonio is not really being nice to Cora just because he’s nice to newcomers.  We get the idea maybe he has some romantic i nterest in Cora!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Cora:  Hi, I’m Cora.

Antonio:  I’m Antonio.  Nice to meet you.

Cora:  Same here.  Are you from around here?

Antonio:  No, I’m originally from Arkansas.  How about  you?

Cora:  I’m a native Californian, but I grew up in the Middle East.  My parents were in the military, so we moved quite a bit, but mainly a round the Middle East.

Antonio:  That’s really interesting.  I spent some time in Jordan myself a few years ago doing research for my company.  But I’ve lived in Los Angeles for over 10 years and consider it my adopted hometown.

# Retiring From a Job

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 80: Retiring From a Job.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 580.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can improve your English eve n faster by getting the Learning Guide for this episode on our website.

This episode is called “Retiring From a Job.”  When you l eave your job when you get older – 55-60-65 – you stop working, you retire.  A nd this is going to be a dialogue between Meredith and Oscar that will include a lot of vocabulary we associate with retirement.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Meredith:  Are you going to Stanley’s retirement party?

Oscar:  Sure, I want a glimpse of the future.  I can’t wait to retire.

Meredith:  It’ll be a long time before you get the g olden handshake.  Me?  I may be ready for early retirement.

Oscar:  Are you seriously thinking about taking the early re tirement package the company is offering?

Meredith:  I’m thinking about it.  My health isn’t get ting any better, and I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in this office.

Oscar:  But can you afford it?

Meredith:  The early retirement package is pretty genero us, and I’ve saved up a nice little nest egg over the years.

Oscar:  Then what are you waiting for?  If I were in yo ur shoes, I wouldn’t hem and haw about it.  I’d make the decision to retire now  – today!

Meredith:  Why are you getting all worked up?  Are you after my job?

 Oscar:  No way!  I just can’t stand to see someone who can retire stay at this job. I’d trade places with you in a minute.

Meredith:  I doubt that – not if it meant being a ca rd-carrying member of AARP. You’re too young to be thinking about retirement.

Oscar:  I didn’t say I was ready for retirement.  I’m j ust thinking about it – all the time!

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Meredith asking Oscar, “Are yo u going to Stanley’s retirement party?”  A “retirement party” is, of course,  for someone who is “retiring,” meaning they are leaving their job.  They’ re no longer going to work anymore, not just at that job, but typically at any job when you retire as you get older.  Oscar says, “Sure, I want a glimpse of the future .”  A “glimpse” (glimpse) is a very quick look at something.  We might say a brief “g lance” (glance), which is another word for a very rapid or quick look.  Oscar wan ts a glimpse of the future, to know what his life will be like perhaps when  he retires.  He says, “I can’t wait to retire.”

Meredith says, “It’ll be a long time before you get the  golden handshake.”  A “handshake” is when two people put their hands together  and move them up and down.  “To shake someone’s hand” is what we would say as a  verb.  “Golden” refers, in this case, to a lot of money, and a “golden h andshake” is when a company pays one of its employees extra money to encourage t hem to retire. Because older employees are usually being paid a lot more , it is often cheaper for a company to encourage them to retire – to leave th eir job – than it is to have them continue working for them.  So, a golden handshake  is an “incentive,” something that is given to you to make you want to do some thing else.

Meredith says, “Me?  I may be ready for early retirement. ”  “Early retirement” is when you retire before the normal age; typically in the U.S. it’s 65 years old. Oscar says, “Are you seriously thinking about taking the earl y retirement package the company is offering?”  A “package” here means a coll ection of things, a set (set) of things.  A “retirement package” may include mone y; it may include other things that will get the person to retire early.  Agai n, early retirement is sometimes encouraged by companies in order to get older e mployees, more expensive employees, to leave the company early.

 Meredith is thinking about the early retirement package.   “Package,” I should say, also has other meanings in English, and those meanings are found in your Learning Guide.  Meredith says, “My health isn’t gettin g any better,” meaning I continue to get sicker and sicker, or at least I’m not ge tting more healthy.  “I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in this office.”  “The  rest of my days” would mean here the rest of my life.  Oscar asks, “But can you aff ord it?” meaning will you have enough money: “can you afford it?”  Meredith sa ys, “The early retirement package is pretty generous.”  It’s very genero us.  Someone who is “generous” (generous) is someone who is willing to share  things with you; it can also refer to more than expected amounts of money.  If everyone in the office donates 10 dollars to some charity and you decide to don ate 1,000 dollars, they would say, “Wow, that’s a very generous donation.”

Meredith says that the early retirement package is pretty  generous, “and,” she says, “I’ve saved up a nice little nest egg over the years.”  “To save up” is a two- word phrasal verb that means usually to save money for a p articular purpose or for a particular thing that you want to buy: “I’m saving  up my money to buy the iPad.”  Or, “I’m saving up my money to take a trip to F iji.”  That would be an example of to save up.  Well, you should also, I hope, sa ve up for your retirement.  At least if you live in the United State s and do not work for the government, you usually have to take care of yourself mostly, and that’s why you need to save up.  The “up” is just a word of emphasis, a s it is often in these two- word phrasal verbs.

Meredith says that she saved up a nice little nest egg.  A “nest egg” (two words) is money that you save for your retirement, money that y ou will use when you are no longer working.  Why do we say nest egg?  An “egg” co ntains a bird that is not yet born – not yet developed.  A “nest” is the place whe re the bird keeps his or her eggs – well, her eggs.  He doesn’t have eggs; only the female has eggs I think.  So a nest egg, then, refers to eggs that you wo uld have saved and guarded and protected, like a bird would protect her eggs.

Oscar says, “Then what are you waiting for?”  He’s asking Me redith why she doesn’t just retire now.  “If I were in your shoes, I wo uldn’t hem and haw about it.” When you say, “if I were in your shoes,” you mean if I we re you, if I had your position or your situation.  “If I were in your shoes, I  wouldn’t hem and haw.”  “To hem (hem) and haw (haw)” is a single verb; in this sente nce the two words are used together typically to mean to hesitate, to spend a lot of time deciding whether you want to you or not, to spend a lot of time  going, “Oh, maybe I should retire...well, maybe not.  I’m not sure.”  Someone w ho is not very decisive, who doesn’t make decisions quickly or easily could be said hemming  and hawing.

 Oscar says, “I’d make the decision to retire now – today!”  Meredith says, “Why are you getting all worked up?”  “To get worked up” is a phrasal verb meaning to become worried, to become anxious, to not be able to st op thinking about something, perhaps to become angry or upset.  Someone ma y say to you, “Don’t get all worked up about it,” meaning don’t get so anxi ous, so worried, so excited about this particular issue.

Meredith says, “Are you after my job?”  In this case, “afte r” means in pursuit of, wanting to get or to have something, trying to do somet hing.  Here in Los Angeles it’s very common to see older men – 50-60 years old  – marrying younger women, often 20 or 30 years old.  Some people say the woman is after his money.  Of course, it’s possible for a younger man to m arry an older woman and to be after her money; could be either way.  I’m not after anyone’s money.  I don’t think anyone is after my money, although my wife di d ask me about going skydiving, where you jump out of a plane down to the gro und.  Hmm, maybe I should be careful!

Oscar says, “No way (I’m not after your job)!”  By the way,  “after” has other meanings in English as well, and you know where to find those, in the Learning Guide.  Oscar says, “No way (not at all; I’m not after you r job)!  I just can’t stand to see someone who can retire stay at this job.  I’d tra de places with you in a minute.”  “To trade places with (someone)” means to excha nge your situation for another situation.  So you’re working in job A, I’m wo rking in job B; if we trade places, now I’m working in your job and you’re working in  my job.

Oscar says that he would trade places with Meredith “in a  minute,” meaning without even thinking about it, quickly.  Meredith says, “I  doubt that – not if it meant being a card-carrying member of AARP.”  “To be a card-carrying member” means to be an official member of an organization, usu ally an organization that you believe in very strongly.  Organizations typically issue sm all pieces of paper, called “cards,” that say that you are a member, that’s whe re this expression comes from.  AARP (sometimes pronounced like a word, “AA RP”) is the American Association of Retired Persons.  It’s an organiza tion for people over the age of 50, which tries to influence regulations a nd laws related to older people.  It’s a very powerful organization in the Unite d States, as our population gets older and older.  You may not have noticed, but e veryone seems to be getting older every year; I’m not sure what’s going on!

Oscar says, “I didn’t say I was ready for retirement.  I’m just thinking about it – all the time!” meaning always.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Meredith:  Are you going to Stanley’s retirement party?

Oscar:  Sure, I want a glimpse of the future.  I can’t wait to retire.

Meredith:  It’ll be a long time before you get the g olden handshake.  Me?  I may be ready for early retirement.

Oscar:  Are you seriously thinking about taking the early re tirement package the company is offering?

Meredith:  I’m thinking about it.  My health isn’t get ting any better, and I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in this office.

Oscar:  But can you afford it?

Meredith:  The early retirement package is pretty genero us, and I’ve saved up a nice little nest egg over the years.

Oscar:  Then what are you waiting for?  If I were in yo ur shoes, I wouldn’t hem and haw about it.  I’d make the decision to retire now  – today!

Meredith:  Why are you getting all worked up?  Are you after my job?

Oscar:  No way!  I just can’t stand to see someone who can retire stay at this job. I’d trade places with you in a minute.

Meredith:  I doubt that – not if it meant being a ca rd-carrying member of AARP. You’re too young to be thinking about retirement.

Oscar:  I didn’t say I was ready for retirement.  I’m j ust thinking about it – all the time!

[end of dialogue]

We hope that our scriptwriter doesn’t take early retirem ent or accept any golden handshakes. That’s because we love Dr. Lucy Tse.





# Reading a World Map

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 81: Reading a World Map.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 581.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

All that can be found on our website, eslpod.com.

This episode is called “Reading a World Map.”  We’re go ing to talk about vocabulary related to maps.  This is a dialogue between G reg and Julianna. Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Greg:  What are you doing with that map and that gl obe?

Julianna:  I’m trying to keep track of Carmen as she travel s from country to country.  I just got another postcard from her today.

Greg:  I’m not sure I like the idea of my daughter tra veling around the world with a group of people for three months.  It’s not safe.

Julianna:  She can take care of herself.  You know she’ s the adventurous type. Give her a compass and she can find her way around anywh ere.  Help me find Nauru on this map.  I don’t even know what continent it’s on.  I was never any good at geography.

Greg:  All right.  You look above the equator and I’l l look below it, but couldn’t you just look it up on the Internet?  It would be easy to find the latitude and longitude of this place.

Julianna:  This is more fun.  I sort of feel like I’m on  an adventure myself.

 Greg:  I can’t make heads or tails of this map.  It’s n ot to scale and this legend is all wrong!

Julianna:  It doesn’t matter.  We just need to find the place name, and then I can put a pin in this map showing where’s she’s been.

Greg:  I have a better idea.  I’ll look it up on the Internet and get you all of the vital statistics you’d want, like its location, okay?

Julianna:  Forget it.  Sometimes it’s more fun doing t hings the hard way.

[end of dialogue]

Greg begins by asking Julianna (or Julianna, I think she pr efers Julianna), “What are you doing with that map and that globe?”  A “map ” is a piece of paper with drawings on it that shows the location of places.  “Map”  actually has a couple of different meanings in English however.  To find those t ake a look at our Learning Guide for this episode.  A “globe” (globe) is a round ball that has a special stand, and it goes around, and on this ball is a map of the world so you can see where all of the countries are in the entire world.

Greg says, “What are you doing with that map and globe. ”  Julianna says, “I’m trying to keep track of Carmen as she travels from country to  country.  I just got another postcard from her today.”  A “postcard” (one wor d) is a small rectangular, typically, piece of paper that you send through the mail .  It usually has a picture of the place you are visiting, and on the back you write a message, something like “Wish you were here,” meaning I wish that you could be with me.  Usually not though, usually you – you don’t want other people with you on vacation.  But you say that, right?

Julianna says, “I just got another postcard from Carmen to day.”  Greg says, “I’m not sure I like the idea of my daughter traveling aroun d the world with a group of people for three months.  It’s not safe.”  So, Greg an d Julianna have a daughter who is going around the world with a group of people .  Julianna says, “She can take care of herself.  You know she’s the adventurous type .”  Someone who is “adventurous” is someone who is always looking for excitemen t, wanting to do new and unusual things.  I am not the adventurous type.  I prefer to sit in my chair, drink some tea, and read my book.  I’m kind of a b oring person basically!

Julianna says, “Give her (meaning give Carmen) a compass and  she can find her way around anywhere.”  A “compass” (compass) is a small, fla t, round device

 that has an arrow in it, and the arrow always points no rth no matter which way you hold it.  It’s something that a traveler would use t o know what direction they should go in, especially if you are, for example, out in the woods, or away from anything that would give you a good indication of which  direction was north, at nighttime for example.

She says that Carmen can find her way around anywhere w ith a compass.  She then says to Greg, “Help me find Nauru on this map.  I don’t even know what continent it’s on.”  Nauru, of course, is a country.  A “co ntinent” is one of the seven large areas of land in the world.  We talk about seven continents in the U.S.: we talk about Africa, Asia, Antarctica, Australia,  Europe, North America, and South America.  In some places they talk about five co ntinents, but in the United States we have seven, or at least that’s what we sa y.  Julianna is trying to find what continent the country of Nauru is on.  She says,  “I was never any good at geography.”  “Geography” is the study of the surface or  the area of somewhere on Earth, especially where things like countries and citie s are located; that’s part of geography.

Greg says, “All right (okay).  You look above the equator and I’ll look below it.” The “equator” is an imaginary line around the middle of our planet, Earth.  It separates the north half from the south half.  We call  these halves “hemispheres.”  So there’s the northern hemisphere, wh ere I live, and the southern hemisphere, where perhaps you live.  That’s what  the equator is.  So, Greg is going to look in the northern hemisphere, and  Julianna will look in the southern one.  He says, “couldn’t you just look it up on the Internet?”  Greg says, “It would be easy to find the latitude and longitude of this place.”  “Latitude” refers to imaginary lines that go around the earth from east to west, you might say. “Longitude” are lines that are “perpendicular,” they’r e at a right angle to latitude lines.  Longitude lines go, if you will, from north to  south.  If you know the latitude – if you know how far north or south something is, and longitude, how far east or west something is, then you can find a place.  Every place o n Earth has a specific latitude and longitude.  Latitudes are sometime s called “parallels,” so we talk about the 45th parallel.  These latitude lines are sometimes used, for example, in dividing countries or areas.

Julianna says, “This is more fun.  I sort of feel like I’m on an adventure myself.”  “I sort of” means I somewhat, I kind of, to a certain exten t: “I sort of don’t want to go and see my brother-in-law.”  I sort of don’t want to g o, I kind of, it’s not something that I – I love to do.  I’m not completely against the  idea, but I sort of don’t want to go.  Well, Julianna says she sort of feels like she’s on an  adventure.

 Greg says, “I can’t make heads or tails of this map.”  The expression “to make heads or tails (tails) of (something)” means to be abl e to understand something. The word “heads and tails” comes from a coin; there are  two sides.  A front of a coin we call the head, and the back of the coin called the tail.  So the expression “to make heads or tails of” means to be able to unders tand.  We use it in talking about anything that seems very confusing to us.  Greg says, “ It’s not to scale and this legend is all wrong!”  Greg is saying that the map is not to scale.  “To scale” means that the actual distance on the map between two p oints – between, say, one city and another city – the distance on the map is the  same in proportion to the actual distance.  That is, if you look at a map on the United States that is to scale, you’ll see that 500 miles from Los Angeles to the n orth is perhaps two inches.  Well, two inches on anywhere in the map equals 5 00 miles.  That’s a map that is drawn to scale.  A “legend,” sometimes called  a “key” (key), is a small box on a map that explains what the different colors or  symbols mean on that particular map.  They often also tell you what the scale  is: one inch equals one mile, or one inch equals 200 miles.

Julianna says, “It doesn’t matter (it’s not important if it’s not to scale and the legend is all wrong).  We just need to find the place name.”  The “place name” is the word on a map that indicates the country or city or other place where this thing is.  “Then,” she says, “I can put a pin on this ma p showing where’s she’s been.”  A “pin” is a small piece of metal, like a small  little stick, but you use it to attach, say, a piece of paper to the wall.

Greg says, “I have a better idea.  I’ll look it up on t he Internet and give you all the vital statistics you’d want, like its location, okay?”  “Vital  (vital) statistics” in this case means detailed information, numerical information .  Technically, it usually refers to how many people are born, how many people di e, coming from the Latin (vita) “vita,” or “vita,” referring to life.  But here , it just means the specific details. Julianna doesn’t want to look it up on the Internet h owever.  She says, “Forget it. Sometimes it’s more fun doing things the hard way,” doi ng things in the most difficult way possible.

Where’s Nauru?  Well, I looked it up on the Internet;  I didn’t look on a map or a globe.  It’s actually a small island nation in the Sout h Pacific.  Maybe I’ll go there one day and visit!

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

 Greg:  What are you doing with that map and that gl obe?

Julianna:  I’m trying to keep track of Carmen as she travel s from country to country.  I just got another postcard from her today.

Greg:  I’m not sure I like the idea of my daughter tra veling around the world with a group of people for three months.  It’s not safe.

Julianna:  She can take care of herself.  You know she’ s the adventurous type. Give her a compass and she can find her way around anywh ere.  Help me find Nauru on this map.  I don’t even know what continent it’s on.  I was never any good at geography.

# A Parent-Teacher Conference

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 82: A Parent- Teacher Conference.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 582.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at eslpod.com.  Download a Learning Guide for this episode that contains more information to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “A Parent-Teacher Conference.”  It ’s a dialogue between Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Polo.  One is a teacher, one is a pa rent; they’re talking about the parent’s son and are going to be using a lot  of vocabulary that you would hear if a parent were talking to a teacher abou t how his or her daughter or son was doing in school.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Ms. Vasquez:  Hello, Mr. Polo.  I’m Ms. Vasquez.  Please h ave a seat.

Mr. Polo:  Thank you.

Ms. Vasquez:  In this parent-teacher conference, I want to  go beyond Marco’s report cards and his standardized test scores to talk about  his general performance in the classroom.

Mr. Polo:  That’s great.  I want to know how he’s doin g.

Ms. Vasquez:  Marco is a good student.  He’s attentive in cl ass, a hard worker, and hands in his homework on time.  Here’s his portfoli o, if you want to take a look at his classroom work.

Mr. Polo:  This is great.  Are there any areas he needs to work on?

Ms. Vasquez:  Marco is a good student, but he does sometime s misbehave.  He often has disagreements with other students and loses his t emper.  I think he needs to work on his social skills.

 Mr. Polo:  Well, I don’t think that’s the most importa nt thing, do you?  His academics are the most important and he seems to be doing  well in his subjects.

Ms. Vasquez:  It’s true that academics are important, but  learning to work cooperatively with other people is important, too, if he wants to get ahead in life, don’t you think?

Mr. Polo:  I’ll have a talk with him.  I’m sure you’ll  see an improvement.

Ms. Vasquez:  I appreciate you taking this seriously.  Again,  Marco is a good student and it’s a pleasure to have him in my class.

Mr. Polo:  I’m glad to hear that.  Good-bye.

Ms. Vasquez:  Have a good afternoon.

[end of dialogue]

Ms. Vasquez begins our dialogue; she’s the teacher.  She s ays, “Hello, Mr. Polo. I’m Ms. Vasquez.  Please have a seat.”  Typically, teacher s would probably call parents “Mr.” or “Mrs. (Something),” not their first n ame unless they knew each other already.  Similarly, the parent would probably ca ll the teacher “Mr. (Something)” or “Mrs. (Something)” or “Ms. (Something ).”  Mr. Polo says, “Thank you.”  Ms. Vasquez asks him to “have a seat,” to sit down.  She says, “In this parent-teacher conference, I want to go beyond Marco’s r eport cards and his standardized test scores and talk about his general perfo rmance in the classroom.”  A “parent-teacher conference” usually is somet hing that schools will do (I’m talking about kindergarten through 12th grade  – through high school) about two or three times a year; some schools do it four  times a year.  This is one night when the teachers come to school, and the pare nts go and can talk to their student’s teacher.  The idea is that the parent can get a better idea about how their son or daughter is doing by talking directly to  the teacher.  When I was teaching high school and junior high school we would ha ve these parent-teacher conferences.  I absolutely hated them because, of course, all the parents think that their sons and daughters are perfect, and that i f they’re not learning something it’s because you aren’t doing a good job teachi ng rather than the kid playing video games five hours every night.  But, we’ll ge t back to the dialogue.

Ms. Vasquez says, “I want to go beyond Marco’s report cards and his standardized test scores.”  “To go beyond (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning to discuss or deal with something in addition to  what is expected, to go

 further into something than expected.  Normally, a teach er talks about a student’s report cards for example.  A “report card” is a piece of  paper – in the old days – where you show how the student is doing every “term,” eve ry part of the school year.  Sometimes two times a year, usually four times a ye ar, you give these report cards to the student.  The student takes them ho me and shows the parents, that will tell the parent how the student is doing in the different classes that the son or daughter is taking.  Hopefully, the chi ld doesn’t change the report card somewhere between school and home!  Nowadays, I suppo se, it’s all done through the Internet or Twitter – I…I don’t know.  “S tandardized test scores” are the scores – the marks, if you will – that a student recei ves on a test, a national test typically, that all students at his or her grade level  take.  So these are tests that usually private companies develop, and they give them  to thousands or tens of thousands students – perhaps millions of students – and it allows you to compare how much this student knows compared to the average  student. Standardized test scores; these are very important especially now in American education.

Well, Ms. Vasquez wants to go beyond the report cards and the standardized test scores to talk about Marco’s general performance in the classroom.  Mr. Polo says, “That’s great.  I want to know how he’s doing.”  Oh , really?  Ms. Vasquez says, “Marco is a good student.”  Probably lying!  She says, “ He’s attentive in class, a hard worker, and hands in his homework on time.”   “To be attentive” means that you listen to what someone is saying, you pay at tention to them.  A “hard worker” is someone who tries very hard to do what is expected or required of them.  “To hand in” is a two-word phrasal verb mea ning to give usually a piece of paper or a document or a form to someone in author ity, often for it to be evaluated.  So we talk about how students turn in the ir homework.  They give the piece of paper to their teacher.  The teacher then loo ks at it, grades it (sees if it is correct or not), and then gives it back to the student.  So, Ms. Vasquez is saying that Marco is attentive in class, a hard worker, and hand s in his “homework,” the assignments he does outside of school – at home, or the li brary, or wherever. “Homework” is one word.

Ms. Vasquez says, “Here’s his portfolio, if you want to look at his classroom work.”  Portfolios have been become popular in American schools in the last 20 years.  What happens is the student hands in different assi gnments – different things that he or she is required to do, and the teache r keeps all of these together in one place to be able to show them to the parent to be able to evaluate the student at the end of the term – the end of the semester, the three or four months of school.  That’s a portfolio.  “Portfolio” has other meanings in English that are not found in this Learning Guide.

 Mr. Polo, looking at this portfolio, says, “This is great.   Are there any areas he needs to work on?”  “To work on” is a two-word phrasal v erb meaning to try to improve something, to become better at something.  “To work” has a number of different phrasal verbs connected to it; take a look at the Learning Guide, where you will find those meanings.

Ms. Vasquez says, “Marco is a good student, but he does someti mes misbehave.”  “To misbehave” means to act inappropriately, to not do what you are told or expected to do.  It’s a word we use especiall y with children, whether they’re at home or at school.  So Ms. Vasquez now is start ing to tell the truth. She says Marco “often has disagreements with other studen ts and loses his temper.”  “To lose your temper” (temper) means become ve ry, very angry with someone; maybe you start hitting them or fighting with them even.  But, Ms. Vasquez doesn’t want to say that, she puts it very politely – very nicely, says that he loses his temper.  “I think he needs to work on his soci al skills.”  “Social skills” refers to the ability to be able to have conversations wi th other people, to be positive, to make friends; those would be good social skills to have.

Mr. Polo says, “Well, I don’t think that’s the most impor tant thing, do you?”  It’s not the most important thing for his son.  Of course, Mr. Polo doesn’t have to be the teacher and have this misbehaving student in his classroo m.  Mr. Polo says that Marco’s academics are the most important – the most i mportant thing – and he seems to be doing well in his subjects.  “Academics” ref ers to traditional areas in school – traditional classes: reading, writing, math, history, science, podcasting.  Mr. Polo says that Marco seems to be doing well in his “subjects,” in the classes that he is taking.  “Subject” has a couple of di fferent meanings however, and those are in the Learning Guide.

Ms. Vasquez says, “It’s true that academics are important, bu t learning to work cooperatively with other people is important, too, if he wants to get ahead in life, don’t you think?”  “Cooperatively” means that you are abl e to do things with other people without getting angry.  You’re able to do the m in such a way as that it is a positive experience and result.  American schools, again i n the last 25-30 years, have used cooperative learning groups to get children –  students – to learn how to work together; it’s a very popular approach.  Ms. Vasq uez says that Marco needs to work cooperatively with other people if he want s to get ahead in life. The phrasal verb  “to get ahead” means to be successful, esp ecially more successful than other people.

 Mr. Polo says, “I’ll have a talk with him (meaning I wil l talk to him about this in a serious way).  I’m sure you’ll see an improvement.”  An “i mprovement” is things getting better.  Ms. Vasquez says, “I appreciate you taking this seriously.  Again, Marco is a good student and it’s a pleasure to have him in class.”  “It’s a pleasure” means it’s nice to have him in class.  She’s lying,  of course!  Mr. Polo says, “I’m glad to hear that.  Good-bye.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Ms. Vasquez:  Hello, Mr. Polo.  I’m Ms. Vasquez.  Please h ave a seat.

Mr. Polo:  Thank you.

Ms. Vasquez:  In this parent-teacher conference, I want to  go beyond Marco’s report cards and his standardized test scores to talk about  his general performance in the classroom.

Jan begins by saying to Tim, “This is the life!”  That ex pression, “this is the life,” is used to show when you are very happy; you’re enjoying yourse lf very much, especially doing whatever it is you are doing right now.  Jan says, “Spending the day at a spa is my idea of paradise.”  A “spa” (spa) is a b usiness where people go to usually receive some sort of treatment or service tha t makes them healthier, makes them relax, makes them more beautiful.  That would be a spa.  I definitely need a spa!  Well, this spa is Jan’s idea of pa radise.  “Paradise” is a place that is very enjoyable, a very pleasant place; we m ight say “heaven.”  This place is my idea of heaven – my idea of paradise.

Tim says, “Yeah, it’s great.”  Jan says, “Aren’t you enjoyin g yourself?”  She thinks maybe Tim really doesn’t like the spa that much.  Tim says,  “The massage was okay, but why do I have to get a facial and a body wrap?  I’m a guy!”  A “massage” (massage) is when someone touches you with their  hands, usually, to try to relax your muscles, to relax your body; to relieve te nsion, we might say. Tim says, “The massage was okay,” but he wants to know why he needs to get a facial and a body wrap.  A “facial” (facial) is a special treatment for your face, you can guess, that cleans it.  It is usually something that invo lves using different creams, or things that they put on your face.  I don’t kno w; I’ve never had one!  A “body wrap” is where your whole body is covered in some sort  of liquid, cream, lotion, or something else; it’s supposed to make the skin  of your body softer. Facials and body wraps are things that traditionally a wo man would get at a spa, not a man.  I should also mention that “wrap” (wrap),  as in body wrap, has other meanings in English that can be found in the Learning  Guide.

So Tim says, “I’m a guy,” meaning I’m a man – I’m a mal e, I should not have to get these things.  Jan says, “Men need rejuvenating, too. ”  “To rejuvenate” means to make younger, to make you feel better, make you feel new.  Some people work all day, they come home, they have a glass of wine, and they feel rejuvenated; they feel like they now have more energy.  Jan says, “These are all holistic treatments and you’ll feel like a new man when you’re done.”  “Holistic” means here relating to your entire body; relating to a ll of your health, not just one

 particular part.  The word “holistic” is used in many dif ferent ways, but usually it refers to the whole – the (whole) of something, alth ough it’s spelled (holistic), no “w”.

Jan says that these holistic treatments will make Tim feel like a new man.  She says, “Just enjoy the pampering.”  “Pampering” comes from t he verb “to pamper” (pamper).  “To pamper (someone)” is to do some things f or them to make them feel good, to relax them, to make them feel comfortab le.  Often these are things that we might consider luxurious, expensive, something tha t makes you feel good.

Tim says, “I feel like an idiot.  How am I supposed to r elax?”  Jan says, “Why don’t you get a body scrub or a scalp massage instead?”  A “ body scrub” (scrub) is when they put certain things on your body, perhaps som ething that is rough – something that is what we would call “abrasive.”  They rub it on your body in order to remove the dead skin cells so that your skin seems br ighter and younger.  A “scalp massage” refers to your “scalp” (scalp), w hich is the skin on top of your head, underneath your hair – if you have ha ir!  So, a scalp massage would be someone massaging the top of your head basicall y.  Jan says, “Maybe that’ll calm your nerves.”  “To calm your nerves” means to make you feel more relaxed and comfortable.  The person who comes home and has a glass of wine or a cup of tea may do so to calm their nerves, to make them less tense, make them more relaxed.  The word “calm” has a couple of dif ferent meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations.

Tim says, “I don’t need a body scrub or another massage.  I just want to get out of here.  When will we be done?”  When will we be f inished here?  Jan says, “After this, all we have left (meaning the only thing that remains for us to do) are manicures and pedicures.”  A “manicure” (manicure) is whe n you go somewhere and they make your fingernails look good.  They cut them; they perhaps paint them if you’re a woman, typically.  It’s supposed to mak e your fingernails look better.  A “pedicure” (pedicure) is the same thing but for your toenails, the nails on your feet.  When I’m talking about “nails,” I’m tal king about something that is at the end of each finger or toe, on the top of them , that protects the very top of the finger.  Again, manicures and pedicures are typically things that a woman would get, not a man.

Tim says, “What?!  I’m not getting a manicure or a ped icure.”  Jan says, “You did promise to go with me to the spa if I agreed to have yo ur four college friends stay in our house for two weeks, remember?”  You see, the re ason Tim is there is it’s something he is doing for his wife.  What his wife is do ing for him is allowing him

 to invite his friends from college – from his college yea rs, many years ago – to stay in their house.  Tim says, “Yes, I remember.  All ri ght, let’s get this over with.”  “Let’s get this over with” means let’s complete t his, let’s finish this as soon as possible; usually you say it about something that is pai nful or not pleasant.

Jan says, “Just be glad I didn’t sign you up for waxing!”  “Waxing” (waxing) is another beauty treatment where hair is removed from a particular part of your body by taking hot wax – “wax” is what you make a candle ou t of – you take hot wax and you put it on the skin, and then you allow it to  cool a little so that it isn’t as hot, and then you pull it off, and with it will com e your hair in that part of your body.  It can, needless to say, be somewhat painful, especi ally for a man who has a lot of hair.  So Jan is saying just be glad I didn’ t sign you up for – meaning making appointment for you – for waxing, something that  would, again, normally be done to a woman.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Jan:  This is the life!  Spending the day at a spa is my i dea of paradise.

Tim:  Yeah, it’s great.

Jan:  Aren’t you enjoying yourself?

Tim:  The massage was okay, but why do I have to get a faci al and a body wrap? I’m a guy!

Jan:  Men need rejuvenating, too.  These are all holist ic treatments and you’ll feel like a new man when you’re done.  Just enjoy the pamper ing.

Tim:  I feel like an idiot.  How am I supposed to rela x?

Jan:  Why don’t you get a body scrub or a scalp massage inste ad?  Maybe that’ll calm your nerves.

Tim:  I don’t need a body scrub or another massage.  I j ust want to get out of here.  When will we be done?

Jan:  After this, all we have left are manicures and pe dicures.

 Tim:  What?!  I’m not getting a manicure or a pedicur e.

Jan:  You did promise to go with me to the spa if I a greed to have your four college friends stay in our house for two weeks, remember ?

Tim:  Yes, I remember.  All right, let’s get this over with.

Jan:  Just be glad I didn’t sign you up for waxing!

Your English, we hope, was rejuvenated today by the wond erful script by Dr. Lucy Tse.  Thank you, Lucy.





# Calling in Sick to Work

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 84: Calling in Sick to Work.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 584.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Go to our website at eslpod.com to download a Learning  Guide for this episode, it will help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is called “Calling in Sick to Work.”  It’s a dialogue between Peter and Magda about what happens when someone decides they are too sick to go to work.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

I was fed up with work and wanted the day off.  I decid ed to call in sick.  I wasn’t prepared, though, to be peppered with questions.

Peter:  Hello, this is Peter.  Is this Magda?

Magda:  Yes.  This is Magda.

Peter:  Hi, Magda.  I won’t be coming in today.  I’m  not feeling well.  I think I’ve come down with something.

Magda:  Hmm, what seems to be the problem?

Peter:  The problem?  Oh…I’ve been up all night throw ing up and I feel terrible.

Magda:  Didn’t you have something like this two weeks ago when you called in sick?

Peter:  Two weeks ago?  No, I had food poisoning two w eeks ago.

Magda:  And what about a month ago when you called i n sick?

Peter:  That was a 24-hour bug.

 Magda:  Didn’t you just take a day off from work because of a death in the family?

Peter:  Yes, I had to go to the funeral.

Magda:  I see.  That’s one day off from work a week, fo ur weeks in a row.  [long silence]

Peter:  Uh, I’ll be in within the hour.

Magda:  I’m glad you’ve had a miraculous recovery.

[end of dialogue]

Peter begins our dialogue by saying that he was fed (fed ) up with work and wanted the day off.  “To be fed up” means to be very fr ustrated with something, to be very tired of doing something.  “I am fed up wi th this TV show, I don’t want to watch it anymore.”  I’m tired of it; I don’t want  to see it again.  It’s used to express extreme frustration – very frustrated.  Well, Peter  wants to have the day off, meaning he doesn’t want to work today – who does?  So, he says he decides to call in sick.  “To call in sick” means to call your boss – your supervisor – and let him or her know that you are ill, you’re sick.  Oh , you can’t go into work because you don’t feel well.  It always helps to sound very sick when you call in sick.  Peter says, “I wasn’t prepared, though, to be peppe red with questions.” “To be peppered (peppered) with questions” means to b e asked many, many questions, usually in a very short period of time – one q uestion, then another question, then another question.

Peter calls up and he says, “Hello, this is Peter.  Is thi s Magda?” and Magda says, “Yes.  This is Magda.”  Peter says, “Hi, Magda.  I won ’t be coming in today.”  “To come in” means to go to a particular pla ce where they are expecting you, usually work.  “Is John coming in today?” meaning is h e going to be here to work – is he coming to the office?  Peter says he won’t b e coming in today, “I’m not feeling well,” he says.  When someone says they “don’ t feel well” they mean they’re sick.  Perhaps they have a cold; perhaps they have a f lu or some other illness.  He says, “I think I’ve come down with something.”   “To come down with something” is a phrasal verb that usually means to catch a co ld.  You start sneezing, your head hurts; maybe you are running a tempe rature, meaning that the heat of your body is too high.  It can generally mea n, however, to become sick, but usually sick with either a cold or a flu, not too serious.  There’s actually a

 couple meaning of this verb, “to come.”  Take a look at o ur Learning Guide for some additional explanations.

So, Peter is coming down with something; it’s a nice th ing to say if you don’t want to be too specific about what your illness is.  Magda says , “Hmm, what seems to be the problem?”  What is wrong with you specifically?  Peter says, “The problem?”  Of course, he’s not prepared to answer medi cal questions from his boss.  He says, “Oh…I’ve been up all night throwing up and  I feel terrible.”  “To be up all night” means to be awake all night.  What has he been awake doing? He’s been awake throwing up.  “To throw up” is a two-w ord phrasal verb meaning to vomit (vomit), where the contents of your stomach come  out and go out your mouth.  I think you understand what I’m saying – not a very pleasant thing!

Peter says he feels terrible; he feels very, very sick.  Magda  says, “Didn’t you have something like this two weeks ago when you called in si ck?”  She’s reminding Peter that he was sick only two weeks ago with a  similar illness. Obviously, she doesn’t believe Peter.  Peter says, “Two we eks ago?  No, I had food poisoning two weeks ago.”  So, Peter is saying that he had a different illness two weeks ago; he had food poisoning.  “Food poisoning”  is when you eat some food that is bad that makes you sick; that’s food poisoning.

Magda says, “And what about a month ago when you called  in sick?”  Four weeks ago Peter was also sick.  Peter says, “That was a 24-hou r bug” (bug).  A “24-hour bug” is an illness that is not very serious that u sually only lasts for a day or so.  Again, we’re typically referring to a cold or a  flu; flu is probably more likely. A flu bug usually means that your stomach is upset, you have a headache, and so forth.

Magda says, “Didn’t you just take a day off from work be cause of a death in the family?”  Magda’s asking Peter if he took a day off from work – meaning a day he did not go into work, usually because you are sick or you ha ve some other important appointment – because of a death in the fa mily.  “A death in the family,” as you probably can guess, means when someone close t o you in your family dies: your uncle, your aunt, your grandmother.  T here’s sort of a weird joke in schools if you’re a teacher or a student, the student who doesn’t want to go to school will say that they went to their grandmother’s fun eral, and sometimes they use this excuse more than twice.  So it’s sometimes not the best one to use, especially if your grandmothers have already died two or t hree times!

Peter says, “Yes, I had to go to the funeral.”  “The fu neral” (funeral) is a ceremony – an event that happens when someone dies befor e their body is put

 into the ground.  Peter is saying that he had to go t o this funeral.  Magda says, “I see (I understand).  That’s one day off from work a week,  four times in a row.” “In a row” (row) means one after the other, consecutivel y, without any breaks or gaps.  If the Boston Red Sox win the World Series in ba seball – the big championship – this year, next year, and the year after t hat, we would say they won three years in a row.  I hope they don’t, but in ca se they do, that’s what we would say.  “Row” has a couple of different meanings in English however; you know where to find those, in our Learning Guide.

Well, Magda obviously isn’t very happy with Peter.  He kn ows that she doesn’t believe him, so Peter says, “Uh, I will be in within t he hour,” meaning in less than an hour.  Magda jokes with him somewhat, and says, “I’m g lad you’ve had a miraculous recovery.”  “Recovery” is when you get better fro m something; “miraculous” is something that is a miracle, something tha t is impossible physically.  Of course, Magda is joking here about the mira culous recovery that Peter had.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

I was fed up with work and wanted the day off.  I decid ed to call in sick.  I wasn’t prepared, though, to be peppered with questions.

Peter:  Hello, this is Peter.  Is this Magda?

Magda:  Yes.  This is Magda.

Peter:  Hi, Magda.  I won’t be coming in today.  I’m  not feeling well.  I think I’ve come down with something.

Magda:  Hmm, what seems to be the problem?

Peter:  The problem?  Oh…I’ve been up all night throw ing up and I feel terrible.

Magda:  Didn’t you have something like this two weeks ago when you called in sick?

Peter:  Two weeks ago?  No, I had food poisoning two w eeks ago.

Magda:  And what about a month ago when you called i n sick?

 Peter:  That was a 24-hour bug.

Magda:  Didn’t you just take a day off from work because of a death in the family?

Peter:  Yes, I had to go to the funeral.

Magda:  I see.  That’s one day off from work a week, fo ur weeks in a row.  [long silence]

Peter:  Uh, I’ll be in within the hour.

Magda:  I’m glad you’ve had a miraculous recovery.

[end of dialogue]

Good thing our scriptwriter didn’t call in sick today!  That would be the wonderful Dr. Lucy Tse.  Thank you, Lucy.





# Being Clear or Confusing

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 85: Being Clear or Confusing.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast number 585.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide.  The Learning Guide will help you improve your English even f aster than just listening to this podcast.  It will also make you healthy, wealthy, and wise!

This episode is called “Being Clear or Confusing.”  It’s a dialogue between Bethany and Laurent about explaining things, especially to someone else, that may be difficult for them to understand.  Let’s get sta rted.

[start of dialogue]

Laurent:  So I’m confused.  Who’s David again?

Bethany:  David is my roommate’s friend’s brother.  Haven ’t you been listening?

Laurent:  I have, but how am I supposed to keep all of these people straight? Your stories are always so convoluted, with too many twists and turns.  Why don’t you try telling a straightforward story for once?

Bethany:  My stories are only confusing for people who do n’t pay attention or who can’t deal with complexity.

Laurent:  Complexity?  Is that what you call going off  on tangents and including completely irrelevant information?  Half the time the end of the story contradicts the beginning!

Bethany:  You just don’t appreciate intricate plots.  My stories are crystal clear to anyone who pays attention.  Good stories have lots of det ail.  Just ask Shakespeare.

Laurent:  Talk about delusions of grandeur!  When you st art comparing yourself to Shakespeare, it’s time for you to seek professional he lp!

 [end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Laurent saying, “So I’m confu sed.”  “To be confused” means not to understand what is happening or what is be ing discussed.  We might also say to feel puzzled.  Laurent says, “Who’s David again?”  Obviously, we’ve come in in the middle of a story in this dialogue,  and Laurent is trying to get Bethany to explain it better to him.

Bethany says, “David is my roommate’s friend’s brother.”  No tice in English that you can have a possessive of in front of a possessive in fron t of a possessive. Here, we have “my roommate’s friend’s brother.”  This is the brother of my roommate’s friend.  Bethany says, “Haven’t you been listeni ng?”  Laurent says, “I have, but how am I supposed to keep all of these peopl e straight?”  “To keep (something) straight” (straight) means to be able to u nderstand something by keeping it well organized in your mind.  If you’re read ing a very complicated novel with lots of different people in it – lots of differe nt characters, like one of the Russian novels from the 19th and 20th centuries, they’re very difficult perhaps to understand – to keep everyone straight, to understand who  is who.

Laurent says that he cannot keep all of these people in B ethany’s story straight. “Your stories are always so convoluted,” he says, “with too many twists and turns.”  “To be convoluted” (convoluted) means to be very co mplicated, very difficult to understand or to follow.  “Twists (twists) a nd turns” is an expression that means there are many unexpected changes, making the st ory difficult to understand.  Sometimes you will go to see a movie and th ere’ll be many different twists and turns, there’ll be many different changes in t he story that make it difficult to understand.  Laurent says, “Why don’t you tr y telling a straightforward story for once?”  “Straightforward” (one word) means un complicated, not difficult to understand, simple, direct.  “For once” is an expression  we use to mean that it doesn’t happen very often, that something is very rare; yo u want it to happen more often.  In this case, Laurent wants Bethany to tell  a simple, easy to understand story more often.  That’s why he says, “Why don’ t you try telling a straightforward story for once?”  The “for once” impli es Bethany doesn’t do it very often, but that she should.  For example, it would be  nice if my neighbor stopped yelling into his cell phone outside of my window for once , implying that he does it all the time – and he does!

Bethany says, “My stories are only confusing for people who d on’t pay attention, who can’t deal with complexity.”  “To pay attention” mea ns to listen, to try to understand, to follow something.  “Complexity” means ver y complicated, very convoluted, very difficult to understand because there are  many different parts of

 the story.  Bethany says that her stories are only confusing to people who can’t “deal with” complexity; that is, they can’t handle – they don’t know how to behave or think in a certain situation.

Laurent says, “Complexity?  Is that what you call going of f on tangents and including completely irrelevant information?”  “To go o ff on a tangent” (tangent) means to begin talking or writing about something that  is not directly related to the topic.  I do this all the time here on ESL Podcast and English Café.  I go off on a tangent; I start talking about something that isn ’t directly related to this episode.  Some people really hate that; they don’t li ke it, they can’t follow the story.  Laurent says that Bethany is including in her story co mpletely irrelevant information.  “Irrelevant” means not related to what  is being discussed, not connected to your main topic.  Laurent says, “Half the tim e (meaning most of the time, or at least 50 percent of the time) the end of the story contradicts the beginning!”  “To contradict” means to disagree with wha t has been already said, to say something opposite of what is said.  You should nev er contradict your wife, for example.

Bethany says, “You just don’t appreciate intricate plots.”   Something that is “intricate” (intricate) is something that is very detailed , we might say very involved; there are many different parts that work toge ther.  You can have something physical that is intricate: a watch, for example , or a piece of jewelry. In this case, Bethany is talking about the plots of her st ories.  A “plot” is what happens first, then what happens next, and so forth – t he actual events of the story.  She says her plots are intricate.  “My stories,” she sa ys, “are crystal clear to anyone who pays attention.”  The expression “crystal clea r” means very direct, very easy to understand.  Very clear – no confusion.  She says,  “Good stories have a lot of detail.”  A “detail” is a single, small p iece of information about something, a single fact.  “Detail,” however, has other meanings in English, and those can be found in the Learning Guide.  Bethany says, “Just ask Shakespeare.”  Shakespeare, of course, was the great playw right who wrote very complicated, interesting plays.  “Just ask” is an expression w e use when we are trying to compare ourselves perhaps to someone else, or to make reference to someone else.  You’re using that someone else as an exampl e of something. For example: “The study of geometry is easy, just ask Euclid.”

Laurent says, “Talk about delusions of grandeur.”  “Delusi ons” are things that you imagine that are not true.  “Grandeur” is something ve ry powerful, something very important.  “To have delusions of grandeur,” however , means that you think that your ideas or that you are very important, very powe rful, more important than you actually are.  It’s often something we would associate with someone who

 perhaps has some sort of mental illness – someone who’s crazy.   So Laurent says, “Talk about delusions of grandeur.”  “Talk about” me ans this is a good example of.  “When you start comparing yourself to Shakesp eare, it’s time for you to seek professional help!” meaning when you get to t he point that you are comparing yourself to Shakespeare, it’s time for you “to  seek,” to look for, to get professional help.  Usually, “professional help” refers to  a doctor, especially a psychiatrist or perhaps a psychologist that will help you fin d a problem.  Usually what you are saying is that the other person is crazy.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Laurent:  So I’m confused.  Who’s David again?

Bethany:  David is my roommate’s friend’s brother.  Haven ’t you been listening?

Laurent:  I have, but how am I supposed to keep all of these people straight? Your stories are always so convoluted, with too many twists and turns.  Why don’t you try telling a straightforward story for once?

Bethany:  My stories are only confusing for people who do n’t pay attention or who can’t deal with complexity.

Bethany:  You just don’t appreciate intricate plots.  My stories are crystal clear to anyone who pays attention.  Good stories have lots of det ail.  Just ask Shakespeare.

Laurent:  Talk about delusions of grandeur!  When you st art comparing yourself to Shakespeare, it’s time for you to seek professional he lp!

# Getting a Girlfriend/Boyfriend Back

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 86: Getting a Girlfriend or Boyfriend Back.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 586.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  Go there to download a Learning Guide for this episode that will contain lots of good information to help you improve your English even faster.

This episode is a dialogue between Grace and Yuji.  It’ s called “Getting a Girlfriend or Boyfriend Back,” meaning after you have se parated – broken up, split up, you no longer are boyfriend and girlfriend –  and then you want to get that person back into a relationship.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Grace:  What are you doing?

Yuji:  I’m working on a plan to get April back.

Grace:  I think that’s a lost cause.  You guys broke up thre e months ago.  There’s no way she’ll take you back.

Yuji:  Watch me prove you wrong.  When I tell April ab out all of the ways I’m going to change and to make her happy, she’ll let bygone s be bygones.

Grace:  You’re dreaming.  She won’t be duped by a bun ch of empty promises.

Yuji:  They’re not empty promises.  I really am going to  change, within reason.

Grace:  Do you really think April is going to forget al l of the things you’ve done to her in the past?

Yuji:  I’m not going to rake up the past.  I’m going to show her the new me, and she’ll know I’m sincere.  After all, she used to be crazy ab out me.  I’m sure it’s just a matter of me making the effort.

 Grace:  Pride comes before a fall, you know.  I think you ’d have a better chance if you got down on your knees and begged her for mercy!

[end of dialogue]

Grace begins by asking Yuji, “What are you doing?”  Yuji says, “I’m working on a plan to get April back.”  April was his girlfriend.  “T o get (someone) back” means to convince or persuade someone to continue a romantic re lationship that you had stopped or the other person had stopped.

Grace says, “I think that’s a lost cause.”  A “cause” (cause), as a noun, can be something that you are fighting for, something that you  want to change about the world.  Your cause could be world peace or ending wor ld hunger.  That would be a cause.  The expression “a lost cause” means that you will never be able to accomplish that; it’s impossible for you to do.  We use th is in daily conversation when we see someone trying to do something and we want  to tell them that it would be impossible to do that; we might say, “That’s a lost cause.”  Grace thinks that trying to get April back is a lost cause.  She says, “Yo u guys (meaning you two) broke up three months ago.”  “To break up” mean s to end a romantic relationship.  It’s a phrasal verb meaning you no long er want to be with this other person.  “There’s no way,” Grace says, “April will take you  back.”  “To take (someone) back” is the opposite of “to get (someone) back” in that you are the one who agrees to resume the relationship.  So if I want to get my girlfriend back she would have to take me back; that is, accept that we w ill continue the relationship.

Yuji doesn’t think this is a lost cause.  He says, “Watch me  prove you wrong,” meaning observe me, watch as I prove you wrong.  “To pro ve someone wrong” means to demonstrate that the other person is incorrect – is not right about something.  Yuji says, “When I tell April about all the  ways I’m going to change and to make her happy, she’ll let bygones be bygones.”  S o, Yuji’s plan is to tell April, his ex-girlfriend, how he’s going to change.  T his, of course, is something that men often promise to women: “I’ll change; I’ll b e a different person; I’ll make you happy.”  If this happens, Yuji says, if he tells her th is, then April will let bygones be bygones.  “To let bygones (bygones) be bygones” m eans to ignore or forget about the bad things that have happened in the past, especially if they are painful things that someone did to you.  So for e xample, you may send a poem to your girlfriend, and your girlfriend says, “O h, thank you for the poem. Luis also wrote me a nice poem yesterday.”  Well, that cou ld be something that would be very damaging – something that would hurt yo u very much.  It hurt me – but this is just an example, okay?

 So, Yuji hopes that April will forget about the thin gs, probably the bad things that he did to her.  Grace says, “You’re dreaming,” meaning  you’re imagining something that will not happen.  “She won’t be duped  by a bunch of empty promises.”  Grace is saying that April won’t be duped.  “ To dupe” (dupe) means to fool someone, to make someone believe something that  isn’t true, to trick someone.  When we say, “I won’t be duped,” you mean I won’t let someone else trick me.  “She won’t be duped by a bunch of empty promi ses.”  “A bunch of” means a lot of – many.  A “promise” is when you say to som eone I will do this in the future.  An “empty promise” is something you say you will do, but you aren’t really going to do it.  So in this case, poor Yuji, acco rding to Grace, isn’t going to really do the things he says he’s going to do to change.

Yuji says, “They’re not empty promises.  I’m really going t o change, within reason.”  The expression “within reason” means something t hat isn’t very small but isn’t very large, with moderation, without going t o extremes.  You might say, for example: “I want to help my friend who doesn’t ha ve a job.  I will help him financially, within reason,” meaning I can’t give him 1 00,000 dollars; I’m going to help him but there is a limit to how much I can help him.  That’s really the meaning here.  When someone says “within reason,” often they mean there are certain limits to what I can do.  In this case, Yuji says he’s really going to change, within reason, which makes us think he really isn’t going to change very much. “Reason,” as well as the word “cause,” which we used earl ier, have additional meanings in English; look at our Learning Guide for mo re explanations.

Grace says, “Do you really think April is going to forget all of the things you’ve done to her in the past?”  Yuji says, “I’m not going to  rake up the past.”  “To rake (rake) up the past” means to talk about things that happ ened previously; to make other people remember things they might have forgotte n or ignored, usually bad things that happened in the past.  The verb “rake” is al so used when we are collecting leaves in the autumn – in the fall.  When th ey fall from the tree, you want to get them off of your lawn – off of your fron t yard, and so you use something called a rake, it’s sort of like a broom, and you rake up the leaves. Well in this case, he’s talking about raking up the past.  Taking things out of the past – disturbing them, if you will, so the other perso n will remember them.

Yuji does not want to do this.  He says, “I’m going to show her the new me, and she’ll know I’m sincere.”  Boy, does Yuji not understand w omen!  “To be sincere” (sincere) means to be honest, to be truthful, to reall y mean what you are saying or doing.  He thinks that he can show April the new versi on of him.  He says, “After all, she used to be crazy about me.”  “To be crazy about (someone)”

 means to like or love someone very much, usually in a roman tic way.  You can also be crazy about a thing.  I’m crazy about baseball; I  love to watch baseball. Not as much as I love being with my wife, of course, thou gh it’s close!  Yuji says, “I’m sure it’s just a matter of me making the effort.”  “It’s just a matter of” means the only thing I have to do is make an effort, or make t he effort.  “To make the effort” means to try very hard to do something, even if  you are not successful.

Grace says, “Pride comes before a fall, you know.”  This is an old expression. Pride, meaning someone who is very confident in themselve s – who thinks that they are great, comes before, is something that happens to someone right before there is a fall, when they unsuccessful, when they fail.  It’s basically a warning to people who think that they are great, who are very prou d of what they do that if they aren’t careful they will fail – they will have a fa ll.  Grace says, “I think you’d have a better chance if you got down on your knees and be gged her for mercy!” “To get down on your knees” means to kneel, to put both  knees on the ground. Grace is saying that Yuji should kneel and beg April for mercy.  “To beg (someone) for (something)” means to ask someone to do some thing, especially when it is unlikely that the other person will do it b ecause the other person has all of the power.  “To beg (someone)” means to ask them d esperately.  Well here, Grace is suggesting Yuji will have to beg April for “mer cy,” which here means forgiveness, compassion.  To be nice to another person is m ercy (mercy). Sometimes when little children – boys, I mean – are fig hting, and one boy, for example grabs the arm of another boy and puts it behind  his back to hurt him, the other person might say, “Mercy!” meaning be nice to me; don’t keep hurting me. Grace thinks that April is going to have to have a lot of mercy in order to take Yuji back.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Grace:  What are you doing?

Yuji:  I’m working on a plan to get April back.

Grace:  I think that’s a lost cause.  You guys broke up thre e months ago.  There’s no way she’ll take you back.

Yuji:  Watch me prove you wrong.  When I tell April ab out all of the ways I’m going to change and to make her happy, she’ll let bygone s be bygones.

 Grace:  You’re dreaming.  She won’t be duped by a bun ch of empty promises.

Yuji:  They’re not empty promises.  I really am going to  change, within reason.

Grace:  Do you really think April is going to forget al l of the things you’ve done to her in the past?

Yuji:  I’m not going to rake up the past.  I’m going to show her the new me, and she’ll know I’m sincere.  After all, she used to be crazy ab out me.  I’m sure it’s just a matter of me making the effort.

Grace:  Pride comes before a fall, you know.  I think you ’d have a better chance if you got down on your knees and begged her for mercy!

# Feeling Disillusioned

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 87: Feeling Disillusioned.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 587.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Our website is eslpod.com.  You can to download a Learni ng Guide for this episode, an 8- to 10-page guide that contains all of t he vocabulary, definitions, sample sentences, additional definitions – come on, say it  with me – cultural notes, comprehension questions, and a complete transcript  of everything we say.

This episode is called “Feeling Disillusioned,” about some one who is sad and disappointed in something.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Daniela:  I did it.  I finally met Mandy Timpkin.

Tony:  Mandy Timpkin, your idol?

Daniela:  Yeah, I stood in line for two days at her b ook signing and finally met her.  It was a big disappointment.

Tony:  Really?  I thought she could do no wrong, as far as you’re concerned.

Daniela:  Well, that was before I met her.  I have al ways wanted to be just like her.  She had everything going for her: a great life and a great career.  I emulated her in so many ways.  I thought she must be a paragon of virtue and a great person to be around.  I walked into that bookstore wit h all of these preconceived notions.

Tony:  What happened to shatter your image of her?

Daniela:  While I waited in line, I saw what kind of person she really was.  She was rude to everybody and made ridiculous demands of her assistants.  It wasn’t how I pictured her at all.  She was a real diva.

Tony:  So meeting her really burst your bubble.

 Daniela:  Yeah, it really did.  I guess it was my own fault for putting her on a pedestal.

Tony:  Well, you’re not the only one.  Celebrities woul dn’t be celebrities if we didn’t idolize them.

Daniela:  True enough, and I’ve learned my lesson.  Nob ody’s perfect, least of all celebrities!

[end of dialogue]

Daniela says to Tony, “I did it.  I finally met Mandy Tim pkin.”  Tony says, “Mandy Timpkin, your idol?”  An “idol” (idol) is someone you lo ve, someone you admire; you want to be like that person.  It’s often a famous p erson, it doesn’t have to be. An idol is literally something that you worship, that you  believe has almost special powers.  Some people have idols who are famous politicia ns, famous actors, podcasters perhaps – probably not!  That will be an ido l.  We especially in the U.S. have the term “teen idol,” this would be usually a  very attractive boy – they usually are boys, less than 18 years old, but they could be older – and all of the young girls fall in love with this famous singer.  That w ould be a teen idol.

Well this is just your idol, meaning someone that you adm ire.  Daniela says, “Yeah, I stood in line (I waited) for two days at her book signing and finally met her.”  A “book signing” is an event where the author of  a book “autographs,” or writes his or her name on copies of the book for people who bought it. Bookstores sometimes have a book signings by famous authors; th ey come and they sign the book.  I’ve gone to some of these; they oft en give a little talk, which can be interesting.  Daniela says, however, that meeting  her idol Mandy Timpkin, who is obviously a writer, was a big disappointment.  “ Disappointment” means feeling sad because something that you thought was going  to be good or great was not; it was less than what you thought it would be.  That’s disappointment.

Tony says, “Really?  I thought she could do no wrong, as fa r as you’re concerned.”  When we say someone “can do no wrong” we mea n they are perfect; they cannot make a mistake.  My wife believes I can do no wrong.  Right, honey?  She’s not answering me!  Daniela thought that Mandy Timpkin could do no wrong – was perfect.  Tony says, “as far as you’re conce rned.”  “As far as you’re concerned” or “(someone) is concerned” means in som eone’s opinion, according to this person’s belief.  As far as I’m concerned – as far as what is

 important to me, in my opinion, we have the best listen ers in the world right here at ESL Podcast.  That’s you!

Daniela says, “Well, that was before I met her (I thoug ht she was perfect before I actually had a chance to meet her).”  Daniela says, “I hav e always wanted to be just like her.  She had everything going for her: a gre at life and a great career.” “To have everything going for (someone)” means to be ver y fortunate, to have a lot of advantages, to be very lucky in life.  Well, Danie la says that Mandy had a great life and a great career.  She says she emulated h er in so many ways.  “To emulate” (emulate) means to copy the things that anoth er person does or says, to try to behave just like this other person.  Daniela em ulated, in the past, Mandy. She thought that Mandy must be a paragon of virtue and  a great person to be around.  A “paragon (paragon) of virtue” is someone w ho is perfect in every way, someone who has no flaws, usually someone who has very hig h what we might call moral standards.  Someone who never does anything wr ong: never cheats, never lies, never steals.  That would be a paragon of vir tue.

Well, that’s what Daniela thought Mandy Timpkin was.  S he says, “I walked into that bookstore with all of these preconceived notions.”  A  “notion” (notion) is an idea.  A “preconceived notion” is an idea you have about something without having all of the facts, without being able to actuall y experience or observe what it is you have this idea about.  For example, some peopl e when they come to Los Angeles have a lot of preconceived notions.  They have th ings that they have heard about or read about or seen on TV or in the mo vies that makes them think they know what Los Angeles is like, and then they come here  and it’s very different.  Hollywood Boulevard, for example, which is a  very famous tourist site here in Los Angeles, people have a lot of preconceived n otions about what that’s like.  Well, if you come, you will see!  A preconceived not ion is usually wrong, that’s the implication.

Tony said, “What happened to shatter your image of her ?”  “To shatter” (shatter) means to break something into very small pieces.  It can a lso be used to talk about how your dreams or your hopes were destroyed, how something happened that made them go way, you no longer had this dream or  this hope.  That’s what “shatter” means here.  “Shatter” actually has more defin itions, and those are in the Learning Guide.  Well, Tony wants to know what ha ppened to shatter Daniela’s image of Mandy Timpkin.  “Image,” here, mean s the ways someone appears – someone looks.

Daniela says, “While I waited in line, I saw what kind of person she really was. She was rude (not very nice) to everybody and made ridi culous demands of her

 assistants.”  “Ridiculous” means crazy, not normal, way beyond what you would expect.  A “demand” is something you say you must have.  So , this woman made ridiculous demands on the people who were helping her,  her assistants.  Daniela says, “It wasn’t how I pictured her at all.  She was a re al diva.”  “To picture” means to imagine how something will be.  It has other meanings as well, this word “picture.”  The Learning Guide will tell you mor e.  Well, Daniela found out that Mandy was a real diva (diva).  A “diva” is a woman w ho has a lot of success, usually in singing or acting, but doesn’t treat other pe ople very nicely.  A diva is someone who is great at what they do but is not a very n ice person, and usually diva is applied to a woman.  I guess a man would be a “ divo,” but we never say that, if that’s the correct word.  We usually would call a man a real – well, I can’t say it on the podcast!

Tony says, “So meeting her really burst your bubble.”  Th is expression, “to burst (burst) someone’s bubble,” means to destroy your belief, yo ur hope, the way that you saw something or someone, and now you see it is not a s good or as interesting as you thought it was.  So, it’s another way of saying a great disappointment.  Something burst your bubble; it made you see that you were wrong about what you were hoping for.

Daniela says, “Yeah, it really did.  I guess it was my own fault for putting her on a pedestal.”  “To put (someone) on a pedestal” means to b elieve that someone is perfect, to admire them too much.  A “pedestal” is what  you put a statue of a famous person on.  So to put a person that you know on a pedestal means to think that they are great.

Tony says, “Well, you’re not the only one.  Celebrities wo uldn’t be celebrities (that is, famous people would not be famous) if we did n’t idolize them.”  “To idolize” (idolize) is a verb that comes from the first wo rd we talked about, “idol.”  It means to admire someone too much, to think that someone  is perfect.  Daniela says, “True enough (meaning I agree, you’re right), and  I’ve learned my lesson (meaning now I have learned that I was wrong).  Nobod y’s perfect, least of all celebrities!”  “Least of all” means especially; it’s a phra se used to give emphasis to the words that follow it.  So, “Nobody’s perfect, le ast of all celebrities” means celebrities are probably the least perfect or the most f lawed of anyone.

The title of the dialogue was “Feeling Disillusioned. ”  “To be disillusioned” means that you have dreams about how great something is and th en you are disappointed.  Usually, to be disillusioned means that you  had a vision – you had a picture of the way a situation was going to be or go ing to turn out, and then you were very bitterly, we might say, disappointed – greatly disappointed.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Daniela:  I did it.  I finally met Mandy Timpkin.

Tony:  Mandy Timpkin, your idol?

Daniela:  Yeah, I stood in line for two days at her b ook signing and finally met her.  It was a big disappointment.

# Hiring Business Consultants

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 88: Hiring Business Consultants.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episode 588.  I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educa tional Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

This episode is a dialogue between Erica and Stefan.  I t is about a business that wants to hire people from outside of the company to come  and give the company some advice or some help.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Erica:  So your suggestion is to hire outside consultants t o handle the extra work associated with the expansion.

Stefan:  I think there are a lot of benefits: we ge t someone with the right expertise quickly, we can use him or her as needed, and we can save on  employment taxes and benefits.  What’s not to like?

Erica:  I’m just not sure that’s the right move right no w.

Stefan:  To me, it’s a no-brainer.  We call the shots.  If we don’t like the consultant’s work, then we can terminate our relationship  at any time.

Erica:  Yes, but that also means that the consultant won ’t feel any company loyalty and could quit working with us whenever he or sh e wanted to, leaving us in a lurch.

Stefan:  That’s true, but that’s also true of any emplo yee.  Company loyalty is a thing of the past.  I really think we should move ahead .

 Erica:  Well, I think we should take it one step at a time.  Start with contracting consultants for smaller projects and see how they do before  we have them work on this big one.

Stefan:  Okay, I can live with that, as long as we don’t drag our feet in getting people started on the big project.

Erica:  Don’t worry.  If I drag my feet, I know you’ll tow me along.

[end of dialogue]

Erica begins by saying to Stefan, “So your suggestion is to hire outside consultants to handle the extra work associated with the e xpansion.”  “To hire” means to employ, to pay someone to work for you.  A “cons ultant” is a person whose job it is to give advice, based on their knowledge and experience.  It could also be a person that a company hires for a temporary per iod, say a few months, to do specific work, and afterwards the consultant goes aw ay.  The consultant, in those cases, is often not technically an employee of the comp any, but someone who is working for another business – a consulting firm o r a consulting company, and that company gets paid by the company that hires them , and then the consulting company pays their employee, the consultant.

Stefan suggests hiring consultants to do some extra work “ associated,” or related to the expansion.  “Expansion” means growth, increase in si ze.  It’s often used to talk about a business that is getting bigger, that is per haps opening new stores and so forth.  Stefan says, “I think there are a lot of benefits (that is, a lot of benefits to hiring consultants): we get someone with the right expertise quickly, we can use him or her as needed, and we can save on empl oyment taxes and benefits.  What’s not to like?”  “Expertise” is your specia l knowledge about one particular topic.  Stefan wants to get someone with the “right expertise,” meaning the expertise that we need.  They can use that person “as needed,” meaning when and how you need them, and only when you need the m.  He’s also saying that the company can save on employment taxes and benefit s.  “Benefits” are things that a company gives an employee in addition to mo ney.  Health insurance, for example, vacation time, money for retire ment; these are possible benefits.

Now in the U.S., if you are a company that has employees,  the company has to pay special taxes to the government.  However, if you hire  someone to work temporarily in your company – and there are other rules you have to follow – you can consider this person not an employee of your company, b ut what we would

 call an “independent contractor,” someone who signs a cont ract with you for a specific job that they do.  And as I say, there are other requirements, but that’s one of the advantages of hiring outside consultants.

Stefan says, “What’s not to like?”  This is a phrase we use when we think that our particular idea or decision will only have positive results.   There’s nothing negative that could happen: “What’s not to like?”  For  example, you may find that someone is going to go to Harvard and they receive a full  scholarship, meaning Harvard will pay all of their expenses.  You might say, “W ell, what’s not to like? You go to a great school and you don’t have to pay anyth ing.”  Or a man may see a beautiful woman walking down the street and comm ent to his friend, “Wow, that’s a very attractive woman,” and the friend would sa y, “Well, yeah.  What’s not to like?”  I mean yes, there’s nothing negative to say.

Erica says, “I’m just not sure that’s the right move (that ’s the right decision) right now,” to hire consultants.  Stefan says, “To me (in my op inion), it’s a no-brainer.” A “no-brainer” (brainer) is something that is so obvious you don’t have to think about it; you don’t have to use your brain about it beca use everyone knows this is the right thing to do.  Stefan thinks that that is w hat the decision to hire outside consultants is.  He says, “We call the shots.”  “To call the sh ots” (shots) means that you make the decision; you are the one who decides.  “Who’s calling shots around here?” meaning who’s the boss, who’s the person  in charge?  Stefan says, “If we don’t like the consultant’s work, then we can t erminate our relationship at any time.”  “To terminate” means to en d, to stop something; in this case, to end the contract you have with the consultant.  You can also use this with an employee: “We’re going to terminate this empl oyee,” we’re going to fire them.  Or, “The employee has been terminated by the com pany.”  This is not related to the movie The Terminator , where our now governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was a star of.  Nothing to do with that ; you don’t actually kill them.  “Terminate” could mean to kill someone as well.  But that’s not what we’re talking about, at least at most companies – I’m not sure  here about the Center for Educational Development!

Erica says, “Yes (we could terminate our relationship at any time), but that also means that the consultant won’t feel any company loyalty.”   “Company loyalty” is a feeling that you are part of this family – this compan y, this group of people – and you want to help them be successful.  “Loyalty,” in ge neral, is a feeling of connectedness, that you are connected and want to help wha tever group we’re talking about, whether it’s your company, your family, or even your country. Erica adds that this consultant could quit, or stop workin g with us whenever he or she wanted to, leaving us in a lurch.  “To leave (someon e) in a lurch” (lurch)

 means to abandon someone when he or she needs your help,  to stop helping someone at an important time.  You start helping them , and then you decide, “Eh, I’m tired.  I’m going to go home,” and they have  all this work to do or they need this help that you haven’t given them.  You’re le aving them in a lurch.

Stefan says, “That’s true, but that’s also true of any emp loyee.  Company loyalty is a thing of the past.”  To say something is “a thing of the past” means that it no longer exists; it was once true, but it is no longer true .  For many people writing letters, or typing letters on a typewriter, is a thing of the past; they don’t do it anymore.  Actually, I’ve been thinking of buying a typewri ter – an old, manual typewriter just for fun.  I kind of miss it in some ways.

Stefan thinks that company loyalty is a thing of the past.  He says, “I think we should move ahead” – “I really think we should move ahead .”  Erica says, “Well, I think we should take it one step at a time.”  To take (so mething) one step at a time” means to do something slowly, gradually; a little bit at a time, not everything all at once, not everything right now.  She suggests they start with contracting consultants for smaller projects and see how they do.  “To contract” means to sign an official, legal agreement between two people;  usually it’s a company hiring someone else, an independent contractor, to do work.  So, “to contract” as a verb is when you pay money to someone else, and you typical ly will sign a document, a piece of paper that is a contract.  There “co ntract” is both a verb and a noun; the piece of paper is the contract – the agreem ent is the contract. “Contact” actually has even more meanings, and those are i n your Learning Guide.

Stefan says, “Okay, I can live with that.”  When someone sa ys they can “live with” something, they mean it’s acceptable; it’s not what  I wanted, but it’s okay, that’s something I will be able to work with.  Stefan says, however, that he can live with that as long as we don’t drag our feet in ge tting people started on the big project.  “To drag (drag) your feet” means to do someth ing very slowly, to delay, to purposely not do things as fast as you should do them.

Erica says, “Don’t worry.  If I drag my feet, I know you’ ll tow me along.”  “To tow (tow) (someone or something) along” means to pull som eone or something in a particular direction.  The verb “to tow” is one we use, for example, when you have one car that isn’t working and another car that is working, and you connect a chain or a cable, and the car that is working pulls – w e would say “tows” the other car.  If you have your car and you have a big truck that you can put the car onto, that’s another way of towing the car.  We call the trucks that do that “tow

 trucks.”  Well here, “to tow (someone) along” means to m ove someone in a particular direction so that they don’t go too slowly.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Erica:  So your suggestion is to hire outside consultants t o handle the extra work associated with the expansion.

Stefan:  I think there are a lot of benefits: we ge t someone with the right expertise quickly, we can use him or her as needed, and we can save on  employment taxes and benefits.  What’s not to like?

Erica:  I’m just not sure that’s the right move right no w.

Stefan:  To me, it’s a no-brainer.  We call the shots.  If we don’t like the consultant’s work, then we can terminate our relationship  at any time.

# Having Skin Problems

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 5 89: Having Skin Problems.

This episode is a dialogue between a doctor and the mot her of young boy. They’re going to be talking about the problems that th is young boy has with his skin – the medical problems.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Mother:  Doctor, this is my son Danny.  I brought him i n so you could look at his rash.

Doctor:  Okay, Danny.  Have a seat on the exam table.  H ow long have you had the rash?

Mother:  My son has had that rash for about two weeks.  I t started out as a blister, and then it got really itchy and turned red.  Could it be an infection?

Doctor:  I’ll need to take a closer look at it first bef ore I can tell you that.

Mother:  I hope it’s not anything serious.  I hope it’s not skin cancer!

Doctor:  Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  Okay, let’s ta ke a look…

Mother:  While you’re at it, could you look at this bum p on Danny’s neck?  I think it’s a mole.

Doctor:  That looks like a birthmark, but I’ll take a l ook.

Mother:  And could you look at this wart?  If you remo ve it, will it leave a scar?

 Doctor:  I’m not sure it is a wart.  Let me examine it first, and I’ll tell you what treatment I recommend.

Mother:  Oh, and Doctor, could you look at Danny’s pimple s?  He just started getting them.  I had really bad acne when I was his age .

Doctor:  Is there anything else?

Mother:  Well, since you asked…

[end of dialogue]

We begin with the mother saying, “Doctor, this is my son D anny.  I brought him in (I brought him here) so you could look at his rash (rash ).”  A “rash” is when you have a group of red – small red marks on your skin, often times they are itchy. You feel like you need to take one of your hands and move  it rapidly across the rash back and forth to stop this feeling of itchiness.  We  would call that “scratching” the itch.

Well, that’s what Danny has.  The doctor says, “Okay, Danny.   Have a seat on the exam table.”  The “exam table,” or the “examinati on table” – “exam” is just short for “examination” – is sort of a bed-like table in  a doctor’s office where the patient can sit or lie down so the doctor can look at the  patient.  The doctor says, “How long have you had the rash?”  Now he asked that to  the boy, Danny, but the mother responds instead.  “My son has had that rash for about two weeks.  It started out as a blister, but then it got really itchy a nd turned red.”  “To start out” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to begin in a certai n way.  Especially we use the expression “to start out,” this phrasal verb, when some thing begins one way, then at the end there’s a different result; something  changes: “She started out working as a waitress in a restaurant, and after a few ye ars she was in the movies.”  Typical Los Angeles story, I guess.  Usually they cont inue to be waiters and waitresses for the rest of their lives.  But in the Hollywood version, you start as a lowly employee working at a café, and then you are  suddenly a big movie star.  I’m waiting for that to happen to me!  That’s what “to start out” means. There are actually meanings of this expression, and those ca n be found in today’s Learning Guide.  A “blister” (blister) is a small  area of your skin that is raised; it’s a little higher up than the other skin aro und it and there’s liquid inside. Typically if you are wearing shoes, for example, that are too tight and your foot is rubbing against the tight shoes you may develop – you may get a blister on your foot.  “Itchy” (itchy) we mentioned earlier; it’s the sen sation – the feeling that you want to scratch something, that you want to take your hand  and your fingernails

 and put it over the skin, rubbing it back and forth.  Th at’s the sensation of something being itchy.

The son has something that started out as a blister, and then it got really itchy and turned red.  “Could it be an infection?” the mot her asks.  An “infection” is a medical condition caused by bacteria entering some part of your body.  It makes you sicker; it’s a kind of illness, we could say.  The mother  is wondering whether this rash, that started out as a blister, is an infection.   The doctor says, “I’ll need to take a closer look at it first before I can tell you  that.”  He needs to examine it. The mother says, “I hope it’s not anything serious.  I ho pe it’s not skin cancer!” “Skin cancer” is a serious disease where you have what are ca lled cancerous cells that multiply – that grow.  This happens sometimes if you get too much sun, you can get skin cancer.  Skin cancer is usually caught early, a nd if it is it’s not a problem to get rid of it; it’s not like some of the o ther kinds of cancer.

The doctor said, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”  The  mother is worried that the son has cancer, and the doctor is telling her not to get ahead of herself.  That is, don’t start making plans or doing things before you r eally understand what you have to do.  You don’t have enough information to make  a decision yet; that’s to get ahead of yourself.  The mother immediately thinks the worst.  The doctor says, “let’s take a look,” and again the mother interrupt s and says, “While you’re at it,” meaning while you are doing that, you are aski ng them to do something else.  In this case, the mother wants him to look at th is bump (bump) on Danny’s neck.  She says, “I think it’s a mole.”  A “bump” is a small , raised area of something; it could be on your skin.  There could be a bu mp on your desk, if there was a problem with your desk.  It’s not completel y flat or smooth.  This is a bump on Danny’s neck, which the mother thinks might be a mole (mole).  Here, a “mole” means a small, dark, usually brown mark on your skin .  It’s usually slightly raised – it’s usually a bit higher than the skin around it, though that isn’t always the case.

The doctor says, “That looks like a birthmark, but I’ll ta ke a look.”  A “birthmark” (one word) is an area of your skin that is a different co lor than the area around it, and that’s the way it has been since you were born – your  skin has always been that way.  We call those things birthmarks.  I have a bir thmark on the back of my head, which no one could ever see until I shaved my head.  I took all the hair off of my head and there it was.  It’s kind of scary looking a ctually, but it’s okay.  I tell people it’s a tattoo, which it isn’t!

The mother says then, “And could you look at this wart?  If you remove it, will it leave a scar?”  A “wart” (wart) is a small spot on your skin  that is dark, not usually

 brown.  It’s raised up above the rest of the skin, and i t is typically very hard.  It’s almost like you have a very hard piece of rock on your skin.   That’s called a wart. A “scar” is what can happen sometimes when you cut you skin i f it’s a deep cut – a serious one.  Sometimes after the “wound,” the openi ng in your skin, has healed – has become better, there’s a little mark our yo ur skin where you cut it. That would be a scar.  So the doctor is being asked if h e removes the wart will that will leave a scar on little Danny’s skin.

The doctor says, “I’m not sure it is a wart.  Let me exami ne it first, and I’ll tell you what treatment I recommend.”  Of course, the mother w on’t let the doctor actually do his job and examine the patient, Danny.  “Treatment ” is what you do to cure a disease or to fix an injury that you have; that’s how it’ s used here.  The doctor says I can’t tell you the treatment until I look at it.  The mother says, “Oh, and Doctor, could you look at Danny’s pimples?  He just started getting them.  I had really bad acne when I was his age.”  So, the mother is  having the doctor look at yet another thing, that’s Danny’s pimples.  A “pimple” ( pimple) is sometimes informally called a “zit” (zit), but “pimple” is a littl e nicer sounding word.  It’s a small, red spot often on your face that might be caused  by having too much oil in your skin.  It’s something that happens to teenagers quit e frequently, but it can also happen to adults.

Well, Danny has pimples, and he just started getting the m.  The mother said that I had really bad acne but I was his age.  “Acne” (acne) is a skin condition were you have lots of different pimples on your skin, especially yo ur face and your neck.  Again, that’s the general condition of having pim ples; it’s called having acne.

The doctor says, “Is there anything else?”  The mother says, “Well, since you asked.”  The phrase “since you asked” means that you have ano ther question or you have more information, but you were waiting for the other person to indicate some interest.  You weren’t going to ask them or tell t hem, but since they asked you, well then, you are going to ask the question or give  the information.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

[start of dialogue]

Mother:  Doctor, this is my son Danny.  I brought him i n so you could look at his rash.

 Doctor:  Okay, Danny.  Have a seat on the exam table.  H ow long have you had the rash?

Mother:  My son has had that rash for about two weeks.  I t started out as a blister, and then it got really itchy and turned red.  Could it be an infection?

Doctor:  I’ll need to take a closer look at it first bef ore I can tell you that.

Mother:  I hope it’s not anything serious.  I hope it’s not skin cancer!

Doctor:  Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  Okay, let’s ta ke a look…

Mother:  While you’re at it, could you look at this bum p on Danny’s neck?  I think it’s a mole.

Doctor:  That looks like a birthmark, but I’ll take a l ook.

Mother:  And could you look at this wart?  If you remo ve it, will it leave a scar?

Doctor:  I’m not sure it is a wart.  Let me examine it first, and I’ll tell you what treatment I recommend.

Mother:  Oh, and Doctor, could you look at Danny’s pimple s?  He just started getting them.  I had really bad acne when I was his age .

Doctor:  Is there anything else?

Mother:  Well, since you asked…

[start of dialogue]  Justine:  So that’s the plan.  We drive to San Francisco, then to Portland, then to Seattle, and then to Vancouver.  Howie:  What?  Why are we driving to Vancouver instead of flying?  Justine:  Haven’t you noticed all of the fees the airlines are tacking on these days?  First, there were the fuel surcharges and now, there is a whole slew of added fees.  Howie:  Like what?  Justine:  Well, there’s a checked baggage fee, for one.  On some airlines, you have to pay to check just one bag, and each additional bag is another fee.  If you have oversize or overweight bags, that’s another fee.  Howie:  Okay, I don’t like fees either, but I don’t think that justifies driving all the way to Vancouver.    Justine:  Well, let me tell you about some of the other fees.  Do you want a snack or a meal on the flight?  You’re going to have to shell out for those now.  Do you want to fly standby?  Yes, it used to be free, but not anymore.

Things may not be as sharp as I’d like them to be, but I can still make out people and objects – as long as they’re really big.  Hamed:  I don’t think your coworkers are going to want you to blindside them today with your strange behavior.  You’re going to do more harm than good.  Sue:  I can see well enough.  I only see double if I move my head like this.  Whoa…  Hamed:  At this point, I don’t care if you have X-ray vision.  That medication is affecting more than your vision.  It’s impairing your better judgment!  [end of dialogue]
