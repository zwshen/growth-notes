<P>
Playing games is the most fun if other people take part. But other players are not always available
if you need them, which led to the invention of single-player games. One of the most well-known
examples is the infamous ``Solitaire'' packaged with Windows, probably responsible for more wasted
hours in offices around the world than any other game.

<P>
The goal of a single-player game is usually to make ``moves'' until one reaches a final state of
the game, which results in a win or loss, or a score assigned to that final state. Most players try to
optimize the result of the game by employing good strategies. In this problem we are interested in
what happens if one plays randomly. After all, these games are mostly used to waste time, and playing
randomly achieves this goal as well as any other strategy.

<P>
Games can very compactly represented as (possibly infinite) trees. Every node of the tree repre-
sents a possible game state. The root of the tree corresponds to the starting position of the game. For
an inner node, its children are the game states to which one can move in a single move. The leaf nodes
are the final states, and every one of them is assigned a number, which is the score one receives when
ending up at that leaf.

Trees are defined using the following grammar.

<P>
By using a <EM>Definition</EM>, the <EM>RealTree</EM> on the right-hand side of the
equation is assigned to the <EM>Identifier</EM> on the left. A <EM>RealTree</EM>
consists of a root node and one or more children, given as a sequence enclosed
in brackets. And a <EM>Tree</EM> is either

<P>
<UL>
<LI>the tree represented by a given <EM>Identifier</EM>, or

<P>
<LI>a leaf node, represented by a single <EM>Integer</EM>, or

<P>
<LI>an inner node, represented by a sequence of one or more <EM>Trees</EM> (its
children), enclosed in brackets.
</UL>

<P>
Your goal is to compute the expected score, if one plays randomly, i.e. at each inner node selects
one of the children uniformly at random. This expected score is well-defined even for the infinite trees
definable in our framework as long as the probability that the game ends (playing randomly) is 1.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input file contains several gametree descriptions. Each description starts with a line containing
the number <I>n</I> of identifiers used in the description. The identifiers used will be the first <I>n</I> lowercase
letters of the alphabet. The following <I>n</I> lines contain the definitions of these identifiers (in the order
<TT>a</TT>, <TT>b</TT>, ...). Each definition may contain arbitrary whitespace
(but of course there will be no spaces within a single integer). The right
hand side of a definition will contain only identifiers from the first <I>n</I>
lowercase letters.
The inputs ends with a test case starting with <I>n</I> = 0. This test case should
not be processed.

<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For each gametree description in the input, first output the number of the
game. Then, for all <I>n</I> identifiers in the order <TT>a</TT>, <TT>b</TT>, ...,
output the following. If an identifier represents a gametree for which the
probability of finishing the game is 1, print the expected score (when playing
randomly). This value should be exact to three digits to the right of the
decimal point.

<P>
If the game described by the variable does not end with probability 1, print
``<TT>Expected score of id undefined</TT>'' instead.
Output a blank line after each test case.
