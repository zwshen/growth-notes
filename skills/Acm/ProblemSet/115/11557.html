<P>
While reviewing code recently being checked into the repository, Jim
discovered that some employees now and then seemed to copy code right
from the Internet into the company code base. This would be a potential
disaster as the company then risks getting sued by copyright holders of
the original code. The obvious solution, talking to the employees and
kindly ask them not to submit any stolen code, seemed to solve the
problem. Still, it was decided that a screening process should be
introduced to detect newly stolen code.

<P>
The screening would work as follows: Every time new code was checked in,
the full contents of the changed files where matched against a
repository of known open source code. For each file the longest match,
in number of consecutive lines, should be reported.

<P>
Comparison is done line by line. Empty lines, and lines only containing
space, are ignored during comparison and not counted.
Leading and trailing spaces should be ignored completely and consecutive
space characters inside the lines are treated as one single space.
The comparison is case-sensitive.

<P>

The input file contains several test cases, each of them    as described below.

<P>
Test data starts with the number <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<IMG

<tex2html_verbatim_mark> of code fragments in the
repository. Then follows, for each code fragment, one line
containing the file name that the fragment was fetched from
and the contents of the fragment on subsequent lines. File names
will neither contain whitespace nor be guaranteed to be unique. The name
is at most 254 characters long.
Each fragment is terminated by <TT>***END***</TT> on
a line by its own. This line is not considered being part of the
fragment.

<P>
After the fragments in the repository have all been listed, comes the
actual code snippet to find matches for. This snippet is also
terminated by <TT>***END***</TT> on a line by its own.

<P>
Lines are guaranteed to be no longer than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">254</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> characters. No code
fragment will be longer than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10000</SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines. Any code and file name lines
will only contain the ASCII characters 32-126. 
The total size of the input file will not exceed <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10<SUP>6</SUP></SPAN>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> characters.

<P>
For each test case, write to the output, on a line by itself, the number of matching consecutive lines
(empty lines not counted) in a longest match from the repository,
followed by a space-separated list of the file names of each
fragments containing a match of this length, given in the order that the
matching fragments were presented in the repository description.
If no fragments match, write the number 0 on a line of its own.
