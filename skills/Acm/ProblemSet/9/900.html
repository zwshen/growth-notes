<H1 align="center">Brick Wall Patterns</H1>
</font>

<P align="justify">
If we want to build a brick wall out of the usual size of brick which
has a length twice as long as its height, and if our wall is to be two
units tall, we can make our wall in a number of patterns, depending on
how long we want it. From the figure one observe that:

<ul>
<li> There is just one wall pattern which is 1 unit wide - made by
putting the brick on its end. 
<li> There are 2 patterns for a wall of length 2: two side-ways
bricks laid on top of each other and two bricks long-ways up put next
to each other. 
<li> There are three patterns for walls of length 3.
</ul>

How many patterns can you find for a wall of length 4? And, for a wall
of length 5?

Your task is to write a program that given the length of a wall,
determines how many patterns there may be for a wall of that length.


<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Intput</H2></FONT>

Your program receives a sequence of positive integers, one per line,
each representing the length of a wall. The maximum value for the wall
is length 50. The input terminates with a 0.

<FONT color="#0000FF"><H2>Output</H2></FONT>

For each wall length given in the input, your program must output the
corresponding number of different patterns for such a wall in a
separate line.
