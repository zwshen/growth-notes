If S is a multiple of nine, then so is N. This is a recursive test, and the depth of the recursion needed to obtain the answer on N is called the 9-degree of N.<BR><BR>Your job is, given a positive number N, determine if it is a multiple of nine and,if it is, its 9-degree.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4><B>Description of the input</B></FONT><B><BR></B><BR>The input is a file such that each line contains a positive number. A line containing the number 0 is the end of the input.
