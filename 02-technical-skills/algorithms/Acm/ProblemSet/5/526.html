<P>
String Distance is a non-negative integer that measures the distance
between two strings. Here we
give the definition. A transform list is a list of strings, where each
string, except for the last one, can
be changed to the string followed by adding a character, deleting a
character or replacing a
character. The length of a transform list is the count of strings
minus 1 (that is the count of
operations to transform these two strings). The distance between two strings
is the length of a
transform list from one string to the other with the minimal length. You
are to write a program to
calculate the distance between two strings and give the corresponding
transform list.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
Input consists a sequence of string pairs, each string pair consists two
lines, each string occupies
one line. The length of each string will be no more than 80.

For each string pair, you should give an integer to indicate the length
between them at the first line,
and give a sequence of command to transform string1 to string 2. Each
command is a line lead by
command count, then the command. A command must be

where <I>pos</I> is the position of the string and <I>pos</I> should be between 1 and
the current length of the
string (in <TT>Insert</TT> command, <I>pos</I> can be 1 greater than the length), and value is a character. Actually
many command lists can satisfy the request, but only one of them is required.
