This episode is called “Having Trouble Making a Decision.”  It’s a dialogue between Lorenzo and Katia; they’re talking about buying  a new television and all of the things that they need to think about.  We’ll be  hearing a lot of expressions that you might use when you are talking about making a d ifficult decision.  Let’s get started. 

[start of dialogue] 

Lorenzo:  Have you bought a new television yet? 

Katia:  No, I’m still looking at consumer reviews and wei ghing my options.  I’m not sure yet what size I want or what features I need.  I’m keeping my options open for now.   

Lorenzo:  I thought your old TV stopped working three w eeks ago.  You still haven’t made up your mind about buying a new one? 

Katia:  Oh, I’ve decided to buy a new one.  It’s which one I’m going to buy that’s making me hesitate.  There are so many options to choose from.  I want to approach this logically and decide only after I’ve done t he proper analysis.    

Lorenzo:  It’s only a TV.  It’s not like it’s a house or e ven a car.   

Katia:  I know, but I’m the one who has to live with t he decision.  I’ll look at it every day, and if I don’t make the right decision, it’ll haunt me for years. 

Lorenzo:  You know what I think? 

Katia:  What?  

 Lorenzo:  I think you’re crippled by indecision, and you’ re stalling.  The sooner you make a decision and buy a new TV, the better. 

Katia:  Hey, what are you doing?  Where are you taking  me? 

Lorenzo:  We’re going to the electronics store this minut e, and you’re buying a TV – today! 

Katia:  What if I regret my decision? 

Lorenzo:  Then I’ll buy you a new one. 

Katia:  Fine, but I’m holding you to that!

Lorenzo begins our dialogue asking Katia, “Have you bough t a new television yet?”  Katia says, “No, I’m still looking at consumer revi ews and weighing my options.”  What a lot of people do now, especially with  the Internet, before they buy something they look to see what other people think about it – what their opinion is.  If you buy a book on Amazon.com, there are all sorts of reviews – customer or consumer reviews.  “Customer” and “consumer” mea n the same thing, the person who buys something.  So you can look at  their opinion, that’s what their “review” is, their opinion about this produ ct or service. 

Katia says she’s still looking at consumer reviews and weighin g her options.  “To weigh (weigh) your options” means to carefully consider a ll of your choices to determine which one is best.  That’s weighing your optio ns.  Sometimes, of course, you don’t have very many options, so you don’t have m uch to weigh! Katia says, “I’m not sure what size I want or what featur es I need.”  “Features” are things that a product offers you.  It might be a co lor television, that could be a feature.  Or, it might be a television that has a digi tal video recorder, that would be a feature.  Katia says, “I’m keeping my options open f or now.”  To keep your options (your choices) open” means not to make a decision ye t; wait until you have looked at all the possibilities – all of the option s.  So, “to keep your options open” means think about it some more, wait until you ha ve more information. 

Lorenzo says, “I thought your old TV stopped working thre e weeks ago.  You still haven’t made up your mind about buying a new one?”  L orenzo’s a little surprised since Katia has not had a television for three weeks.  He says, “You still haven’t made up your mind.”  “To make up your mind ” means to make a  

 decision.  Sometimes we use that expression when someone i s having difficulty making a decision and you are getting impatient, you wan t them to hurry up.  You may say, “Oh, make up your mind.”  Make a decision – make up your mind. 

Katia says, “Oh, I’ve decided to buy a new one,” that’s he r decision, “It’s which one I’m going to buy that’s making me hesitate.”  “To h esitate” means to delay, not to do something right away.  She says, “There are so many options (so many possibilities – choices) to choose from.  I want to approa ch this logically and decide only after I’ve done the proper analysis.”  To do  something “logically” means to do it rationally, following clear thinking.  “ Analysis” is when you do careful research and examination of something to underst and it better.  A scientist would do analysis on the results of his or her stud y.  That’s analysis; analysis just means to think about it, to look at all the information, to make careful judgments about it. 

Lorenzo thinks that Katia is being too careful.  He says, “ It’s only a TV,” meaning it’s not that important, “It’s not like it’s a house or  even a car.”  A house and a car are much bigger purchases – much more expensive, so you migh t think about them more.  A television is less important, and so you pro bably don’t need to think about it all that much, but Katia does.  She says, “I know, but I’m the one who has to live with the decision.”  “To live with the d ecision” means to accept the consequences – the results of what you decided.  If you  buy a small car, and then you want to take all of your friends to the beach,  well, that’s not going to be possible.  You have to live with your decision.  In this case, it could mean a good thing; it could mean a bad thing. 

Katia says, “I’ll look at it every day, and if I don’t ma ke the right decision, it’ll haunt me for years.”  “To haunt (haunt) (someone)” me ans that someone is bothered, worried, or concerned about something bad t hat happened in the past, or about a bad decision that you’ve made and you continu e to think about it.  It haunts you – you’re reminded of it every day or very freque ntly.  Katia’s worried about making the wrong decision because she doesn’t want i t to haunt her for years. 

Lorenzo says, “You know what I think?”  Katia says, “What? ”  Lorenzo says, “I think you’re crippled by indecision, and you’re stalling. ”  “To be crippled” (crippled) means, in this case, to be unable to do somet hing, to be unable to work properly or correctly.  The word “cripple” has a coup le of different meanings in English however, so take a look at the Learning Guide  for some more explanations.  “Indecision” is the inability to make a deci sion, the inability to decide, when you can’t decide because, for whatever reason,  you are unable to. So, Lorenzo is saying that Katia is crippled by indecision; she can’t do anything  

 because she can’t decide, and so she’s stalling.  “To stall”  (stall) means to delay in doing something, usually to do other, less important things because you don’t want to do the thing you’re supposed to do.  You’re d elaying it; you’re waiting longer and longer to do it.  “Stall,” like “cripple, ” has a couple of different meanings, so take a look at the Learning Guide for some  explanations of that. 

Lorenzo says, “The sooner you make a decision and buy a ne w TV, the better.” Katia says, “Hey, what are you doing?  Where are you takin g me?”  Lorenzo says, “We’re going to the electronics store this minute, a nd you’re buying a TV – today!”  Lorenzo is taking her to the electronics store, a story that sells televisions, radios, telephones, computers perhaps – thing s that are electronic in nature.  They’re going to the electronics store this minu te, meaning immediately, right now, and you’re going to buy a TV today, he says. 

Katia says, “What if I regret my decision?”  “To regret” is to wish that you hadn’t done something, to wish that something had not happene d.  When someone thinks you’re making the wrong decision they may say to you, “you’re going to regret that decision,” you’ll regret it.  They might e ven say “you’ll live to regret it,” meaning you may not regret it immediately, but in the future you’ll look back and say “I made a mistake.”  So “to regret” something is to r ealize that you’ve made a mistake, to wish that you had made a different decision.   

Katia says, “What if I regret my decision?”  Lorenzo says, “T hen I’ll buy you a new one,” meaning a new television.  Katia says, “Fine ( meaning okay), but I’m holding you to that!”  “To hold (someone) to (somethi ng)” means to make someone keep a promise, to make sure that the person is g oing to do what they say they are going to do.  If you tell your children you’r e going to take them to a movie this weekend your children are probably going to h old you to it, meaning on Friday or Saturday you can’t say, “Oh, you know what ki ds?  We’re not going to go to a movie.”  Well, your children will not be ver y happy, I don’t think! 

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.
