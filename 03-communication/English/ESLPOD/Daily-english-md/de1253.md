This episode is a dialogue between Carl and Doris a bout ridesharing services – businesses that allow you to take a taxi without ta king a taxi. I’ll explain when we get to the explanation. For now, let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Carl: Let’s get a taxi.

Doris: There’s no need. I’ve already ordered a car.

Carl: A limo? That’s too expensive.

Doris: No, I’m using a ridesharing service. It’s ch eaper than a taxi. There’s no meter and we pay a set price.

Carl: But how do we know it’s safe? How do we know the driver isn’t a criminal or an unsafe driver? Is he going to have car insurance ? Do they do background checks?

Doris: Even though it’s a peer-to-peer service, the  drivers are carefully screened and the cars are tracked. Trust me. This ride will be safe.

Carl: We don’t have much cash on us.

Doris: I have a credit card on file. No cash will c hange hands. Look, here’s our driver. Hello, Michael.

Carl: You know our driver?

Doris: He’s my son.

 Carl: But why are you paying for a ride if your son  is available to pick us up?

Doris: He has his pride. He won’t take any money fr om me so we came up with a compromise: I hire his car whenever I need a ride to or from the airport. It works for us and there’s a bonus.

Carl: What’s that?

Doris: I get to see my son every time I travel.

Carl: That seems like a strange arrangement.

Doris: That may be so, but if you can’t get your so n to visit more often, what’s a mother to do?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with Carl saying to Doris, “Let ’s get a taxi.” A “taxi” (taxi) is a “taxicab” – a car that you can ride in and pay mone y to take you from one place to another. Doris says, “There’s no need,” meaning we don’t have to get a taxi. She says, “I’ve already ordered a car.” She has alr eady arranged for them to be taken from where they are now to where they want to  go, but not in a taxi.

A “taxi” is a car that, in many cities, you can sim ply wave your hand at and it will stop and allow you to get in and take you to where you want to go. In some cities, like Los Angeles, you actually have to call to get a taxi or to go to a place where there are already taxis waiting for you, called a “ taxi stand” (stand). Taxi stands in Los Angeles can be found at the airport as well as in front of some big hotels.

However, one way of getting from where you want to go is, instead of calling a taxi, to call for a limo. A “limo” (limo) is a “lim ousine,” which is a very nice car, often a very long car, that is more comfortable tha n a taxi. In Los Angeles, you can call for a taxi or you can call and get a limo to come and pick you up from your house. “Limos,” or “limousines,” are more expe nsive. That’s why Carl says, “A limo? That’s too expensive.”

Doris didn’t say she ordered a limo. She said she o rdered a car. Until recently, if someone said they “ordered a car,” you would think that they had ordered a limo. But nowadays you can order a car that’s not a limo.  Doris explains – she says, “I’m using a ridesharing service.” “Ridesharing” (r idesharing) is a service where

people who don’t have a taxi license, who are just regular people who own cars, will give you a ride and you pay them for that ride .

“It’s cheaper than a taxi,” Doris explains, which it is. If you use one of these ridesharing services, you call them up or go on you r phone with an app and order a car to come and pick you up. Someone drives his o wn car, picks you up, and takes you to where you want to go. Doris says, “The re’s no meter and we pay a set price.” A “meter” (meter) here refers to a mach ine, a device, that calculates or figures out how much you have to pay your taxi driv er.

Taxi drivers in most cities use meters. So, they tu rn the meter on when you get into the taxi and turn it off when you arrive at yo ur destination, or the place you are going to. Then that machine tells both of you h ow much money you need to give to the taxi driver. But in a ridesharing servi ce, there is no meter. Instead, you pay a “set (set) price.” A “set price” is an amount  of money that doesn’t change depending on how far you go.

Actually, ridesharing services do charge you depend ing on the distance between where you are now and where you want to go, but it isn’t exactly based on the number of miles or minutes it takes. So, it’s sort of a “set price.” It’s a set price before you start taking the trip. In a taxi, you of ten get charged for time that the taxi has to “sit in traffic,” we would say. So, if there are a lot of cars on the road and it takes the taxi a long time to get there, you  might have to pay more. That’s probably the biggest difference in terms of a taxi and a ridesharing service, for price.

Carl asks Doris, “How do we know it’s safe?” meanin g “How do we know this ridesharing service is safe?” “How do we know,” he continues, “the driver isn’t a criminal or an unsafe driver?” A “criminal” (crimin al) is a person who has broken the law, who has done something against the law. An  “unsafe driver” would be a driver who is not safe – who is dangerous, perhaps.  “Is he going to have car insurance?” Carl asks. “Car insurance” (insurance) is an agreement you have with an insurance company that says that if you get  into an accident, the insurance company will pay for all or some of the d amage caused.

Carl also asks, “Do they,” meaning the ridesharing services, “do background checks?” A “background check” (check) is when a com pany looks at your government records or other information to make sur e that you have not committed a crime in the past. Background checks are quite common now when people are hired by companies or by the government.  You can check to make sure the person hasn’t committed a crime before you  hire him. Carl is worried

that the driver might be a criminal – the driver of  the car they get from the ridesharing service, that is.

Doris says, “Even though it’s a peer-to-peer servic e, the drivers are carefully screened and the cars are tracked. Trust me. This r ide will be safe.” “Peer” (peer) refers to someone who is at the same level or who is in the same category as you are. We often use the word “peers” to refer to those people who have the same kind of job as we have. I might refer to my “p eers at the university” – people who work in jobs similar to my job, although  I no longer work at the university anymore.

“Peer-to-peer,” however, refers to a new kind of, w e would say, “business model” in which people sell their services to other people  even when they aren’t professionals. So, in a ridesharing service, I may own a car and give you a ride even though I’m not a professional driver, and char ge you money to give you that ride. That’s an example of a “peer-to-peer transact ion” or a “peer-to-peer exchange” of money and service.

The drivers, according to Doris, “are carefully scr eened.” “To screen” (screen) here means to review or check someone to make sure that he is qualified, that he meets your requirements. If cars are “tracked” ( tracked), they are being monitored or followed so that someone knows the loc ation of that car, someone knows where that car is.

Carl says, “We don’t have much cash on us,” meaning  we don’t have a lot of dollar bills or coins with us. Doris says, “I have a credit card on file. No cash will change hands.” A “credit card on file” (file) means  that you have your credit card information in a computer database or in the system  of the company that runs the ridesharing service. If you order things from a web site like Amazon.com, you may have your credit card “on file,” meaning when you b uy something you don’t have to put your credit card information into the system  again. It already has that information. It is already on file.

Doris says, “No cash will change hands.” “To change  hands” here simply means that one person gives something to another person in exchange for money or some other object. So, if we say “money changed han ds,” we mean I gave money to someone who gave me something back. It’s j ust another way of saying “to pay for something” – in this case, with cash. T hat’s why Doris says, “No cash will change hands,” meaning we don’t have to give h im dollar bills – we can simply use our credit card.

Then she says, “Look, here’s our driver. Hello, Mic hael.” Carl says, “You know our driver?” He’s surprised that Doris knows who Mi chael is. Doris says, “He’s my son.” Carl says, “But why are you paying for a r ide if your son is available to pick us up?” I think this is a good question. Doris  doesn’t really have a good answer. She says, “He has his pride” (pride). “Prid e” here refers to one’s feeling of self-respect or self-worth – that what you do is  worth something.

“He won’t take any money from me so we came up with  a compromise: I hire his car whenever I need a ride to or from the airport.”  So Doris and her son have an arrangement. He doesn’t like taking money directly from Doris, from his mother – I mean, what son would ask his mother to give him m oney to give him a ride? So instead, Doris says that they “came up with,” or th ey found, “a compromise” (compromise).

A “compromise” is an agreement between two people o r two groups of people in which each person or group gives something to the o ther. They reach an agreement to exchange something. In this case, Doris and her son have a compromise. She won’t give him money directly. She will give the money to the ridesharing service who will then give that money –  or part of that money, really – to her son, Michael. It sounds like a pretty dumb a rrangement to me, but that’s what Doris and her son have come up with.

She says, “I hire (hire) his car.” “To hire” here m eans to arrange to use or to be transported in his car. She says, “It works for us and there’s a bonus.” A “bonus” (bonus) is some additional benefit, some additional  thing you get in addition to the main benefit. Carl says, “What’s that?” Doris s ays, “I get to see my son every time I travel.”

Carl says, rightly, “That seems like a strange arra ngement,” meaning a strange agreement that you two have, or a strange, unusual situation to be in. Doris says, “That may be so,” meaning maybe you’re right, “but if you can’t get your son to visit more often, what’s a mother to do?” Doris is saying that because her son won’t come and visit her, she has this arrangement.  She doesn’t know what else she can do.

That’s what she means by that final expression, “Wh at’s a mother to do?” You could say, “What’s a father to do?” or “What’s a br other to do?” or “What’s a boss to do?” The form of the expression – “What’s a (som eone) to do?” – means you don’t have any other options or any other choices. This is the only thing you can do. Doris thinks the only way she can see her son is to pay to have him take her to the airport.

 Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
