This episode is called “Spending Time with Family.”  It’ s a dialogue between Claus and Marcia about spending a lot of time with your  family, something that can be a good thing, although sometimes it can be a di fficult thing.  Let’s get started.

[start of dialogue]

Claus:  Go home.  You need to spend more time with you r loved ones before they report you missing.

Marcia:  This is the busy season.  Do you think I have time  to stop to smell the roses when I have work coming out of my ears?

Claus:  It’s true we’re busy, but you get too wrapped up  in your work.  How old are your daughters?

Marcia:  They’re six and nine.

Claus:  Right.  Before you know it, they’ll be grown a nd you’ll have missed out on their childhood.  Take it from someone who knows.  Don’ t take your family for granted.

Marcia:  I know you’re right.  I need to spend more qu ality time with them – just as soon as the busy season is over.

Claus:  Time slips by while you’re not paying attention.  Look at me.  I worked my butt off to get where I am now, but at what cost?  M y wife and I are practically strangers and I barely know my children.  You don’t want  to end up like me.

 Marcia:  So I should see you as a cautionary tale?

Claus:  Yup.  Consider this a public service announcement.

We’re at work with Claus and Marcia.  Claus says to Marci a, “Go home.  You need to spend more time with your loved ones before t hey report you missing.” “Your loved ones” are the people you love, usually your cl ose relatives, your family.  “To report (someone) missing” means to go usual ly to the police to officially say that you don’t know where this other person  is, so the police may start looking for that person.  Claus is joking here; he’ s saying that Marcia has been away from her family so much that they will think she  has disappeared.

Marcia says, “This is a busy season.”  A “busy season” is a time  of the year when there is a lot of work to do, more work than normal.  Marcia says, “Do you think I have time to stop to smell the roses when I have work comi ng out of my ears?” “To stop to smell the roses,” or “to stop and smell the roses” means to relax, to take time to do things that are perhaps not very importa nt but that are very pleasant.  There was actually a song, I think in the 1970 s:

You gotta stop and smell the roses .

That’s all I remember, just that line.  I think that w as Mac Davis, remember him? No, me neither!  Marcia says, “I have work coming out of m y ears.”  The expression “to have (something) come out of your ears” mea ns that you have too much of something; you’re overwhelmed by all the things t hat you have or things that you have to do.  In this case, Marcia has too many thi ngs to do.

Claus says, “It’s true we’re busy, but you get too wrapped up in your work.”  “To be wrapped (wrapped) up” means to be very involved in som ething, thinking about something so much that you forget about everything  else, you’re absorbed. Typically, we use this when we’re talking about work or so me commitments. Claus says, “How old are your daughters?”  Marcia says, “The y’re six and nine.” Claus says, “Right.  Before you know it (before you realize ), they’ll be grown and you’ll have missed out on their childhood.”  “To miss out on (something)” is a phrasal verb meaning not to be able to enjoy something,  to lose or waste an opportunity.  “Don’t miss out on the sale on televisions a t the store,” don’t lose the opportunity to take advantage of it.  Claus is telli ng Marcia not to miss out on the childhood of her children; he says, “Take it from some one who knows.”  This expression, “take it from someone who knows,” or “take it  from someone who

 (plus another verb)” means listen to my advice; learn from  another person’s experience.  If somebody asked me about the freeways here i n Los Angeles, I would say, “Well, take it from someone who drives a lot o n the freeway, they’re terrible.”  Which is true!  Claus says, “Don’t take your f amily for granted.”  “To take (something or someone) for granted” means not to a ppreciate something or someone; to think that you’ll always have this thing or th is person in your life, and so you don’t make any effort to keep it, him, or her.  That’s to take something for granted, to assume that you will always have it.

Marcia says, “I know you’re right.  I need to spend more quality time with them.” “Quality time” is a period of time where you’re truly f ocused on another person; you try to get as much enjoyment from that other person a s possible.  Marcia says, “just as soon as the busy season is over,” meaning I’ll spend time with them as soon as the busy season is over.

Claus says, “Time slips by while you’re not paying attention .”  “To slip by” means to pass almost without noticing, to happen without you r ealizing it.  Time goes quickly, you don’t even realize how fast it is going by; it is passing.  “Slip,” as well as the word “wrap” that we talked about earlier, have a couple of different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some ad ditional explanations. So, Claus is saying to Marcia, “Time slips by while you’re n ot paying attention.” He says, “Look at me (consider me, for example).  I worked my butt off to get where I am now.”  “To work your butt (butt) off” is a n informal expression meaning to work very hard, to put a lot of effort into  doing something.  Claus says, “I worked my butt off to get where I am now (to g et to my current position in the company), but at what cost?”  This is a phrase we use t o talk about something that we were able to achieve but it had a l ot of negative consequences.  Some athletes use drugs (steroids) to become champions, but at what cost?  They could be hurting their body.

Claus says, “My wife and I are practically strangers and I ba rely know my children.”  A “stranger” is someone you don’t know or som eone you’ve never met before.  He, of course, is exaggerating; they’re not str angers, they know each other; they’re married to each other.  But because he h as spent so much time away from her, they don’t know each other as well; they’r e not as close anymore. He says, “I barely know my children,” meaning I almost don’ t know them or I don’t know them very well.  Claus says, “You don’t want to  end up like me.”  “To end up” means to become, in this case; to result in af ter a long period of time.

Marcia says, “So I should see you as a cautionary tale?”  A  “cautionary tale” is a story about something sad or dangerous that has happened to another person, and it makes you want to change your own behavior.  You start thinking about

 that, and you think, “Oh, I don’t want that to happe n to me.”  A “tale” (tale) is another word for a story.  “Cautionary” comes from “ca ution,” meaning be careful. So, it’s a story that warns you about something bad that could happen if you’re not careful.

Claus says, “Yup,” which is an informal way of saying yes – yup .  The opposite of “yup” is “nope” (nope).  Those are informal ways of sayin g yes (yup) and no (nope).  Claus says, “Yup.  Consider this a public service an nouncement.” “Consider,” here, means think about this in a certain way, think about this statement.  “Consider this (meaning his story) a public ser vice announcement.” A “public service announcement,” sometimes abbreviated “PS A,” is an advertisement on the radio or television that is not for any product or service; it’s not somebody trying to make money.  Instead, it’s from the  government or from social groups that are trying to get people to change their behavior or to give them information they need to know.  For example, ther e might be a PSA – a public service announcement about getting a flu shot; it  tells you about the importance of that.  Here, Claus is sort of joking, sayi ng my story is like a public service announcement, it’s giving you information you need to know.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a norma l speed.

Claus:  Go home.  You need to spend more time with you r loved ones before they report you missing.

Marcia:  This is the busy season.  Do you think I have time  to stop to smell the roses when I have work coming out of my ears?
