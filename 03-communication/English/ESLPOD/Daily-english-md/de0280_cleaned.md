This episode is called “Viral Marketing.”  “Marketing” is a way that companies let other people know about their products and services – what they are selling.  Let's get started.  > Jayna:  I have an idea for creating buzz about our new product.    Maksym:  What is it?  Jayna:  I think we should use viral marketing.  We can spread information about the product quickly and among the most likely customers.  Maksym:  I really don’t understand it.  How would we do viral marketing?    Jayna:  Well, the key is to get plugged into a few people who have large social networks already, such as bloggers and other people with popular websites.  We get them talking about the product on their websites and people who visit those websites will tell their friends about it, and they will in turn tell their friends, and so on.  If we use these existing social networks, news about our product will spread very quickly.    Maksym:  What about the cost?  Jayna:  That’s just it.  It’s very low-cost because it works through word of mouth.
