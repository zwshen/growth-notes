[start of dialogue]

Clerk: Hello, how can I help you?

Spencer: I’d like to return a few things I received  over the holidays.

Clerk: Okay, do you have gift receipts?

Spencer: I do for this item. It’s unopened and unus ed.

Clerk: Let me see. I can give you a refund, but the re will be a small restocking fee.

Spencer: Really?

Clerk: I’m afraid so.

Spencer: Okay, that’s fine. I also received this on e as a gift, but don’t have a receipt.

Clerk: Let me look up that merchandise in our syste m. It looks like it was a clearance item and it was a final sale.

Spencer: But it’s unworn.

Clerk: I understand that. The best I can do is to a llow you to exchange it if it doesn’t fit or give you store credit.

Spencer: I’ll take the store credit. What about thi s?

Clerk: Let me see. That item was purchased on our o nline store and it can’t be returned to a store location, only through our webs ite.

Spencer: And this? It doesn’t work.

Clerk: I’m sorry, but that was also a clearance ite m and was sold in as-is condition.

Spencer: [sigh] All right.

Clerk: Can I help you with anything else?

Spencer: Only if you can visit the other three stor es to return the rest of my gifts.

Clerk: You didn’t get you wanted for the holidays, huh?

Spencer: My family and friends have great senses of  humor, but how many gag gifts can one man own?

[end of dialogue]

Our dialogue begins with a “clerk” (clerk) saying s omething to Spencer. A clerk is a person who works usually at a store who helps you  buy things there, who takes your money. This clerk begins by saying to Spencer,  “Hello, how can I help you?” “How can I help you?” is a normal way that someone such as a clerk would ask what you need when you come into a store.

Spencer says, “I’d like to return a few things I re ceived over the holidays.” “To return something to a store” is to bring it back ei ther to get money or to get something else, maybe the same item. If you bought a shirt and it was too small, you might return it to the store to get a bigger shirt, or you might simply return it to get your money back – that is, they would give y ou the money that you paid for it back.

Now, in the case of Spencer, he didn’t actually buy  these things from the store. He received them over the holidays. “The holidays” refers, in the United States, to the Christian holiday of Christmas and the Jewis h holiday of Hanukkah during

which people often give gifts. The clerk says, “Oka y, do you have gift receipts?” A “receipt” (receipt) is a piece of paper showing w here something was bought and how much was paid for it. Stores usually give y ou a receipt when you buy things from them.

A “gift receipt” is when you buy a gift for another  person, but include a piece of paper from the store, a receipt, in case the person  wants to bring the gift back. Yes, in the United States, it is not uncommon for p eople to give a gift with a receipt in case the person doesn’t like the gift. I t’s a little strange, but it has become common in the last several years. Spencer sa ys, “I do for this item,” meaning he has a gift receipt for one of the “items ” (items) or things that were bought from that store.

He says this item or thing is “unopened and unused. ” “Unopened” means not opened. In this case, it refers to something that i s in the original box or package that it was when it was first bought from the store . To say something is “unused” (unused) means it has never been used. You didn’t t ake it out and use it for an hour and then put it back in the box. Sometimes sto res will only accept returns – that is, allow you to bring something back for mone y – if it is unopened and unused. If you bought a shirt, put it on, wore it t o a party, took it off, and then brought it to the store to get your money back, wel l, that would not be an unused shirt. You “used” the shirt.

The clerk says, “Let me see,” meaning let me look a t it. She says, “I can give you a refund, but there will be a small restocking fee. ” A “refund” (refund) is money that you get back because you return something or b ecause perhaps you aren’t happy with what you bought. Now, this is a “refund, ” but it’s not going to the person who bought the item. It’s going to the perso n who received the item – in this case, Spencer.

The clerk says there will be a “small restocking (r estocking) fee (fee).” A “restocking fee” is a small amount of money that a store or company will charge you or will take away from your refund for acceptin g the item back. You don’t get 100 percent, in other words, of the money you paid.  The store is going to keep a small percentage. They call that a “restocking fee. ” “To restock” means to take something and put it back on the shelves of a store  or to put it back where it can be sold again.

This is quite common nowadays if you buy electronic  goods, such as a computer. The store will take the computer back, but it won’t  give you 100 percent of the money. It will keep some of the money as a restocki ng fee. Spencer is surprised by this. He says, “Really?” The clerk says, “I’m af raid so.” “I’m afraid so” is a

polite, formal way of saying yes, especially when y ou are telling someone something that the person doesn’t like or is not happy with. Spencer says, “Okay, that’s fine,” meaning no problem.

He continues, “I also received this one as a gift, but I don’t have a receipt.” The clerk says, “Let me look up that merchandise in our  system.” “To look up” is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to find something – i n this case, to find something on a computer system. The word “merchandi se” (merchandise) is a word that means things that you buy and sell. It’s a general term for anything that is sold. So, in the title of this episode we have “ Returning and Exchanging ‘Merchandise.’” Merchandise is something you buy at  a store.

The clerk looks up the merchandise – the item, the thing – that Spencer wants to return and says that “It looks like,” meaning it ap pears, this thing “was a clearance item and it was a final sale.” A “clearan ce (clearance) item” is something that a store sells usually at a very low price because it is getting rid of that particular kind of thing. It is no longer goin g to be selling that particular item. In order to get rid of them, it has a “clearance sa le.”

The clerk says that this item was “bought as a fina l sale.” A “final sale” means you can’t bring it back. If you go into a store and  you see a sign that says “All sales are final” (final), that means that when you buy something, you do not have the option of bringing it back. If you buy it, you can’t return it.

Spencer complains that it’s “unworn” (unworn). We’v e had several words in this dialogue with the prefix “un” (un). “Un” is usually  used to mean “not.” So, “unused” is not used. “Unopened” is not opened. “Un worn” is not worn. “Worn” means that you have used a particular piece of clot hing. We use the verb “to wear” (wear) to refer to putting clothes on your bo dy. “I am wearing a shirt.” “I am wearing pants.” If an item is “unworn,” that means you’ve never put it on your body – a piece of clothing that has never been worn .

The clerk says, “I understand that,” meaning I unde rstand that this piece of clothing has never been worn. She says, “The best I  can do,” meaning the best possible deal I can give you, “is to allow you to e xchange it if it doesn’t fit you or give you store credit.” “To exchange” (exchange) me ans to bring something into a store that you bought there and get something ver y similar to that item. I gave the example before of buying a shirt that is too sm all for you. You go to the store and you exchange that shirt for a bigger shirt that  fits you – that is, that is the right size for you.

The clerk says that Spencer can exchange this piece  of clothing, or she can give him “store credit” (credit). “Store credit” is usua lly a piece of paper or some other way that the store gives you money that you can spe nd in the store for something else. So you buy something for $10. You don’t like it. You bring it back to the store. The store doesn’t give you $10. It says, “We ll you can buy something else in our store for $10.” That’s “store credit.”

Spencer says, “I’ll take the store credit.” Then he  says, “What about this?” showing her something else. The clerk says, “Let me  see. That item was purchased on our online store and it can’t be retur ned to a store location, only through our website.” An “online (online) store” is  a website where you can buy something on the internet. Many stores have online stores as well as physical stores – stores you can drive your car to and walk into. Some stores don’t allow you to buy things online and then return it to one of their physical stores, and that’s what the clerk is telling Spencer.

Spencer then shows the clerk something else. He say s, “And this? It doesn’t work” (work). “To work” here means to function prop erly. If something “doesn’t work,” it’s broken. It doesn’t do what it’s suppose d to do. A television that you can’t watch because there’s no picture is a broken television. It doesn’t work. The clerk says, “I’m sorry, but that was also a clearan ce item and was sold in as-is condition.”

If something is sold in “as (as) – is (is) conditio n,” that means once you buy it, you can’t return it, even if it is broken. Usually something is sold in “as-is“ condition when it’s already broken or when there’s already a problem with it. You can’t buy it and then say, “Oh, it’s broken. I want  to bring it back.” You bought it in “as-is condition.” You knew that it wasn’t perfect when you bought it, and you can’t return it.

Spencer is not very happy. He says, “All right.” the clerk then says, “Can I help you with anything else?” Spencer says, “Only if you  can visit the three other stores to return the rest of my gifts.” Spencer is making a joke here. The clerk isn’t really asking him if she can do anything for him. So when she asks if she can help him with anything else, she doesn’t mean h elping him go to other stores and return his other gifts.

She then says, “You didn’t get what you wanted for the holidays, huh?” Spencer says, “My family and friends have great senses of h umor, but how many gag gifts can one man own?” A “sense (sense) of humor (humor) ” is the ability to find things funny, to laugh. He says his friends and fam ily “have great senses of humor,” meaning that they know how to laugh. They l ike to be funny. “But,” he

 says, “how many gag (gag) gifts can one man own?” A  “gag gift” is a gift that is intended to be or is supposed to be funny. It’s not  a nice thing. It’s supposed to make you laugh.

Spencer’s friends and family gave him a lot of gag gifts for the holidays instead of real gifts. The joke here is that, in the United St ates, there is a famous store called “Spencer’s” that sells mostly gag gifts – th ings like cups and mugs with funny sayings on them, and similar things that peop le think are supposed to be funny. Because his name is Spencer, they gave him a ll of these gag gifts because there’s a famous store that sells gag gifts  named “Spencer’s.”

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
