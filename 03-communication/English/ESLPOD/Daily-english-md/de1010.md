# Using GPS When Driving

Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast num ber 1,010 – Using GPS When Driving.

This is English as a Second Language Podcast episod e 1,010 – or we could say, “ten-ten.” My name is Dr. Jeff McQuillan. I’m comin g to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, C alifornia.

[start of dialogue]

Justin: Okay, we’re ready. Let’s get on the road.

Fay: Wait! We don’t know where we’re going. We’re s trangers in a strange land. Where’s our guide?

Justin: We don’t need a guide. See this? It’s GPS a nd it’ll help us navigate to where we want to go.

Fay: I’m not sure it’s reliable. We’re in a pretty remote location.

Justin: Relax and let me explain how this works: GP S systems use satellites to locate your current location. Information is transm itted to this receiver, so it always knows exactly where we are. We input the add ress of our destination and presto! It gives us onscreen or voice directions.

Fay: I know how a GPS system works. I’m worried tha t there aren’t reliable maps to where we want to go. I read that many printed ma ps of this region are outdated and unreliable.

Justin: Don’t worry. This GPS is the state-of-the-a rt. I’m sure it’ll be accurate.

Fay: A fool with a tool is still a fool.

Justin: What did you say?

Fay: Nothing.

Our dialogue begins with Justin saying to Fay, “Oka y, we’re ready. Let’s get on the road.” “Let’s get on the road” means let’s get moving. Let’s get into the car and leave. Fay says, “Wait! We don’t know where we’ re going. We’re strangers in a strange land.” A “stranger” is someone you don’t know. A stranger can also be someone from a different country or city or state w ho is visiting or who has moved to a new place and is unfamiliar with that pl ace.

The phrase “stranger in a strange land” is familiar  to some Americans because it was the title of a book written back in the early 1 960s. In any case, we’re not talking about a book. We’re talking about Fay and J ustin. Fay says to Justin, “Where’s our guide?” A “guide” (guide) is normally a person who leads a group of people on a tour or who helps someone get to the pl ace where they want to go.

Justin says, “We don’t need a guide. See this?” He’ s asking Fay to look at something he’s pointing to or holding. “See this? I t’s GPS and it’ll help us navigate to where we want to go.” “GPS,” which stan ds for “Global Positioning System,” is an electronic device or part of an elec tronic device that helps you identify where you are right now and gives you dire ctions about how to get somewhere you want to go.

Many cars now have GPS devices in them, so you can put the information about where you are going into this small computer, and it will tell you how to get to where you want to go from where you are now. Many s martphones have this feature. For example, my phone has a feature on it that I use as basically a GPS device. I open my map application and enter the add ress where I am going, and it will tell me how to get there.

Justin says that GPS will help them navigate to whe re they want to go. “To navigate” (navigate) means to figure out the best w ay to get to your destination, to the place where you’re going. If you are navigat ing in your car, you are deciding which route to take – which way to go in o rder to arrive at the place you want to go. Fay says, “I’m not sure it’s reliable.”  Something that is “reliable” is something that is trustworthy, something that you can count on, something you can depend on.

Fay is not sure the GPS is something they can depen d on. She says, “We’re in a pretty remote location.” “Remote” (remote) means fa r from areas where people live and work – to be a great distance from where m ost people are. If you are in

the middle of the desert, you are in a remote locat ion. You are not close to any city or town, or perhaps even other people.

Justin says, “Relax and let me explain how this wor ks: GPS systems use satellites to locate your current location.” A “sat ellite” (satellite) is a machine that is located many miles above the earth, that goes ar ound the earth and is used to communicate radio signals or other electronic signa ls from one part of the earth to another. Satellites are used for other things as  well, of course.

A GPS satellite is used to help locate where a pers on is or a certain thing is. In the dialogue, the GPS satellites are used to locate  your current location. “Current” means where you are right now. “Location”  means where you are. So, your “current location” would be where you are righ t now as we are speaking. Justin continues, “Information is transmitted to th is receiver so it always knows exactly where we are.”

“To transmit” (transmit) means to send – specifical ly, to send electronic information. A “receiver” is something that receive s an electronic signal. Your television is a receiver. It receives electronic si gnals. It doesn’t send, typically, electronic signals – that would be called a “transm itter,” from the verb “to transmit.” A receiver receives the signals that are  transmitted.

Justin says, “We input the address of our destinati on and presto! It gives us onscreen or voice directions.” “To input” (input) m eans to enter information into a machine such as a computer. Your “destination” (des tination) is the place where you’re going. Justin says, “We input the address of  our destination and presto!” “Presto” (presto) is an informal word used to annou nce that something has been done and is now finished, especially when it was do ne very quickly and easily, without a lot of work or effort.

Justin says if they put the address of their destin ation into the GPS computer, it will give them “onscreen or voice directions.” “Ons creen” means that it appears on a small electronic screen, sort of like what you  have on your smartphone or your computer. “Voice directions” – voice direction s are words spoken by the computer, the GPS computer, that tell you where you  should go.

So, typically you would hear things like, “Turn lef t at the next intersection.” An “intersection” is a place where two roads or street s cross. Or the GPS system may say something like, “In two miles, turn right o n Highway 25.” I think I should try to get a job as the voice of the GPS system. I think that would be kind of fun. They could record me, and then people could listen to me as they were driving,

and I would tell them where to go. That would be a little weird, I think. But back to our dialogue . . .

Fay says, “I know how a GPS system works. I’m worri ed that there aren’t reliable maps to where we want to go.” Fay is saying that sh e understands the technology of GPS. She’s just worried that there ar en’t good maps of the areas where they’re going to travel, and therefore the GP S system won’t be able to help them. She says, “I read that many printed maps  of this region are outdated and unreliable.”

When something is “outdated” (outdated) – one word – we mean that it has old information that is no longer accurate, perhaps bec ause things have changed. We also use the word “outdated” to describe somethi ng that is no longer fashionable or modern. We might talk about a certai n style of clothing as being outdated, or certain ideas as being outdated.

Justin says, “Don’t worry. This GPS system is the s tate-of-the-art.” That expression, “state-of-the-art” (art), refers to the  most modern, most current technology – something that is the latest in some p articular technology or process. “State-of-the-art computers” would be comp uters that are new, that have the best and newest technology. Justin says, “ I’m sure it’ll be accurate.” “To be accurate” means to have the correct information.

Fay says, “A fool with a tool is still a fool.” This is actually an expression that my sister taught me. “A fool with a tool is still a fo ol.” A “fool” (fool) is a stupid person, or a person who isn’t very intelligent. A “tool” (t ool) is something you use to get something done. It’s an instrument.

The expression means that just because you have a t ool – just because you have, in this case, technology – doesn’t mean that you aren’t stupid. You need to know how to use the technology. The technology does n’t make you smart. You have to know how to use it. So, a fool with a tool is still a fool. The tool doesn’t take away, if you will, his stupidity. A machine do esn’t make you smart. If you’re not smart, having the machine won’t help. That’s the idea behind that expression.

Justin says, “What did you say?” Sometimes when we don’t hear what another person says to us, we may say, “What did you say?” If you say it in a certain way, however, you’re sort of implying that you heard wha t the person said and you weren’t very happy with what he or she said. The wa y Justin says, “What did you say?” implies that he understood what Fay said, and  he understood that Fay was insulting him.

Fay, however, simply says, “Nothing,” meaning what I said to you isn’t a very important and I’m not going to say it again. I’m no t going to repeat it for you.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.

Justin: Okay, we’re ready. Let’s get on the road.

Fay: Wait! We don’t know where we’re going. We’re s trangers in a strange land. Where’s our guide?
