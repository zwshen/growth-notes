<h1>Problem E - Speedy Escape</h1>
<h3>Time limit: X seconds</h3>
<!-- author: Marcus Isaksson -->

<p>
The Newton brothers are planning to rob a bank in the city of Alviso
and want to figure out a way to escape the city's only police car.
They know that their car is faster than the police car so if they
could just reach one of the highways exiting the city they will be
able to speed away from the police.

<p>
The police car has a maximum speed of 160 km/h.  Luckily, the brothers
know where the police car will start (it's parked at the police
station).  To be on the safe side they assume that the police car will
start moving as soon as they leave the bank and start their car (this
is when the alarm goes off).

<p>
The brothers want to find a fixed route that ensures that they are
able to leave the city no matter what route the police car take and at
what speed it drives.  However, since the brothers are not very
confident drivers they don't want to drive faster than necessary.
Luckily they have recently invested in a new hi-tech in-car police
escape system that <i>you</i> have constructed.  This system will tell
them what the minimal top speed needed to escape is (and probably
other useful things like what route to take).

<p>
Let's turn the clock back a bit to the time when you were constructing
the escape system and focused on finding the minimal required
speed. Can you get it right?

<p>
<i>You may treat all roads as infinitesimally narrow and both cars as
point objects.  If the brothers ever end up at the same point (on any
road or intersection) at the same time as the police car they will be
caught and by Murphy's law if there is any possibility of this
happening it will happen.  The two cars start simultaneously and can
accelerate/decelerate instantaneously at any time to any speed below
or equal to its maximum speed.  They can also change roads at
intersections or direction anywhere on a road instantaneously no
matter what speed they are traveling at.
</i>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N<32) which denotes the total number of test cases.
The description of each test case is given below:<br><br>

The first line consists of three integers <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> and
<i>e</i>, where <i>2 &le; n &le; 100</i> describe the number of
intersections, <i>1 &le; m &le; 5000</i> describes the number of roads
in the city and <i>1 &le; e &le; n</i> describes the number of highway
exits.  Then follow <i>m</i> lines, each consisting of three
integers <i>a,b,l</i> such that <i>1 &le; a &lt; b &le; n</i> and <i>1
&le; l &le; 100</i> describing a road of length <i>l</i> hundred
meters from intersection <i>a</i> to intersection <i>b</i>.  Then
follows a line of <i>e</i> integers, each one a number in <i>1, ...,
n</i> describing which intersections are connected to highway exits.
Finally there is a line with two integers <i>b</i> and <i>p</i> (<i>1
&le; b,p &le; n</i> and <i>b &ne; p</i>) describing the intersections
where the brothers and the police cars start, respectively.

<p>
<i>It will always be possible to travel from any intersection to any
other intersection.  Roads are only connected at intersection points
(although they may cross using bridges or tunnels at others points).
Roads can be used in both directions but there cannot be more than one
road between two intersections.
</i>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each test case print the minimal speed in km/h required to escape or the word
<tt>IMPOSSIBLE</tt> if it is impossible.  If the output is not "IMPOSSIBLE", any answer
with either absolute or relative error smaller
than <i>10<sup>-6</sup></i> is acceptable.
