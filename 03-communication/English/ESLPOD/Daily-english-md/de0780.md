[start of dialogue]

Ally:  Hello, Ally McNeal.

Jerry:  Ally, this is Jerry Mason.  I need to talk to you right away.  We’re being sued and we’ve just been served.  This is one of th ose times I wish we had in- house counsel.

Ally:  Jerry, you know that our firm will do its be st to represent you, as we’ve done in the past.  You can count on me and all of t he attorneys in this office. How about if I come to your office this afternoon a nd we can discuss it?

Jerry:  Okay, that’s great.

Ally:  In the meantime, can you give me a brief run down?

Jerry:  Yeah, we’re being sued for negligence.  In fact, it’s a class action suit against our company

Ally:  All right.  Can you fax or email me the pape rs so I can see what they’re alleging?

Jerry:  Yes, I can do that.  We really need your he lp with this, Ally.  A lawsuit like this could ruin a company like ours.

Ally:  Don’t panic.  We’ll take a look at it and se e if there’s any merit in the case. It might just be a frivolous lawsuit.

Jerry:  If they have a case, you’ll have to find a loophole to get us out of this, or negotiate a settlement.  The last thing I want is t o go to court.

Ally:  Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  We’ll dis cuss it this afternoon.  And Jerry?

Jerry:  Yeah?

Ally:  In the meantime, try to lay off the coffee.

Our phone conversation begins with Ally answering t he phone, and like a lot of people do in a professional situation they answer b y saying, “Hello,” and then their name or the name of their company.  So Ally s ays, “Hello, Ally McNeal,” and the other person says, “Ally, this is Jerry Mason.  I need to talk to you right away (right now).”  He says, “We’re being sued.”  “To su e (sue) (someone)” as a verb means to go to the court, to go to a judge and say that this person did something wrong and they owe you money, they should pay you m oney for something they did wrong to you.  They hurt you or damaged you or your company in some way. Not physically damaged, although it could be that, but it could also just be some sort of financial loss, money that you lost because  of something they did.  Jerry says that their company is being sued and we’ve jus t been served.  “To be served” in this case means to receive legal papers from the court notifying you – telling you that you are being served or that you m ust take some sort of legal action.  Jerry says, “This is one of those times (o ne of those instances or situations) I wish we had in-house counsel.”  “Coun sel” (counsel) means a lawyer, an attorney, someone who is knowledgeable a bout the law.  “In-house” (in-house) means working for your company.  Some co mpanies are big, and they have their own lawyers and their own accountants.  Smaller companies usually don’t, so they don’t have a lawyer in-house, inside  of the company, who works full time, permanently for the company.

Ally says, “Jerry, you know that our firm will do its best to represent you.”  So now we understand that Ally is someone who works for a company of lawyers – a group of lawyers.  We call a group of lawyers “a gr oup of thieves.”  No, I’m just kidding!  We call a group of lawyers a “firm” (firm ).  The law firm is a group of lawyers who work together.  So Ally says that her f irm will do its best to represent you.  “To represent (someone)” in this case means t o be their official

representative.  Really, here it just means to be t heir lawyer, to be their attorney, to be the person that will give them legal advice.  Ally says, “You can count on me (you can rely on me or depend on me) and all of the attorneys in this office.” “Attorney” (attorney) is just another word for a la wyer, a little more formal word perhaps, but they mean the exact same thing.  Ally says, “How about if I come to your office this afternoon and we can discuss it?”  What do you think of that idea, “how about if…?”

Jerry says, “Okay, that’s great.”  Ally says, “In t he meantime (meaning until that happens), can you give me a brief rundown?”  A “run down” (rundown – one word) is a brief summary; a short summary or descri ption of what happened, of some problem or some event.  Jerry says, “Yeah, we’ re being sued for negligence.”  “Negligence” (negligence) is when you ’re not careful, when you don’t do what you are supposed to do and then someo ne gets hurt because of it. So, if you’re a company and you have a door that’s broken and if you open it you could hurt yourself.  So, someone comes to your bui lding and they open your door and they hurt themselves, they might sue you f or negligence.  You should have been more careful; you should have taken care of the problem.  Jerry says his company is being sued for negligence; it’s a cl ass action suit.  A “suit” (suit) is the legal action of suing someone.  The term “class  action” usually involves a court case with more than one person, usually a who le group of people who are suing you.  Often, it can be an entire category of customers.  So, some customers are mad about the way Starbucks serves it s coffee, so they file a class action lawsuit – a class action suit.  They’r e representing all of the customers of Starbucks, that’s the idea.

Ally says, “All right.  Can you fax or email the pa pers so I can see what they’re alleging?”  “To allege” (allege) is to say that som eone else did something wrong, to accuse someone else of doing something illegal o r wrong.  Jerry says, “Yes, I can do that (I can email you the papers).  We reall y need your help with this, Ally. A lawsuit like this could ruin a company like ours. ”  A “lawsuit,” again, is just another word for a “suit,” which is the legal actio n that someone takes against you.  When someone sues you, we say they have “file d a lawsuit.”

Ally says, “Don’t panic.  We’ll take a look at it a nd see if there’s any merit in the case.”  “Merit” (merit) is whether it’s of any valu e, if it’s worth anything, if it’s true. The word “merit” can also mean excellence, being go od at something, or some accomplishment.  Ally says, “It might just be a fri volous lawsuit.”  Something that is “frivolous” (frivolous) is not serious, somethin g that someone does but there isn’t a good reason to do it.  A frivolous lawsuit would be someone suing you over something that isn’t true or isn’t very import ant.

Jerry says, “If they have a case (meaning if they m ight have some merit to their argument), you’ll have to find a loophole to get us  out of this.”  A “loophole” (loophole – one word) is a part of the law that is poorly written or it’s not very exact, it’s not very precise so that people can fin d a way to not break the law by finding some exception to law, by finding some vagu eness or some imprecision in the law that allows them to still do something l egally.  Jerry says if there is a case here Ally and her law firm need to find a loop hole, or, if they don’t, to negotiate a settlement.  A “settlement” is when a c ompany agrees usually to pay the person who is suing them some money.  They say,  “Okay, we won’t go to the judge, we won’t have a legal case, we’ll just pay y ou some money and then you’ll sign a paper saying, ‘I’m not going to sue you anym ore.’”  Jerry says, “The last thing I want is to go to court.”  That means I don’ t want to have a trial, I don’t want to go to a judge.

Ally says, “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”  “To  get ahead of yourself” means to start planning or doing something before you sho uld, before you really know what you’re doing, or before you know you should be  doing it.  I have a friend who wants to get his driver’s license.  And even be fore he got his driver’s license, he went out and he was looking at cars to buy, and I told him, “Don’t get ahead of yourself,” meaning you can’t buy a car until you ge t your driver’s license, so don’t worry about that; start doing the things you should  be doing about getting your driver’s license.  That’s getting ahead of yourself .

Ally says, “Jerry?” and Jerry says, “Yeah?”  Ally s ays, “try to lay off the coffee.” “To lay off” (lay off) is a two-word phrasal verb m eaning to reduce the frequency or amount of something, to do something less.  “To lay off (something)” is to do less of it, in this case to drink less coffee becau se Jerry’s getting all excited, and when you drink coffee you get more caffeine, which can get you more excited than you should be.

Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
